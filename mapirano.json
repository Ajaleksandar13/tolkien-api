    "text": "The FIRST AGE began with the completion of Valinor, and ended with the\noverthrow of Morgoth. The First Age was also known as the ELDER DAYS.\n\nIt lasted about 3,000 Valian years, and each Valian year is the\nequivalent of 10 solar years.(making it the longest of the three Ages\ndescribed by Tolkien), and ended with the final overthrow of Morgoth by\nthe combined armies of Valinor and Beleriand.\n\n\n\nTolkien describes primarily the events that occurred in Beleriand. These\nwere centered on a series of wars waged by the Sindar, the Ñoldor and\nthe Three Houses of the Edain, against the power of Morgoth. The wars\nhad actually begun during the Years of the Trees, but began again with\nrenewed fury after the arrival of the Ñoldor in Beleriand. There had\nbeen Elves in Beleriand for uncounted millennia, but they sought merely\nto exist, and Morgoth had little to do with them. The Ñoldor, on the\nother hand, particularly the Sons of Fëanor, had come with the express\npurpose of defeating Morgoth.\n\nChief Battles of this Age\n\n-   The Dagor-nuin-Giliath, so named because it was fought before the\n    rising of the Sun) was fought soon after the arrival of the Ñoldor.\n    Morgoth sent a raiding party from Angband to attack the Ñoldor\n    encampment in Hithlum, but the elves drove it back. Fëanor was\n    killed. It is considered the second battle in the Wars of Beleriand,\n    after one that took place during the Years of the Trees.\n\n\n\n-   The Dagor Aglareb was fought about seventy-five years after the\n    return of the Ñoldor. Morgoth again attacked the Ñoldor, and (again)\n    with no success. The Ñoldor became so bold as to besiege Angband.\n    However, the Siege was of limited effectiveness, because the\n    northern side of Angband on the north side of the Ered Engrin, and\n    was unapproachable to the Elven forces.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The Dagor Bragollach began when Morgoth poured rivers of fire out of\n    Angband, ruining the besieging Ñoldorin armies. The Ñoldor\n    eventually mustered a defense, but their losses were severe. For\n    instance, the green plain of Ard-galen had been permanently laid\n    waste by the rivers of fire, and was now called _Anfauglith_, the\n    Choking Dust; and the highlands of Dorthonion, which had been\n    inhabited by Edain, were made inhospitable.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The Nirnaeth Arnoediad was the first battle to be started by the\n    Ñoldor for the purpose of ending the power of Morgoth. They massed\n    an army composed of Elves, Edain, and the Easterling houses of Bór\n    and Ulfang allied to the Sons of Fëanor. The Elves and their allies\n    came very close to Angband, but Morgoth's trickery had upset their\n    battle plan, and Ulfang proved to be treacherous. The name\n    “Unnumbered Tears” comes from the fact that the Elves' last hope of\n    victory was destroyed. The land of Hithlum was lost, the Sons of\n    Fëanor were largely scattered, and the free peoples of Beleriand had\n    been decimated. The forces of Morgoth made a heap of the Elven and\n    Mannish dead in the center of Anfauglith.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The War of Wrath took place after Eärendil sailed to Valinor and\n    persuaded the Valar to help those whom they had forsaken. The Valar\n    gathered an army comprised of Maiar, Vanyar, and those Ñoldor who\n    had stayed in Valinor. The Teleri refused their aid, due to the\n    Kinslaying at Alqualondë, but consented to ferry the armies of the\n    Valar in their famous ships. This battle marked the first appearance\n    of the winged dragons, most notably Ancalagon the Black, but the\n    Valar had the day. Morgoth was captured, and cast out of Arda, but\n    his lands, as well as most of Beleriand, had been destroyed and sunk\n    under the sea in the heat of battle."

They\n    were also called the FAITHFUL for their continued devotion and\n    obedience to the Valar. Their most noted leader was Elendil, Lord of\n    Andúnië, who later founded the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor in\n    Middle-earth.\n\nBy the close of the Second Age Númenóreans had become split between the\nElendili and the King's Men — a faction centered around the King that\nsought to assert Númenórean authority and self-determination. With\nNúmenor reaching the apex of its might, the King's Men eventually\nespoused open defiance of the Valar. This split would eventually\nprecipitate the Fall of Númenor.\n\nThe Elendili, however, not only preserved their ancient friendship with\nthe Elves, they also regarded the burgeoning arrogance of the King's Men\nas blasphemy. But the King's Men became more powerful, and by the end of\nthe Second Age had begun to persecute the Elendili as rebels and\ndissidents. Fearing their growing strength, the King's men secured the\nFaithful's deportation from their strongholds in the western regions,\nnotably around the city Andúnië.\n\nThe Elendili enjoyed a brief respite when Elf-friend Tar-Palantir\nassumed kingship and began to turn Númenor back to the ways of the\nFaithful. But after Tar-Panatir died, his nephew Ar-Pharazôn usurped the\nthrone and the Elendili were more vigorously oppressed, this time with\nthe help of the Dark Lord Sauron, who had established an evil cult on\nthe island to corrupt and eventually destroy Númenórean society.\n\nAs Ar-Pharazôn led his grand armada to Aman to challenge the Ban of the\nValar, Elendil and the remaining Elf-friends were warned by the divine\npowers to leave Númenor forever. They were thus spared the downfall of\nNúmenor when, as punishment for an attempt to defy the Ban, Ilúvatar\nsank the island kingdom into the sea.\n\nThe Elendili, under the leadership of Elendil and his sons, eventually\nmade their way to refuge in Middle-Earth where they were welcomed by the\nElves.

    "text": "These Were giant armored war beasts (most likely Mountain Trolls) that\nparticipated in the Battle of the Five Armies, in The Hobbit: The Battle\nof the Five Armies.\n\n\nStatistics\n\nThese trolls were very large, dwarfing all the others seen previously,\n(about 25 feet tall or more) more importantly they were either fully or\npartially armored, unlike the smaller yet extremely similar Guldur\nOlog-Hai, which were fully armored but as stated above much smaller\n(about the size of a regular troll in the films) These trolls were\nfearsome weapons on the field and devastated dozens of soldiers with one\nstrike alone of their weapons.\n\nThese trolls were quite intelligent and kept formation with the orcs as\nthey marched to battle, in battle these trolls carried bladed axe/sword\nlike weapons upon their arms, (similar to the Guldur Orcs's shields)\nlong metal maces which could smash the very earth several feet into the\nair, taking down several men at once. Some even used their bare hands,\nballing them up into fists to smash the allied armies, or sweeping them\nup and throwing them like rag-dolls.\n\nThe less fortunate of these trolls were also hideously amputated by the\norcs, giving them morning star (wrecking ball-like) arms in place of\ntheir flesh and blood ones, some had metal hooks placed into their backs\nfor goblins to take hold of, and the most unfortunate was blinded and\ngiven reigns dangling from their eye sockets for orcs to directly take\ncontrol of.\n\nThese trolls were probably Mountain Trolls from Gundabad in the northern\nmisty mountains, this would explain their height, and color of their\nskin (being a peach like hue) instead of the darker blue cave troll skin\nor dark grey olog-hai skin.\n\nUnlike the smaller Guldur Olog's these trolls couldn't simply be taken\ndown by a spear throw to the neck or a few arrows. It would take dozens\nof arrows and several spears/pikes to be sent into the unarmored parts\nof the trolls in order to take them down. A premeditated attack upon a\ntroll would usually work and need to be planned out well in order to\ntake out the beast before it took down a whole garrison.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThese trolls were used primarily in Azog the Defiler's Dol-Guldur orc\narmy, directed to come out as soon as Azog called for the war beasts,\nalmost immediately these trolls smashed into the allied army, causing\nmassive damage, when some of the orc regiments made their way to the\nruins of dale, some of these trolls joined them, climbing over the walls\nor simply smashing them down to gain access. One of these trolls was\neven given a stone headpiece to act as a battering ram to the walls of\ndale. Most of these trolls survived until the end of the battle, still\nfighting on when the bats of gundabad arrived. But once the Eagles\narrived, the remaining trolls either fled into the Were -Worm tunnels,\nor were eventually taken down by the combined allied forces."

    "page_id": "23",
    "text": "The FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING was formed as a brotherhood among members of\nthe various Free Peoples of Middle-earth. Its purpose was to take the\nOne Ring to Mordor that it might be cast into the fires of Mount Doom,\nthe mountain in which it was forged, so that it would be destroyed and\nultimately kill the Dark Lord Sauron.\n\nThe '''Fellowship '''was also known as the COMPANY OF THE RING, the NINE\nWALKERS, or more simply the COMPANY. Each of the members of the Company\nwere representatives of their respective races, with Legolas and Gimli\nbeing the only Elf and Dwarf chosen.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFormation\n\nFormed after the Council of Elrond, the Fellowship consisted of nine\nmembers: four Hobbits, two Men, one Elf, one Dwarf, and one Wizard. It\nis the only known organisation/group ever formed in the history of\nMiddle-earth, to hold members of each of these races within it (and with\nthe departure of the Elves and the Wizards from Middle-earth, there\nwould never be another like it), who largely lived and acted\nindependently of one another (or in the case of Elves and Dwarves, felt\nactive animosity toward each other). This number was chosen to match the\nnumber of Ring Wraiths, also known as Black Riders, the Nazgúl or the\nNine Riders. Merry and Pippin were never intended to be a part of the\nFellowship, with Elrond considering two Elf-lords from his own house. He\nwished to send the two younger hobbits back to the Shire as messengers\nto warn other Hobbits of the growing evil. However, the Halflings\npersevere: Merry is chosen and Gandalf convinces Elrond of the loyalty\nof Pippin.\n\n\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring was formed by Elrond after the Council of\nElrond. The Fellowship, being led mainly by Gandalf, headed down the\npath to Mordor.\n\nAfter a long and difficult journey south from Rivendell, and a\nnear-catastrophic attempt to cross over the Misty Mountains, the\nFellowship descended into Moria. In the former Dwarf-kingdom, they found\nevidence that Orcs had slain Gimli's kinsman Balin and other Dwarves who\nhad returned there. They were soon confronted by the Balrog known as\n_Durin's Bane_, who had many Orc and Troll minions under his control.\nGandalf fell facing this menace, and the Company was forced to go on\nwithout him.\n\nOnce they escaped Moria, the Fellowship headed to the Elven forest of\nLothlórien where they spoke with the Elven Lord Celeborn and Galadriel,\nLady of Light. Galadriel supplied them each with special Elven Gifts\nfrom Lothlórien, boats and supplies so that they could travel down the\nriver Anduin. This route was quicker than an overland march, but the\ngroup was attacked by Orc archers and shadowed by Gollum, who had begun\nfollowing them in Moria.\n\nForced to portage their boats around the waterfall called Rauros, the\nFellowship soon ran into difficulties. Boromir finally succumbed to\ntemptation, and attempted to seize the Ring from Frodo. This led to\nFrodo using the Ring to escape and he and Sam leaving to spare the\nothers the lure of it. The repentant Boromir died trying to defend Merry\nand Pippin against a large force of Uruks from Isengard.\n\nThe Fellowship was dissolved on the banks of the Anduin that day. Frodo\nand Sam carried on towards Mordor; Boromir was given funerary rites and\nsent floating over the falls, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli departed on\ntheir way to save Merry and Pippin.\n\nBreaking of the Fellowship\n\nAfter Boromir died the Fellowship split into three paths. From there\nAragorn, Legolas and Gimli chased after the Uruk-hai who took Merry and\nPippin. Their plan was to take the hobbits to Saruman in Isengard. Along\nthe way the trio crossed through the Gap of Rohan and came across Éomer\nwho led the banished Riders of Rohan across the land. After questioning\nÉomer, they found out that the riders had already slain the Uruk-hai\nthey were meant to track, the night before in a bloody massacre. So upon\narriving to site of battle, Aragorn discovers that the hobbits fled deep\ninto Fangorn Forest.\n\nGandalf, though thought to be dead when he fell at the Bridge of Khazad\nDum in Moria, came back to Middle-earth, reincarnated as Gandalf the\nWhite. He encountered Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in Fangorn, and they,\nmistaking Gandalf for Saruman, attempted to kill him. Gandalf assured\nthem that Merry and Pippin were safe (knowing they were in the hands of\nTreebeard). From there they rode out to Edoras, capital of Rohan. It was\nthere they saw King Theoden in ill-condition, poisoned by Saruman's\nservant Grima Wormtongue.\n\nFrodo and Sam continued their journey, getting closer to Mordor. Gollum\nhad tailed them. While attempting to take “the precious” in their sleep,\nFrodo and Sam awoke and captured him. Frodo realizing who he was decided\nGollum could be used as guide into Mordor.\n\nThe Second Fellowship\n\nIn the book, Aragorn continues to call the company he leads (Legolas and\nGimli, occasionally joined by Gandalf, Merry, and Pippin) the Fellowship\nof the Ring even after the original Fellowship breaks up following\nBoromir's death. The fellowship is reunited again after the War of The\nRing up until Rohan, where the fellowship ends.\n\n  Name      Age\n  --------- ----------------------\n  Frodo     50\n  Samwise   38\n  Merry     36\n  Pippin    28\n  Aragorn   87\n  Boromir   40\n  Legolas   2000+\n  Gimli     139\n  Gandalf   2000+ (Middle-Earth)\n\n  : AGES OF THE MEMBERS (TA 3018)\n\n\nMembers",

    "text": "ARNOR, also known as the NORTHERN KINGDOM, was a kingdom of men located\nin the land of Eriador in Middle-earth. The name probably means “Land of\nthe King”, from Sindarin ARA- (high, kingly) + (N)DOR (land).\n\n\nHistory\n\nArnor was founded in SA 3320 by Elendil and sons who went on to found\nthe southern realm of Gondor. The history of the two kingdoms is\nintertwined; both kingdoms are known as the Realms of the Dúnedain in\nExile.\n\nBefore the foundation of Arnor there was already a sizable Númenórean\npopulation living there, a result of the slow emigration of Númenóreans\nwhich had started under Tar-Meneldur and Tar-Aldarion. Before the\narrival of the Dúnedain, Arnor was home to Middle Men of Edain stock,\nand the early colonists soon interbred with the indigenous population.\nArnor was originally favoured over the more southern regions (Gondor)\nbecause the Elves under Gil-galad lived near it across the river Lhûn.\nHowever, in later days after the Númenóreans fell under Sauron's shadow\nthey settled more to the south. This led to a situation where Elendil\narrived in an area populated by people who, unlike his own Númenóreans,\nwere mainly still friends with the Elves, and unlike Gondor to the south\nin Arnor much knowledge of the Elder Days was preserved.\n\nArnor's second king Isildur (also King of Gondor) was killed in TA 2 by\norcs in the disastrous Battle of the Gladden Fields. His three eldest\nsons were killed with him, but the fourth and youngest, Valandil,\nsurvived and became king of Arnor (TA 2 or 10?).\n\n\n\nBecause Valandil and his heirs did not claim the throne of Gondor the\nrealms were split, but Arnor's ruler kept the title High King, whereas\nin the south the ruler was just _King._ At its height, Arnor borders\nextended from the Ice-Bay of Forochel in the north, the river Greyflood\ndown to Belegaer in the south, the river Hoarwell in the east, and the\nriver Lune in the west. The capital city was Annúminas, and the realm\nincluded other cities such as Fornost, Tharbad, Lond Daer, and Tyrn\nGorthad.\n\nDecline\n\nHuman folly and the plots of a deathless evil had undone this dream.\nArnor was no more; divided into the three kingdoms of Arthedain,\nCardolan and Rhudaur, the Dúnedain of the North spent their strength in\nfoolish, petty wars and while corruption and ambition sapped their\nstrength, enemies gathered on their frontiers. Arnor's capital was\nAnnúminas on Lake Evendim, but by TA 861 Fornost Erain had become the\ncapital instead as Annúminas became depopulated.\n\nAfter the death of its tenth king, Eärendur, in 861, Arnor was shaken by\ncivil war between the three sons of Eärendur. The eldest son, Amlaith,\nclaimed Kingship over all Arnor but was reduced to only ruling the\nregion of Arthedain as his kingdom, while the other sons founded the\nkingdoms of Cardolan and Rhudaur.\n\nArnor was refounded in name by Arthedain's king Argeleb I, when Cardolan\nplaced itself under the suzerainty of Arthedain. However, even Arthedain\nwas eventually destroyed. The people of Arnor were mostly wiped out by\nthe wars, but the Hobbits survived in the Shire, men survived in Bree\nand probably other villages, and the Dúnedain of Arnor created new homes\nin the Angle south of Rivendell, where some of them became known as the\nRangers of the North.\n\nReunited Kingdom\n\nAragorn II as King Elessar refounded the Kingdom of Arnor as part of the\nReunited Kingdom, and made Annúminas his summer capital. After the fall\nof Sauron, Arnor was safe again for human population, and although it\nremained less populated than Gondor to the south, in time Arnor became a\nmore densely populated area again, even when it had dwindled in size due\nto the independence of the Shire.",

Amrod\nand Amras joined the Laiquendi of Ossiriand, Finrod built Nargothrond\nand Minas Tirith, and Turgon built Gondolin.\n\nFor hundreds of years, the Ñoldor held off the forces of Morgoth,\ndefeating him in three of the major battle of Beleriand and laying siege\nto his great abode in the north.

About seventeen years later\nthey lost a critical battle and many subsequently enslaved.\n\nThe majority of the survivors were forced to relocate farther into the\nsouth with further hurt coming to them by infighting between them caused\nby the Sons of Fëanor. Eventually, all the great realms occupied by the\nexiles fell by the year FA 510 with all survivors fleeing to the Havens\nof Sirion, which had became their chief colony. More conflict assailed\nthem when again the Sons of Fëanor attacked and killed many of their\nkin. One of their residents raised there was Eärendil who built Vingilot\nallowing him to escape the carnage. Joined by his wife, they both won\nthrough to Valinor by the light of the Silmaril. There they pleaded with\nthe Valar for aid and forgiveness for the rebellion of the Ñoldor.\n\nAfter the Morgoth was defeated in the War of Wrath, the Doom was lifted\nand many of the Ñoldorin Exiles went back to the Undying Lands save for\nGaladriel and the Ñoldor who followed Celebrimbor."

Tolkien.\n\nIt follows, and is always published separately from, Part One.\n\n\nContent\n\n_The Book of Lost Tales_ contains the first versions of the stories\nwhich would later become _The Silmarillion_, and is notable because,\nwhile very primitive in style and content, it is very close to the later\nwork in many ways. Each of the Tales is followed by notes and a detailed\ncommentary by Christopher Tolkien.\n\nWhile many of the names in the book are identical or close to those in\nthe later versions, some of them bear almost no resemblance to their\nfinal forms. J.R.R. Tolkien emended names of characters and places\nrather frequently, sometimes with several new variants (rejected in\nturn) written in a single manuscript. Confusingly, sometimes the name\napplied to one thing is later used to refer to a different thing, the\noriginal use abandoned. As an example, the house of Elves called\n“Teleri” in _The Book of Lost Tales_ is not the same as that in _The\nSilmarillion_ (see Teleri). The original usage of “Teleri” would\neventually change until the name became “Vanyar”. Meanwhile, the house\nof Elves called “Solosimpi” would inherit the name “Teleri”.\n\nThe framework for the book is that a mortal Man visits the Isle of Tol\nEressëa, where the Elves live. In the earlier versions of the “Lost\nTales” this man is named Eriol, of some vague north European origin, but\nin later versions he becomes Ælfwine, an Englishman of the Middle-ages.\n\nThere are more changes visible within the book, and it is not internally\nconsistent, partially because even while still writing it Tolkien began\nrewriting earlier parts as his ideas about the world changed. The Tales\nwere eventually abandoned, but they were resurrected in part as the\n“Sketch of the Mythology” which would become _The Silmarillion_.\n\nFor publication the book was split into two volumes: _The Book of Lost\nTales Part One_ and _The Book of Lost Tales Part Two_, but this is\nsimply an editorial division. Both volumes are comprised of several\n“Lost Tales”, which can be considered as either chapters or simply\n“parts”.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1.  “The Tale of Tinúviel” — the first version of the tale of Beren and\n    Lúthien\n2.  “Turambar and the Foalókë” — the first version of the Túrin saga\n3.  “The Fall of Gondolin” — the full narrative of the Fall of Gondolin\n4.  “The Nauglafring” — a story which was “lost” (in that it never was\n    rewritten in full) and mostly excluded from the later\n    _Silmarillion_.\n5.  “The Tale of Eärendel” — the only full narrative of Eärendil's\n    travels\n6.  “The History of Eriol or Ælfwine and the End of the Tales” — an\n    essay about the changes in the framework, and the “unwritten” tales"

    "text": "The FOURTH AGE was the time period that followed the War of the Ring. It\nwas an age of peace, and was also known as the “Age of Men”.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Fourth Age began after Sauron was vanquished and the One Ring was\ndestroyed. The Shire and the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor were restored.\nIt marked the ascent of Men and the final diminishing of the Elves.\nGandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Bilbo and Frodo sailed for the Undying\nLands.\n\nThe allies of Sauron suffered a devastating blow that would take them\ncenturies to recover, if they did at all. Harad was defeated and\nconcluded a peace with King Aragorn II Elessar, by which Umbar, whose\nfleet had been completely destroyed in the mouths of the Anduin, was\nreturned to Gondor, and South Gondor also annexed. The Easterlings also\nsuffered a terrible defeat as their Orc allies fled in terror from the\nBattle of the Black Gate. However, King Elessar, his descendants and\nallies such as King Éomer still on occasion warred with their enemies\nover land, particularly over the bitterly contested region of the Sea of\nRhûn. King Elessar died in FO 120 and was succeeded by his son Eldarion\nwho ruled until about FO 220. Of the kings of the Reunited Kingdom after\nhim, nothing is known.\n\nTolkien said that he thought the distance between the end of the Third\nAge and the 20th century A.D. was about 6000 years, and that 1958 should\nhave been around the end of the Fifth Age if the Fourth and Fifth Ages\nwere about the same length as the Second and Third Ages. He said,\nhowever, in a letter written in 1958 that he believed the Ages had\nquickened and that it was about the end of the Sixth Age or beginning of\nthe Seventh (this letter is referred to in the “Fourth Age” article of\n_The Encyclopedia of Arda,_ as mentioned below)."

    "text": "SINDARIN was the Elvish language most commonly spoken in Middle-earth\nduring in the Third Age - in the real world it is universally referred\nto as, when not in canonical context, “ELVEN” or “ELVISH”.\n\nThe written alphabet of Sindarin, as with Quenya, is typically Tengwar\n(the Feanorian Characters), although Cirth (Runes) can also be used.\n\n\nHistory\n\n It was the language of the Sindar,\nthose Teleri who chose to stay behind on the Great Journey of the Elves.\nIt was derived from an earlier language called “Common Telerin”. When\nthe Ñoldor came back to Middle-earth, they adopted the Sindarin\nlanguage, for the Sindar were more numerous and slower to learn the\nlanguage of Valinor, Quenya the Noldor's native language. Later events\nled to the banning of the use of Quenya within and around Beleriand\nleading to it's eventual use as a high language of law. Before the\ndownfall, most of the Men of Númenor also spoke the language. Knowledge\nof it was kept in the Númenorean realm in exile Gondor, especially among\nthe learned. Dwarves, notably Durin's Folk, used Sindarin when\ncommunicating with Elves. Sindarin is the language referred to as _the\nElven-tongue_ in _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\nTolkien originally imagined that the language which would become\n_Sindarin_ was spoken by the Ñoldor (second clan of Elves). However he\nlater decided that it was the language of the Sindar. For this reason it\nis called _Noldorin_ in the older material, such as the Etymologies.\nWhen Noldorin became Sindarin, it also adopted some features of the\noriginally unrelated language _Ilkorin_. Tolkien based the sound and\nsome of the grammar of his Noldorin/Sindarin on Welsh, and Sindarin\ndisplays of the consonant mutations that characterise the Celtic\n(especially Brythonic) languages. The language was also probably\ninfluenced to an extent by the Germanic languages, as Tolkien was a\nscholar of both Old English and Old Norse.\n\n\nGrammar\n\nSindarin is mainly analytic, though traits of its highly inflected\nprogenitor can still be seen.\n\nPhonology\n\nSindarin was designed to have a Welsh-like phonology. It has most of the\nsame sounds and similar phonotactics.\n\n  -------- ----- -------------------------------------------------------------\n  LETTER   IPA   NOTES\n  a              \n  b              \n  c              \n  ch             The “ch” in the German word “Buch”, not as in “church”\n  d              \n  dh             The “th” in “heather”\n  e              \n  f              Represents  when final or before n,  everywhere else.\n  g              \n  h              \n  hw             \n  i              Represents  when initial,  everywhere else.\n  l              \n  lh       ɬ     The same as the Welsh LL.\n  m              \n  n              \n  ng             Represents  when final,  everywhere else.\n  o              \n  p              \n  ph             Represents  when final,  everywhere else.\n  r              \n  rh             \n  s              \n  t              \n  th             The “th” in “heath”\n  u              \n  v              \n  w              \n  y              Pronounced like German _ü_\n  -------- ----- -------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn accent signifies a long vowel (á, é, etc.). In a monosyllabic word, a\ncircumflex is used (â, ê, etc.). However, for practical reasons, users\nof the ISO Latin-1 character set often substitute ý for ŷ.\n\nDiphthongs are _ai_ (pronounced like AIsle), _ei_ (dAY), _ui_ (tOO\nYoung), _au_ (cOW), and _oi_ (bOY). If the last diphthong finishes a\nword, it is spelt _aw_. There are also diphthongs _ae_ and _oe_ with no\nEnglish counterparts; Tolkien recommended to substitute _ai_ and _oi_\nrespectively if one does not care about details. If one does care, it is\nsimilar to pronouncing _a_ or _o_ respectively in the same syllable as\none pronounces an _e_ (as in pEt).\n\nIn archaic Sindarin, there was a vowel similar to German _ö_ (IPA: ),\nwhich Tolkien mostly transcribed as _œ_ (usually _not_ as _oe_ as is\noften found in publications like the Silmarillion, cf. _Nirnaeth\nArnoediad_ , _Goelydh_ ).\nThis vowel later came to be pronounced and is therefore transcribed as\nsuch .\n\nArchaic Sindarin also had a spirant _m_ or nasal _v_ (IPA: ), which was\ntranscribed as _mh_ (though always pronounced in later Sindarin).\n\nNouns\n\nPluralization\n\nSindarin plurals are characterised by _i-affection_, or _umlaut_. The\nSindarin term for this is _prestanneth_ (disturbance, affection). Almost\nall Sindarin words form their plurals like English man/men and\ngoose/geese — by changing the vowels in the word. The plural patterns\nare:\n\n-   In non-final syllables:\n    -   a > e — galadh > gelaidh\n    -   e > e — bereth > berith\n    -   i > i — dineth > dinith\n    -   o > e — gowest > gewist\n    -   u > y — tulus > tylys\n    -   y > y — (no example available)\n-   In final syllables:\n    -   a > ai — anar > enair\n    -   â > ai — tâl > tail\n    -   e > i — adaneth > edenith\n    -   ê > î — hên > hîn\n    -   i > i — brennil > brennil\n    -   î > î — dîs > dîs\n    -   o > y — brannon > brennyn\n    -   ó > ý — bór > býr\n    -   ô > ý — thôn > thýn\n    -   u > y — urug > yryg\n    -   û > ui — hû > hui\n    -   y > y — ylf > ylf\n    -   ý > ý — mýl > mýl\n    -   au > oe — naug > noeg\n\nNote that _ai_ can sometimes become _î_ (or, less commonly, _ý_).\n\nThe reason for this is that the primitive plural ending _-î_ (still\npresent in Quenya as _-i_) affected the vowels in the word by making\nthem higher and fronter. After this sound change occurred, the suffix\n_-î_ disappeared when all final vowels were lost.\n\nClass Plural\n\nSindarin also has several suffixes which denote a so-called class\nplural. For example, _-ath_ indicates a group of something, e. g.\n_elenath_ from elen (an archaic form of _êl_), meaning _star_ and\n_-ath_. It means _a group of stars_ or _all the stars in the sky_.\nAnother ending, _-rim_, is used to indicate a race, e. g. _nogothrim_\nfrom _nogoth_ — _dwarf_ and _-rim_, meaning _the race of dwarves_. The\nending _-hoth_ is generally used in an unfriendly sense, e. g.\n_gaurhoth_ from _gaur_ — _werewolf_ and _-hoth_, meaning\n_werewolf-host_.\n\nMutation\n\nSindarin has a complex series of mutations. There are three main\ndifferent types of mutations: _soft mutation_ (or lenition), _nasal\nmutation_ and _stop_ (occlusive) _mutation_. Additionally, a _mixed\nmutation_ is also observed after certain particles or prepositions.\nFinally, it is presumed that Sindarin also once had what we could call\nan _archaic spirantal mutation_ (also sometimes called _liquid mutation_\nby scholars). It is still uncertain whether this mutation is still\nproductive or if it only occurs in ancient constructs.\n\nInitial mutations must not be confused with assimilations that may occur\nin compound words (such as, for instance, in the names _Araphor_,\n_Arassuil_ and _Caradhras_).\n\nThe following table outlines how different consonants are affected by\nthe different mutations.\n\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n  BASIC   SOFT   NASAL   MIXED   STOP   LIQUID\n  b       v      m       b       b      v\n  c       g      ch      g       ch     ch\n  d       dh     n       d       d      dh\n  g       '      ng      g       g      '\n  h       ch     ch      h       ch     ch\n  lh      thl    'l      'l      thl    'l\n  m       v      m       m       m      v\n  p       b      ph      b       b      ph\n  rh      thr    'r      'r      thr    'r\n  s       s      s       h       s      s\n  t       d      th      d       th     th\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n\nHere the apostrophe indicates elision.\n\nWords beginning in _b-_, _d-_, or _g-_ which descend from older _mb-_,\n_nd-_, or _ng-_ are affected differently by the mutations:\n\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n  BASIC   SOFT   NASAL   MIXED   STOP   LIQUID\n  b       m      mb      mb      mb     b\n  d       n      nd      nd      nd     d\n  g       ng     g       g       g      g\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n\nTake, for example, the deictic article _i_, which triggers soft\nmutation. When added to a word like _tâl_, it becomes _i dâl_. In\nSindarin's phonological history, _t_ became _d_ in the middle of a word.\nBecause _i tâl_ at the time was considered one word, the _t_ became _d_,\nand thus _i dâl_. However, without the article the word is still _tâl_.\n\nMutation is triggered in various ways:\n\n-   Soft mutation, the most widely occurring mutation, is triggered by\n    the singular article _i_, the prefixes _athra-, ath-, go-, gwa-,\n    ú-,_ and _u-_, as well as the prepositions _ab, am, adel, be, dad,\n    di, na, nu,_ and _î_, and after _avo_. It also affects the second\n    element in a compound, an adjective following a noun, and the object\n    of a verb.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Nasal mutation is triggered by the plural article _in_, and the\n    prepositions _an, dan,_ and plural _'nin_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Mixed mutation is triggered by the genitive article _en_, and the\n    prepositions _ben, erin, nan, 'nin,_ and _uin_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Stop mutation is triggered by the prepositions _ed, ned,_ and\n    _o(d)_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Liquid mutation is presumably triggered by the preposition _or_.\n\nPronouns\n\nPronouns are perhaps the most poorly attested feature of Sindarin. What\nhas been reconstructed by the comparative method is largely conjectural\nand is not agreed upon, and therefore will not be addressed in this\narticle.\n\nSindarin pronouns, like those in English, still maintain some case\ndistinction. Sindarin pronouns have nominative, accusative, genitive,\nand dative forms.\n\n \n\nFirst Person\n\nSecond Person\n\nThird Person\n\n \n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nNominative\n\nim\n\nme\n\nle, ci\n\nle, ci\n\ne, te\n\nti\n\nAccusative\n\nnin\n\nmen\n\nlen, cin\n\nlen, cin\n\nten, den\n\ntin, hain\n\nGenitive\n\n \n\nmín\n\n \n\nlín\n\ndîn\n\n \n\nDative\n\nanim, enni\n\nammen\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEnclitic\n\n-n\n\n-m\n\n-ch\n\n \n\n—\n\n-r\n\nVerbs\n\nSindarin verbs are also quite complex. The number of attested verbs in\nSindarin is small, so the Sindarin verb system is imperfectly known; no\nverb has a full paradigm of forms available. There are two main types of\nverbs: _basic_ and _derived_. Basic verbs have stems which end in a\nconsonant, and derived verbs have stems which incorporate some sort\nderivational morpheme (such as a causative ending) which ends in _-a_.\n\nBasic Verbs\n\nBasic verbs, though smaller in number than derived verbs, have a very\ncomplex conjugation which arises from Sindarin's phonological history.\n\nBasic verbs form the infinitve by adding _-i_: _giri_ from _gir-_. This\nending causes an _a_ or _o_ in the stem to umlaut to _e_: _blebi_ from\n_blab-_. Sindarin does not use infinitive forms very often, and rather\nuses the gerund to achieve the same meaning.\n\nFor all persons except the third person singular, the present tense is\nformed by the insertion of _-i_, and the proper enclitic pronomial\nending: _girin_, _girim_, _girir_. As with the infinitive, _-i_ causes\nan _a_ or _o_ in the stem to umlaut to _e_: _pedin_, _pedim_, _pedir_,\nfrom _pad-_. The third person singular, because it has a zero-ending,\ndoes not require the insertion of _-i_. This leaves the bare stem,\nwhich, because of Sindarin's phonological history, causes the vowel of\nthe stem to become long: _gîr_, _blâb_, _pâd_.\n\nThe past tense of basic verbs is very complicated and poorly attested.\nOne common reconstructed system is to use _-n_: _darn_. However, the\nonly time this _-n_ actually remains is after a stem in _-r_. After a\nstem ending in _-l_, _-n_ becomes _-ll_: _toll_. After _-b, -d, -g, -v,_\nor _-dh_, it is metathesized and then assimilated to the same place of\narticulation as the consonant it now follows. The consonant then\nexperiences what could be called a “backwards mutation”: _-b, -d,_ and\n_-g_ become _-p, -b,_ and _-c_, and _-v_ and _-dh_ become _-m_ and _-d_.\nThe matter is complicated even further when pronomial endings are added.\nBecause _-mp, -mb, -nt, -nd,_ and _-nc_ did not survive medially, they\nbecome _-mm-, -mm-, -nn-, -nn-,_ and _-ng_. In addition, past tense\nstems in _-m_ would have _-mm-_ before any pronomial endings. Because\nthis all may seem rather overwhelming, look at these examples which show\nstep-by-step transformations:\n\n-   _cab-_ > **_cabn_ > **_canb_ > **_camb_ > _camp_, becoming _camm-_\n    with any pronomial endings.\n-   _ped-_ > **_pedn_ > **_pend_ > _pent_, becoming _penn-_ with any\n    pronomial endings.\n-   _dag-_ > **_dagn_ > **_dang_ (_n_ pronounced as in _men_) > **_dang_\n    (_n_ pronounced as in _sing_) > _danc_, becoming _dang-_ with any\n    pronomial endings.\n-   _lav-_ > **_lavn_ > **_lanv_ > **_lanm_ > **_lamm_ > _lam_, becoming\n    _lamm-_ before any pronomial endings.\n-   _redh-_ > **_redhn_ > **_rendh_ > **_rend_ > _rend_, becoming\n    _renn-_ before any pronomial endings.\n\nThe future tense is formed by the addition of _-tha_. An _-i_ is also\ninserted between the stem and _-tha_, which again causes _a_ and _o_ to\numlaut to _e_. Endings for all persons except for the first person\nsingular can be added without any further modification: _giritham_,\n_blebithar_. The first person singular ending _-n_ causes the _-a_ in\n_-tha_ to become _-o_: _girithon_, _blebithon_, _pedithon_.\n\nThe imperative is formed with the addition of _-o_ to the stem: _giro!_,\n_pado!_, _blabo!_.\n\nDerived Verbs\n\nDerived verbs have a much less complex conjugation because they have a\nthematic vowel (usually _a_) which reduces the number of consonant\ncombinations which occur.\n\nThe infinitive is formed with -o, which replaces the -a of the stem, e.\ng. _lacho_ from _lacha-_.\n\nThe present tense is formed without modification to the stem. Pronomial\nendings are added without any change.\n\nThe past tense is formed with the ending _-nt_, which becomes _-nne_\nwith any pronomial endings, e. g. _erthant_, _erthanner_.\n\nThe future tense is formed with _-tha_. With the addition of the first\nperson singular _-n_, this becomes _-tho_.\n\nThe imperative is formed like the infinitive.\n\n\nDialects\n\nDuring the First Age there were several dialects of Sindarin:\n\n-   _Doriathrin_ or the language of Doriath, a form of the language\n    which preserved many archaic forms;\n-   _Falathrin_ or the language of the Falas, later also spoken in\n    Nargothrond;\n-   _North Sindarin_, the dialects originally spoken in Dorthonion and\n    Hithlum by the Sindar, these dialects contained many unique words\n    and were not fully intelligible with the Sindarin of Beleriand\n    proper.\n\nWith the exception of Doriathrin, the dialects were changed under\nÑoldorin influence, and adopted many Quenya features, as well as unique\nsound changes devised by the Ñoldor (who loved changing languages). The\ndistinct dialects disappeared after the Ñoldor and Sindar were dispersed\nduring the later Battles of Beleriand. In the refuges on the Isle of\nBalar and the Mouths of Sirion a new dialect arose under the refugees,\nwhich mainly took after Falathrin. During the Second Age and Third Age\nSindarin was a lingua franca for all Elves and their friends, until it\nwas displaced as the Common tongue by Westron, a descendant of Adûnaic\nwhich was heavily influenced by Sindarin.\n\n_Sindarin_ is actually a Quenya term. The Sindarin word was perhaps\nEDHELLEN (“Elvish”).\n\n\nSample Phrases\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings_\n\n-   _Ai na vedui Dúnadan! Mae govannen!_ - Ah, at last, Westman!

    "text": "MINAS TIRITH  (IPA:\n) was the capital of Gondor in the Third Age and the Fourth Age of\nMiddle-earth. Originally known as MINAS ANOR, the “Tower of the Setting\nSun”, it replaced the city Osgiliath as the new capital and stockade of\nGondor.\n\nWhen the Enemy began to take shape again, Minas Anor was renamed Minas\nTirith, the “Tower of Guard.” The city was also called THE WHITE CITY,\nas the courtyard in the front of the city's Citadel contained the White\nTree. Many important events took place in and in front of the city, such\nas the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the healing of Éowyn by Aragorn\nafter the battle, and the coronation of Aragorn II Elessar.\n\n\nLayout\n\nMinas Tirith was surrounded by the Rammas Echor, a large ringwall\nencircling the city and the Pelennor Fields. This wall was built after\nMinas Ithil fell and was renamed Minas Morgul. It was repaired by\nEcthelion II during the time of the War of the Ring, but it had not the\nstrength to defend the city from the Dark Lord Sauron's legions of\nUruk-hai from Mordor. The city itself lay on a hill beneath Mount\nMindolluin, which rose above the city's citadel, by a length of a couple\nof thousand feet. Mount Mindolluin was where Aragorn found the seedling\nof the White Tree. \n\nThe city was divided into seven one-hundred-foot high levels, each\nsurrounded by white walls, except the first walls which had the same\nkind of black stone as Orthanc as a face. The gates connecting the\nlevels did not lay behind one another in a line, but faced in different\ndirections. A spur of rock, whose summit was level with the city's\nuppermost tier, jutted out from the front of the city in an easterly\ndirection, dividing all but the first level into two. Each level was\nscattered with many alleys, narrow passageways, and full-fledged houses\n(which were probably quite rare in the city). On the sixth level were\nlocated the Houses of Healing, surrounded by pleasant gardens. Finally,\nwithin the seventh wall, was the Citadel of Minas Tirith, with the White\nTower of Ecthelion - three hundred feet high, so that its apex was one\nthousand feet above the plain.\n\nLevels\n\n\n\nThe First Level of Minas Tirith was the lowest level of Minas Tirith\nwhere was the Main gate.\n\nDuring the Siege of Minas Tirith, Uruk-hai cast fire into the First\nLevel, burning many buildings and causing general havoc to many of the\ndefenders. Later on, the Main Gate was breached when Grond was finally\nused against it, and the soldiers of Gondor and Uruk-hai clashed in the\nstreets of the First Circle but Aragorn ordered a retreat and then made\ntheir way up.\n\n\nHistory\n\nMinas Tirith (as Minas Anor) was built in SA 3320. King Ostoher rebuilt\nthe city in TA 420, and, gradually, it became more important than\nOsgiliath, the original capital, which in later years fell into ruin.\nKing Tarondor finally moved the King's House to the city in TA 1640,\nthereby making it the official capital of the kingdom of Gondor. In the\nyear TA 2002, the White City's companion tower Minas Ithil (the “Tower\nof the Moon”) on the borders of Mordor was captured by the Ringwraiths\nand renamed Minas Morgul (the “Tower of Sorcery”). Minas Anor was then\nrenamed Minas Tirith, meaning the “Tower of Guard”, to indicate that,\nsince the fall of Minas Ithil, Minas Tirith was the only thing that\ndefended Gondor and all the other lands around and behind it against the\ndarkness from Mordor. The Rammas Echor, the great wall encircling the\nrich farmlands and suburbs of the City, was built at this time.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nMinas Tirith only has Gondorian soldiers while the civilians dwell in\nOsgiliath with several Gondorian soldiers. After the Uruk-hai attacked\nand overran Osgiliath a thousand soldiers were killed while the\nremaining thousand soldiers fled to Minas Tirith while the civilians\nwere evacuated to Rohan. The remaining gondorian soldiers entered\nOsgiliath and once the uruk-hai were slain the civilians departed from\nRohan and returned to Osgiliath.\n\nSiege of Minas Tirith\n\nMinas Tirith was besieged by the armies of Mordor, under the Great\nDarkness generated by Sauron's power. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields\ntook place on March 15, 3019 in the fields surrounding the city. It was\na very large battle. Theoden, the King of Rohan was killed during this\nbattle by the Witch-king of Angmar. At about the same time, the\nWitch-king was destroyed by Éowyn, lady of Rohan, who was severely\nwounded in the process. It was also there that Gandalf took command of\nthe City's defenses from the Ruling Steward Denethor after he fell to\ndespair. Aragorn later arrived at the hour of need with Gondor's Army of\nthe South which he had liberated from defending the port city of\nPelargir, turning the tide of battle in favor of the Free Peoples. After\nthe battle, the stench of death was heavy in Minas Tirith's air, and the\nPelennor Fields lay strewn with bodies.\n\nFourth Age\n\nOn 1 May 3019, the Crowning of King Elessar took place on the plain\noutside Minas Tirith. After his coronation, he entered the city as the\nKing of Gondor, as he was destined to become from the start of his\nlifetime. With his coronation, King Elessar refounded the line of the\nKings of Gondor, and as he was also the King of the Kingdom of Arnor,\nMinas Tirith became Capital of the Reunited Kingdom.\n\nMinas Tirith was repaired by its new king (who grew plants inside of its\nwalls to add to its luster and beauty) and by the Dwarves of Glittering\nCaves, particularly Gimli, who built a new gate for the city (made of\nmithril and steel) and altogether fixed the layout of the city as well.\nMinas Tirith was said to have been made even more beautiful than when it\nwas at the time of its founding. The city is known to have stood firm\nand strong well into the Fourth Age because of these two renovations.\n\nIn _The Silmarillion_, as Of The Ring Of Power And The Third Age says,\nafter War of the Ring, the city is referred to as Minas Anor again after\nthe overthrow of Sauron and the destruction of Barad-dûr.\n",

    "text": "ERIADOR was a large region situated in northwestern Middle-earth. It was\nlocated between the Blue Mountains (to the west) and the Misty Mountains\n(to the east).\n\n\nDescription and Climate\n\nAccording to _The Atlas of Middle-earth_, Eriador was about six-hundred\nmiles (approximately 965.5 kilometers) from east to west. It was\nmostly lowlands. Hill areas were mainly in around the realms of Arnor,\nthe Shire in the center of the region and in the far eastern parts near\nthe Misty Mountains. Plains and bottomlands were in the south and\nsouthwestern parts. A plateau area existed in the area where Rivendell\nand the Trollshaws were located. Eriador was largely made up of\nscattered woodlands with scrublands in the north and northeastern parts.\nThe rest were short grasslands mainly in the center of the region.\n\nThe climate was mainly humid with relatively mild to cold winters with a\nconstantly warm and moist prevailing wind blowing over the Blue\nMountains. In the northern part, cold and dry prevailing winds blow down\nfrom the polar north influencing the climate as well.\n\nMost of the population was concentrated in the center area around Arnor\nand the Shire and the dominant language was Westron at least by the\nThird Age.\n\nIts boundaries were:\n\n-   To the east, the Misty Mountains.\n-   To the north, the Ice-Bay of Forochel, which flooded part of the\n    lands of Morgoth after the War of Wrath.\n-   To the west, the Blue Mountains.\n-   To the south, the river Greyflood and the land of Enedwaith. After\n    the War of Wrath, part of the southwestern border lies along the\n    shores of Belegaer.\n\nImportant rivers were the Lune (Elvish _Lhûn_), the Brandywine or\n_Baranduin_ in Elvish and the Greyflood.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the Second Age, and possibly much earlier, it was largely forested,\nbut Men cleared the land for farming and the massive old forests never\nrecovered. Much of it was encompassed in the early Third Age by the\nkingdom of Arnor, which later split into the rival kingdoms of Rhudaur,\nArthedain and Cardolan. The Shire occupies part of the former Kingdom of\nArthedain, while Bree and its neighbouring villages lie on the border\nwith the former Cardolan. The Barrow-wights dwell within ancient burial\nmounds constructed in the First Age by the Edain as they journeyed to\nBeleriand. Other important places in Eriador are Rivendell and the\nabandoned kingdoms of Eregion and Angmar.\n\nAt the beginning of the Second Age, large populations of both regular\nMen and Dúnedain inhabited the region. There was also a group of\nNoldorin exiles living in Eregion, near Moria and also located in the\nwestern most region of Eriador (and also in Middle-earth) was the High\nElven Kingdom of Lindon, once the greatest and mightiest kingdom of\nMiddle earth. Sauron's assault on the Elves of Eregion laid waste to\nthat land, and many of the Elves of the Lindon fell in the War of the\nLast Alliance.\n\nEven after his fall, Sauron's evil spirit acted through his agents, such\nas the Witch-king of Angmar, and he also concocted virulent plagues\nwhich swept over the land. Between warfare against the surviving\nDúnedain kingdoms, the plagues, and the general lawlessness sweeping\nover the land, the population dropped considerably. The Angmar War\nturned Eriador into a beautiful, but mostly wild and untamed land, and\nthe only concentration of Elves was either in the valley of Rivendell or\nLindon.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ERIADOR_ is a Sindarin word that meant 'Lonely land' or\n'Lone-lands'.",

    "page_id": "163",
    "text": "GONDOR was the prominent kingdom of Men in Middle-earth, bordered by\nRohan to the north, Harad to the south, the cape of Andrast and the Sea\nto the west, and Mordor to the east. Its first capital was Osgiliath,\nmoved to Minas Tirith in TA 1640. The city of Minas Tirith remained the\ncapital of Gondor for the rest of the Third Age and into years of the\nFourth Age; other major fortresses include Dol Amroth in Belfalas and\nOsgiliath, which was a city on the Anduin.\n\nGondor was founded by the brothers Isildur and Anárion, exiles from\nNúmenor. Gondor was an allied kingdom with Arnor, whose line of king\nchieftains came from Isildur, while the Line of the Kings of Gondor was\nfrom Anárion. Gondor was at the height of its power in its early years\ndue to the ships and the military might that its armies possessed.\nHowever, continued attacks by allies of Sauron, civil war, and a\ndevastating plague caused it to gradually decline over the course of the\nThird Age until Sauron's final defeat and the crowning of Aragorn II\nElessar. Following that time the power of Gondor once again expanded,\nuntil the former lands of Arnor were brought under the banner of the\nReunited Kingdom. \n\nIn all, there were thirty-one kings of Gondor after Anárion, who was\nslain before Barad-dûr at the Siege of Barad-dûr. \n\n\nHistory\n\nLike Arnor to the north, Gondor was a Mannish kingdom founded by\nAnárion, the youngest son of Elendil, after the Downfall of Númenor. It\nwas located to the South of Rohan and to the West of Mordor, on the Bay\nof Belfalas.\n\nEarly years\n\n Before the Downfall of Númenor,\nGondor was home to many Númenórean colonists, who either mixed blood\nwith the indigenous Middle Men if they were friendly, or dispersed them\ninto Ras Morthil, Dunland, and Drúadan Forest. Gondor, at a latitude\ncomparable to Venice, was a more fertile region than Arnor to the north,\nand therefore it already had a larger population before the ships of\nElendil's sons arrived, including a well-established city, Pelargir.\n\nThe Faithful or Elendili from Númenor were given a warm reception upon\ntheir arrival by those that had already colonized Middle-earth,\nincluding a colonial branch of Númenorean royalty at Dor-en-Ernil. The\ncolonists north of Anduin accepted Elendil's claim to kingship over\nthem. South of the Great River, however, the newly exiled Númenoreans\ndid not recognize Elendil's claim.\n\nGondor was being founded after Númenor's population had already split\nbetween The Faithful and King's Men, and all of the more southern\ncolonies (such as Umbar) remained enemies of The Faithful.\n\nThe newly founded kingdom of Gondor was then part of the Last Alliance\nof Elves and Men which overthrew Sauron for the first time at the very\nend of the Second Age, and when Isildur cut the finger of Sauron.\n\nGondor Prospers\n\nAfter the war, Gondor's power and wealth grew steadily (only interrupted\nby an Easterling invasion in TA 492). Its power would continue to grow\ninto the 9th century Third Age. While the power of Gondor's sister\nkingdom Arnor peaked during the 9th century, when it broke into various\nsuccessor states, Gondor's greatest glory was yet to come. Gondor's\ngreat cities Minas Anor, Minas Ithil, Osgiliath and Pelargir only grew\nand the Dunedain of Gondor started to rule over more and more of the\nlesser people.\n\nGondor's Golden Age\n\n\n\nGondor's power reached its Golden Age under the four “Ship-kings”:\n\n-   Tarannon Falastur r. TA 830 – TA 913. First of the Ship-Kings, died\n    childless\n-   Eärnil I r. TA 913 – TA 936. Nephew of Tarannon\n-   Ciryandil r. TA 936 – TA 1015\n-   Hyarmendacil I (Ciryaher) r. TA 1015 - TA 1149. Last of the\n    Ship-Kings. In the reign of the powerful king, Hyarmendacil I (c.\n    12th century TA) Gondor reached the height of its power. During\n    Hyarmendacil's reign, Gondor's borders reached their furthest\n    extent. The Kingdom extended east to the Sea of Rhûn, south to the\n    nearest lands of the Haradrim, as far north as Mirkwood, and west\n    towards the borders of Arnor.\n\nSuch was Gondor's wealth during the period that men from other lands\nwould say in envy: “In Gondor precious stones are but pebbles for the\nchildren to play with.” Gondor would also enjoy several centuries of\npeace due to its military might.\n\n\n\nThe Decline of Gondor\n\nHowever, after decadence spread under the Kings of Gondor and a long\nperiod of decline began (although Gondor experienced several revivals).\nThree great calamities struck Gondor during the second millennium of the\nThird Age, which are held to be the chief reasons for its decline: the\nKin-strife, the Great Plague, and the invasion of the Wainriders (a\ntribe of Easterlings).\n\nThe Kin-strife\n\nIn the 15th century TA a great civil war named the Kin-strife tore the\nnation apart. The current King Eldacar was of mixed blood: his mother\nwas of the Northmen. Popular displeasure at this led to the overthrow of\nKing Eldacar by Castamir, the admiral of all of Gondor's naval forces\nwho possessed some royal blood. Eldacar's son was slain, and he fled\nnorth. Castamir was afterwards known as Castamir the Usurper. During his\nten-year rule, he proved to be very cruel, and because of his love of\nhis old fleet, he lavished attention on the coastal regions while the\ninterior provinces were ignored and left to rot. Eldacar then returned\nwith an army of his Northman kinsmen, and the armies of the Men of\nGondor joined them from interior provinces such as Anórien. Osgiliath\nwas devastated during this conflict, its great bridge destroyed and its\n_Palantír_ lost. Eldacar slew Castamir and reclaimed his throne, but\nCastamir's sons and their forces were besieged in Pelargir, the great\nport of Gondor. They eventually retreated to Umbar, where they joined\nwith the Corsairs, and troubled Gondor for many years, until their\ndescendants died out.\n\nThe Great Plague\n\nLater, the Great Plague struck and the White Tree died. This Plague was\nno localized event: the Plague swept through all of Middle-earth,\nreaching the successor states of Arnor and the Hobbits of the Shire in\nthe North. King Tarondor found a sapling of the White Tree, and moved\nthe capital from Osgiliath to Minas Anor, the City of Anárion. During\nthis time, Gondor was so depopulated that the fortifications guarding\nagainst the re-entry of evil into Mordor were abandoned. It is believed\nthat had the Haradrim or Easterlings been capable of attacking Gondor at\nthis time, it would have fallen. However, the Plague left Gondor's\nenemies in no better condition than Gondor itself, and neither side was\ncapable of mounting new offensives.\n\nThe Invasion of the Wainriders\n\nFollowing the sapping of Gondor's strength by the plague, it did recover\nbut then the Wainrider (Easterlings) invaded and devastated Gondor, and\nthe conflict lasted for almost a century. The Wainriders destroyed the\nNorthern Army of Gondor, but survivors linked up with the victorious\nSouthern Army of Gondor which destroyed the Haradrim as they crossed the\nriver Poros, led by a general named Eärnil, and they destroyed the\nWainriders as they celebrated their victory during the Battle of the\nCamp.\n\nThe Line of the Kings Fails\n\nReunification Rejected\n\nIn TA 1944 Gondor faced a succession crisis when King Ondoher was slain\nin battle with both his sons. Arvedui, Prince of Arthedain, Ondoher's\nson-in-law, and the victorious general Eärnil, who was a distant\nblood-relative of Ondoher, claimed the throne. Arvedui's claim lay\nmainly in the reintroduction of the old Nùmenorean law of accession,\nwhich stated the eldest (remaining) child should succeed the king. If\nthe law was reintroduced, then Arvedui's wife Fíriel, Ondoher's daughter\nand last remaining child, would become Ruling-Queen, making their\ndescendants Kings of both Arnor and Gondor. Arvedui also tried to put\nweight behind his claim, as he was Isildur's heir. The council of Gondor\nrecognised that the name of Isildur was held in honour in Gondor, but\nthey dictated that the South-Kingdom must be ruled by an Heir of\nAnarion. Due to his ancestry from Fíriel and Arvedui, more than a\nmillennium later, Aragorn Elessar put forward his claim as the heir of\nboth Isildur and Anarion.\n\nEärnil laid his claim as being a direct descendant of King Telumehtar\nUmbardacil. His claim was also greatly bolstered by the popularity he\nhad gained as the victorious general who saved Gondor from the\nWainriders after winning the southern theatre of the war. Steward\nPelendur who was temporarily ruling Gondor as serving as arbiter of\nsuccession, intervened in favour of Gondor's victorious general who\nwould rule as Eärnil II.\n\nThe Last Heir of Anárion\n\nDuring the Battle of Fornost, Eärnil II's heir Eärnur led Gondor's\nforces to victory over the Witch-king of Angmar, who was actually the\nLord of the Nazgûl. Although Eärnur wished to fight him, Eärnur's horse\nwas terrified and fled the battle against his wishes. By the time, he\nmastered his horse and returned the Witch-king had fled. Glorfindel the\nElf then prophesied to him that it was better that he not fight the Lord\nof the Nazgûl because “never by the hand of man shall he fall”.\n\nEärnur later ascended to the throne, ruling from Minas Anor (“Tower of\nthe Sun”). During this time, the Ringwraiths captured the city of Minas\nIthil (“Tower of the Moon”), renaming it _Minas Morgul_ (“Tower of Dark\nSorcery”) and taking it as their lair. Minas Anor was renamed _Minas\nTirith_ (Tower of Guard) as a result. The Lord of the Nazgûl repeatedly\nsent messengers to Minas Tirith challenging Eärnur to single combat,\ntaunting him that he had fled out of cowardice from facing him during\nthe Battle of Fornost. Eventually, King Eärnur was overcome by wrath and\nrode with a small company of knights to Minas Morgul, to accept the\nchallenge. They were never heard from again; and so ended the Line of\nAnárion.\n\nThe Stewards of Gondor\n\nThe Ruling Stewards\n\nA long line of hereditary Stewards governed the realm after the\ndisappearance of Eärnur, son of Eärnil, since there was no proof that\nthe last king was dead, and no claimant had enough support to be\naccepted as his successor. The line of Anárion was held to have failed,\nand Gondor was not willing to risk to another Kin-strife, which would\nsurely have destroyed it. Whenever there was a new Steward, he would\nswear an oath to yield rule of Gondor back to the King, in essence only\nan heir of Isildur, if he should ever return. In Gondor, there was no\none who could claim descent from Isildur in direct line, and the\nnorthern line of Arnor had effectively disappeared, so this oath was not\nconsidered seriously. The line of Stewards ruled as Kings, without\nhaving the title. During the War of the Ring, the ruling Steward of\nGondor was Denethor II, and his two sons were Boromir and younger\nFaramir- the latter being the last Ruling Steward of Gondor.\n\nCirion and Eorl\n\nIn TA 2510 when Steward Cirion ruled over Gondor, the nation faced one\nof its greatest perils: an Easterling tribe named the _Balchoth_ invaded\nGondor with mass force. Gondor's army marched to fight the Balchoth but\nwere cut off from Minas Tirith and pushed back in the direction of the\nLimlight.\n\nMessengers were sent to get help from the Éothéod, a tribe, which lived\nin the northern vales of the Anduin, but nobody expected the messengers\nto reach their destination. When certain peril came upon Gondor,\nhowever, the Éothéod turned the tide of the Battle of the Field of\nCelebrant. After the victory the Éothéod were awarded the fields of\nCalenardhon north of the White Mountains from the Gap of Rohan at the\nsouthern end of the Hithaeglir, Fangorn forest, rivers Limlight to\nAnduin, western Emyn Muil, and the Mering Stream, where they established\nthe kingdom of Rohan with Eorl the Young as their first king. A\npermanent alliance between Gondor and Rohan was established by the oath\nEorl swore to Cirion.\n\nThe War of the Ring and the Restoration\n\nSeveral centuries later, Sauron had prepared for the final conquest, and\nin TA 3018 his forces overran Ithilien. The attack was stopped at\nOsgiliath with the destruction of the bridge across the Anduin. The\nfollowing year Minas Tirith faced a larger attack from Mordor, with\nadditional threat from the Corsairs of Umbar. Aragorn summoned the Dead\nMen of Dunharrow to destroy the forces from Umbar, freeing forces in the\nsouth of Gondor to come to the aid of Minas Tirith. Gondor then defeated\nthe army of Mordor with the aid of the Rohirrim in the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields, though with heavy losses. The combined army of the West\nthen carried the battle to Sauron at the Battle of the Morannon, a feint\nto distract Sauron's attention from Frodo Baggins's quest to destroy the\nOne Ring in Mount Doom, thus causing Sauron's destruction and the\nallies' ultimate victory.\n\nAfter the second and final defeat of Sauron, the Kingship was restored,\nwith Aragorn crowned as King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor\nand Gondor. Faramir, last heir of the Ruling Stewards, retained his\noffice as the Steward to the King, and ruled over Gondor's eastern\nregion of Ithilien; a fair land between the river Anduin and the Ephel\nDúath. The oaths between Gondor and Rohan were renewed, and several\njoint campaigns were fought in the east and south against the remnant of\nthe Easterlings and Haradrim; all former territories of the\nSouth-kingdom were won back during the following centuries, and its\npower and wealth were restored. Several Tolkien's writings state that\n_“...of Eldarion son of Elessar it was foretold that he should rule a\ngreat realm, and that it should endure for a hundred generations of men\nafter him, that is until a new age brought in again new things; and from\nhim should come the kings of many realms in long days after”_.\n\n\nArmies\n\nSecond Age\n\nThe soldiers of Gondor were renowned during the Second Age for their\nskill and valour. Training men of Gondor during the Second Age instilled\nwithin their soldiers a martial spirit and ardor, goading them to fight\nto the death against the hordes of Mordor, Rhûn, and Harad. Every man\nwas physically imposing: being very tall at over six feet, very broad,\nand very strong as well. Every single soldier was in peak fighting\ncondition and ready to fight against Sauron's hordes (especially during\nthe War of the Last Alliance). The three major weapons they used were\nspears, longswords, and longbows. They also knew how to form cohesive\nbox-formations, which were sturdy enough for both offensive and\ndefensive purposes. The soldiers wore heavy plate armour and utilised\nlarge shields made out of multi-layered wood and edged in metal for\nreinforcement.\n\nThird Age\n\nGondor's armies prevented Mordor and its allies from overwhelming the\nrest of Middle-earth. Gondor was in a very crucial position, in order to\nguard Middle Earth and because of Gondor's proximity to Mordor, its\nmilitary forces had to be proficiently trained and vigilantly on guard\nat all times. Because of this, they were arguably the strongest country\nthat opposed Sauron. During the Third Age, most of Minas Tirith's armies\nwere trained and drilled to fight in tight infantry formations,\nsupported by archers and cavalry. Their armaments consisted of a\nchainmail undercoat with either a black tabard or plate armor over it.\nTheir standard weapons were long spears, longswords, and longbows,\ncomplimented by tower shields. \n\nMinas Tirith's immediate defenses comprised thousands of infantrymen\nstationed throughout Osgiliath, Cair Andros, and the Rammas Echor. These\nunits were most likely temporary detachments from the city. Minas Tirith\nalso had at least three companies of the elite Guards of the Citadel,\ntasked to defend the upper levels of the city. They wore black robes,\nsurcoats and winged silver crowns. The Guards of the City were not\nallowed to go in the main part of the City in their uniform.\nAdditionally, the sixth level of the city housed stables for a small\nforce of horsemen. Beyond Anduin and the defenses of Minas Tirith\noperated a secretive group of soldiers called the Rangers of Ithilien\nThe Rangers of Ithilien had guerrilla warfare aginst the Southrons,\nallies of Mordor. Similar to the Rangers of the North, the Rangers of\nIthilien were comprised of the remnant of the Dúnedain in their\nrespective Kingdom, in this case being the Dúnedain that once dwelled in\nIthilien.(the Rangers of the North were Arnorian Dúnedain, while the\nRangers of Ithilien are Gondorian- and were more populous than their\nnorthern kin).  Armed with longbows, swords, and spears, these men\nwatched and harassed the enemy throughout Ithilien, much akin to\nguerrilla warfare. The captain of the Rangers of Ithilien during the War\nof the Ring was Faramir, the younger brother of Boromir and the son of\nthe Steward of Gondor, Denethor II.\n\nThe defense of Gondor's fiefdoms were the responsibility of the\nrespective lords of these territories. Their training, strength in\nnumbers, and armaments varied from each fief (Lossarnach brought axemen\nto the aid of Minas Tirith while the men of Morthond Vale consisted of\narchers). The greatest of these fiefs was Dol Amroth, which brought\nforth the largest force to Minas Tirith, made up of men-at-arms and\narguably the best cavalry in Middle Earth- the elite Swan Knights.\n\nGondor's fleet at the time of the War of the Ring was docked at\nPelargir. This port and the Anduin River was essential in the defense of\nMinas Tirith. As made evident by the fiefdom's dire need to defend their\ncoasts and many rivers of Gondor, a majority of the fleet was\nconcentrated at Pelargir. This fleet was destroyed when the Black Ships\nof Umbar attacked, enslaving many of Gondor's sailors into the service\nof Mordor.\n\n\nSong of Gondor\n\n_Gondor! Gondor, between the Mountains and the Sea!_\n\n_West Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver Tree_\n\n_Fell like bright rain in gardens of the Kings of old._\n\n_O proud walls! White towers! O wingéd crown and throne of gold!_\n\n''O Gondor, Gondor! Shall Men behold the Silver Tree, ''\n\n_Or West Wind blow again between the Mountains and the Sea?_\n\nThis was sung by Aragorn on his trip with Legolas and Gimli to find\nPippin and Merry.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Gondor_ name means 'Land of Stone', from Sindarin GOND (stone) + (N)DOR\n(land), most likely given to it because of the White Mountains (Ered\nNimrais) and other mountain chains in the land (hypothetical Quenya name\nONDONÓRË).\n\n\nRegions of Gondor\n\n  Gondor was divided between several nearly\nautonomous regions. These were the following:\n\n-   Ithilien, a region along the east bank of the Anduin river under the\n    shadow of the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow). Ithilien was\n    abandoned and mostly under the control of Mordor during The War of\n    the Ring. (Although Gondor did have secret bases throughout the\n    region such as Henneth Annûn, and the Rangers of Ithilien used\n    guerilla warfare tactics to harass the enemy throughout Ithilien,\n    and disrupt supply lines and companies marching to and from Mordor.\n    After the War of the Ring, Faramir was made Lord Paramount of\n    Ithilien by Aragorn.\n-   South Ithilien, a portion of the the Ithilien south of Osgiliath.\n    The road (the Harad Road) the Southrons took to get to Morder lied\n    here.\n-   Anórien, a strip of land along the northern edge of the White\n    Mountains. Bordered by the Mering Stream and Rohan to the west,\n    Anduin to the east, the Mouths of Entwash to to the north, and\n    theWhite Mountainsand Rammas Echor to the south.\n-   Lossarnach, a heavily-populated farmland region southwest of Minas\n    Tirith.\n-   Lebennin, a plain extending from the White Mountains down to the Bay\n    of Belfalas that bordered Lossarnach.\n-   Belfalas, a fiefdom ruled by the Princes of Dol Amroth.\n-   Dor-en-Ernil, a narrow strip of land along the Bay of Belfalas ruled\n    by the Princes of Dol Amroth.\n-   Lamedon, a plain between the White Mountains and the River Ringló.\n-   Anfalas or _Langstrand_, a narrow strip of land along the sea\n    bordered by the Pinnath Gelin.\n-   Andrast, The western-most province of Gondor located on a narrow\n    peninsula jutting out into the Sea.\n-   Ringló Vale, a mini-province.\n-   Morthond or Blackroot Vale, where Duilin comes from.\n\nThe long cape of Andrast was not populated (by the descendants of\nNúmenóreans, but evidence from the _Unfinished Tales_ suggests that a\nsmall group of Púkel-men inhabited it.)\n\nAdditionally, Gondor held or had held the following regions at certain\npoints in its history:\n\n-   South Gondor or Harondor, an arid region between the rivers Porosand\n    Harnen, which was contested between Gondor and Harad.\n-   Calenardhon, which was given to the Éothéod and became Rohan. It's\n    boundaries were the rivers of Anduin in the east, Isenin the west,\n    Limlightin the north, and the White Mountains/ Mering Stream in the\n    south.\n-   Enedwaith, a region between the rivers Isen and Greyflood. It was\n    never truly populated by Gondor and was soon abandoned.\n-   Rhovanion, which was never fully under the control of Gondor but\n    under Gondorian control at certain times during the Third Age.\n-   Ephel Dúath, the Mountains of Shadow, which was the extreme eastern\n    region of Gondor where she kept watch over Mordor with many\n    fortresses and cities such as Minas Ithil, Durthang, and the Tower\n    of Cirith Ungol. Evil things re-entered Mordor after Gondor's watch\n    upon the land slackened during the Second Age.\n\n\nMajor Sites\n\n Cities, Fortresses, and Strongholds in Gondor included:\n\n-   Cair Andros, an island-fortress in the river Anduin, roughly 40\n    miles north of Osgiliath. Gondor maintained a steady garrison here,\n    as it was of paramount importance to Gondor during the long war with\n    Mordor, in order to prevent the enemy from crossing the river and\n    entering into Anórien.\n\n\n\n-   Calembel, a city in Lamedon.\n-   Dol Amroth, a city in Belfalas ruled by the Prince of Dol Amroth.\n-   Ethring, a ford and a large township built on either side of the\n    river Ringló.\n-   Henneth Annûn, a hidden refuge of Gondorian rangers in the northern\n    part of Ithilien along the Ephel Duath, the Mountains of Shadow.\n-   Linhir, a port city in Lebennin.\n-   Minas Tirith (originally Minas Anor), City of the Kings, the capital\n    (Third Age) and largest city of Gondor.\n-   Osgiliath, a city and former capital of Gondor on the river Anduin,\n    largely destroyed and abandoned by the end of the Third Age. During\n    the War of the Ring, Gondor kept a garrison on the west bank to\n    prevent the Enemy from crossing the river and assaulting Minas\n    Tirith. Osigiliath was the key to besiege Minas Tirith because of\n    its location and access to the river. Although the massive\n    Morgul-host led by the Witch-King to beseige Minas Tirith\n    overwhelmed the garrison, and drove the Gondorians out thus gaining\n    the passage of Anduin- the true beginning of the Siege of Gondor\n    that would conclude at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. King\n    Elessar had it rebuilt after Sauron's downfall.\n-   Pelargir, the great southern harbour, which was captured by the\n    Corsairs during the War of the Ring. The people of Pelargir helped\n    in the Batttle of Pell\n-   Tarnost, a hill-town in Belfalas.\n\nAdditionally, Gondor had held the following locations at certain points\nin its history:\n\n-   Angrenost (Isengard), one of the three Fortresses of Gondor and held\n    within it one of the realm's Palantiri. Its location in Nan\n    Curunir (valley at the end of the Misty Mountains), was at the\n    northwestern corner of the Southern Kingdom of Gondor, guarding the\n    Fords of Isen from enemy incursions into Calenardhon, and together\n    with the fortress of Helm's Deep to its south protected the Gap of\n    Rohan. After Calenardhon was given to the Éothéod by Cirion, Steward\n    of Gondor and became Rohan, Isengard remained part of Gondor, and\n    the company of Aglarond removed to the northern fortress, although\n    the rest of Gondor almost forgot about it. The small guard\n    intermarried much with the Dunlendings , until the place became a\n    Dunlending fortress in all but name. Orthanc, however, remained\n    closed, as the Steward of Gondor still held the keys. Isengard soon\n    came all but deserted.\n-   Durthang, the largest fortress in Mordor, originally built to guard\n    the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow)..\n-   Erech, a town of Gondor that was abandoned by the end of the Third\n    Age. To the north lay the Paths of the Dead.\n-   Minas Ithil, a city founded by Isildur that was originally the\n    sister city of Minas Anor. Located in an upland valley at the feet\n    of the Mountains of Shadow, it was built as a fortress city to\n    defend Gondor from Sauron in Mordor. It was later conquered by\n    the Nazgûl and renamed Minas Morgul.\n-   Tharbad, a city on both sides of the river Greyflood, (at one time\n    held by Gondor in the south and Arnor in the north) but abandoned as\n    Gondor's borders recessed through Enedwaith to the Isen, and later\n    ruined.\n-   Tower of Cirith Ungol, a Tower Fortress in western Mordor built by\n    Gondor to guard the pass of Cirith Ungol from any evil creature\n    trying to enter -or leave- Mordor. The Great Plague wiped out the\n    garrison located here, so it was easily captured when Sauron's\n    minions re-entered Mordor.\n-   Towers of the Teeth, two towers situated on either side of the Black\n    Gate. The two towers, called Carchost and Narchost, that stand on\n    either side of Cirith Gorgor, the Haunted Pass, which lies between\n    the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow), and the Ash\n    Mountains. Originally built by Men of Gondor following the downfall\n    of Sauron at the end of the Second Age, the Towers of the Teeth were\n    eventually taken over by the servants of the Dark Lord. They were\n    then repaired and fortified and were incorporated into the defenses\n    of the pass and gate.\n-   Umbar, the far southern harbour which was lost and reclaimed several\n    times, in the end being the home of Black Númenóreans, the Corsairs\n    of Umbar.\n",

    "text": "VALINOR (Quenya; IPA: ; also\nVALINÓRË; ; meaning _Land of the Valar_), the Land_' across the Sea_',\nwas the realm of the Valar in Aman; the place to which they migrated\nafter being driven from Almaren by Melkor in times before the First Age.\nIt was also known as the Undying Lands as only immortal souls were\nallowed to reside there, with some exceptions when it came to the\nbearers of the One Ring; and additionally, even Gimli, who accompanied\nhis friend Legolas to these lands.\n\n\nLay of the land\n\nIts major city was Valmar, where the Vanyar and the Valar resided. Two\nother cities were Alqualondë and Tirion, the respective homes of the\nTeleri and the Noldor. It also had an island, Tol Eressëa, just off its\neast coast.\n\nValinor as explained was the home of the Valar, the Powers of\nMiddle-earth. The sea to the west of the island was called Ekkaia, or\nthe Encircling Sea; it surrounded both Valinor and Middle-earth.\n\nEach of the Valar had their own region of the land where they resided\nand altered things to their desire. Yavanna, the Vala of nature, growth,\nand harvest, resided in the Pastures of Yavanna in the south of the\nisland. Orome, the Vala of the hunt, lived in the Woods of Orome to the\nnorth-east of the pastures. The forest was home to many creatures which\nOrome could track and hunt. Nienna, the lonely Vala of sorrow and\nendurance lived cut off in the far west of the island in the Halls of\nNienna where she spent her days crying, looking out to sea. Just south\nof the Halls of Nienna and to the north of the pastures there were the\nHalls of Mandos. Mandos, the brother of Nienna, was the Vala of the\nafterlife. All inhabitants of Middle-earth went to the Halls of Mandos\nshould they happen to die, mortals and immortals alike (immortals could\nbe killed although they did not die of old age) although it was said\nthat in death as in life, they were separated. Also living in the Halls\nof Mandos was his spouse Vairë the weaver, who wove the threads of time.\n\nTo the east of the Halls of Mandos was the Isle of Estë, which was\nsituated in the middle of the lake of Lorellin which in turn was\nsituated to the north of the Gardens of Lórien (not to be confused with\nLothlórien in Middle-earth which was created by the same Valar, Lórien\nalso known as Irmo, the Vala of dreams). Este and Lórien being husband\nand wife lived close together. To the north of this were the Mansions of\nAule the smith Valar who was spouse to Yavanna. In the north-east lay\nthe Mansions of Manwe and Varda, the two most powerful Valar, also\nmarried. To the west of them stood the Trees of Valinor, Telperion and\nLaurelin. The entire great island of Valinor was surrounded on three\nsides (excluding the north which was instead protected by ices flows) by\na huge mountain range called the Pelóri mountains. In the extreme\nnorth-east, past the mountain range was the pass of Helcaraxë, a vast\nand treacherous ice sheet which in the beginning, before the fall of\nNúmenor, joined the two continents of Valinor and Middle-earth. In the\nbeginning, the Noldor, tricked by the evil Vala Melkor passed along this\npass to go back to Middle-earth, among those was Galadriel who was\nfeatured in the War of the Ring. Those who took this pass were not\nallowed back to Valinor for many years, but in the end pity was taken on\nthem when Middle-earth began to fade and pass into the age of men and\nthey were allowed to pass back to the Undying Lands of their own accord\nwhen they felt ready to do so.\n\nAlso, for a time after the exile of the Noldor and before the ruin of\nNúmenor, a long chain of small islands called the Enchanted Isles ran\nthe full length of the east coast to the continent. The enchanted\nislands and a bewildering shadow created the Shadowy Seas, which to\nprevent mariner, mortal or immortal, from reaching the land by sea (by\nthe Belegaer, the Great Sea which separated Middle-earth and Valinor.\nUntil the Changing of the World in the center of this sea was the isle\nof Númenor. This defence lasted centuries until Eärendil was guided\nthrough the Shadowy Seas by the light of the Silmaril brought on board\nby his wife Elwing. They sailed on Vingilot, said to be the fairest ship\never fashioned, constructed by Earendil and Cirdan the shipwright.\n\nAfter the destruction of Númenor and the Changing of the World, the\nUndying Lands were no longer a physical part of Arda so that Men could\nno longer sail to Aman or Tol Eressea. Only the Elves could sail there\nby the Straight Road and in ships capable of passing out of the Spheres\nof the earth.\n\nBy special permission of the Valar, the Hobbits Frodo Baggins, Bilbo\nBaggins, and Samwise Gamgee were also permitted to go to Valinor, and\nLegolas the elf brought with him Gimli the Dwarf.\n"

    "text": "The WAR OF THE RING was fought between Sauron and the free people of\nMiddle-earth for control of the One Ring and dominion over the\ncontinent. It took place at the end of the Third Age. Together with the\nQuest of Mount Doom, it is one of the overarching plot-lines of _The\nLord of the Rings_.\n\nThe war was initiated by Sauron, who had gained strength since the end\nof the Second Age and sought the One Ring. During the War of the Ring,\nmany thousands of Men of Rohan and Men of Gondor were killed. The\noverall number of combatants in the war is estimated to be over one\nmillion—tens of thousands from the side of the Free Peoples and hundreds\nof thousands from the Evil side. The war also signified the decline of\nthe Elves' power in Middle-earth, the rise of Men in the West, the\nrestoration of the King of Gondor and Arnor and the start of the Fourth\nAge.\n\nBattles were fought in Gondor, Rohan, Lórien, Mirkwood, at the Lonely\nMountain and at Dale. These were primarily waged against Sauron's\nforces, but Saruman, a third contender, also had armies, who fought\nbattles at the Fords of Isen and Helm's Deep.\n\nThe first full-scale battle fought in the war was the first Battle of\nthe Fords of Isen, and the war ended after the Battle of Bywater and,\nshortly afterwards, the deaths of Saruman and Gríma Wormtongue. Towards\nthe end of the War of the Ring, Elessar was crowned King of Gondor, and\nforgave the Men who had fought under Sauron, heralding a great renewal\nof cooperation and communication between Men, Elves, and Dwarves.\n\n\nOrigins of the War\n\nAccording to Mithrandir, the War of the Ring had begun at the\ntime Thorin Oakenshield met Bilbo Baggins in The Shire. Gandalf's\nreasoning is explained in the book _Unfinished Tales_. This is an\nexcerpt from a narrative of Gandalf to Frodo set in a house in Minas\nTirith. “_You may think that Rivendell was out of his reach, but I did\nnot think so. The state of things in the North was very bad. The Kingdom\nUnder the Mountain and the Strong Men of Dale were no more. To resist\nany force that Sauron might send North to regain Angmar were only the\nDwarves of the Iron Hills, and behind them lay desolation and a Dragon.\nThe Dragon Sauron might use with terrible effect._” That is why Gandalf\nthought that he had to get rid of Smaug, and he chanced upon Thorin and\nBilbo at different times, and saw the way to do it, which is told in\n_The Hobbit_.\n\nGandalf's role\n\nGandalf was to the Free Peoples of Middle-earth as a field marshal is to\nhis army fighting on the field—a master strategist and tactician. As\nseen in the opening stages of _The Fellowship of the Ring_ book and\nmovie, Gandalf the Grey would spend many hours, searching, scavenging,\nand sifting out archaic maps and accounts in long-hidden archives strewn\nabout Middle-earth. He would often carefully examine them, figuring out\nthe best way to defeat the Enemy and marshal as many allies as possible\nto his cause.\n\nGandalf likely spent much thought in strategy, before implementing his\nplans to maximum effect. He had been roaming Middle-earth for many years\nduring the Third Age, before Sauron's power was at its apex. He might\nhave had a 'hit list' of targets to neutralize that Sauron might use in\nthe next war upon the Free Peoples. One of these targets was Smaug, as\nseen in _The Hobbit._\n\nGandalf's adaptability and aptitude for strategy proved invaluable to\nhis allies during the complicated web that was to prove to become the\nWar of the Ring. As told in _Unfinished Tales_, Gandalf had known for\nquite a while that Sauron's use of Smaug would virtually guarantee\nvictory over his enemies, namely those of Gondor. He and his Dwarf\ncompanions thus set out to destroy Smaug, and bring the victory of the\nWar of the Ring one step closer for the Free Peoples.\n\nThe Roles of the other Istari\n\nSaruman became the secondary enemy in the War of the Ring, originally\nhaving served the Free Peoples and eventually succumbing to the power of\nthe One Ring.\n\nThe two Blue Wizards, Alatar and Pallando, also served an important role\nin the outcome of the war. Although they weren't directly mentioned in\nthe _Lord of the Rings_, they were enemies of Sauron, and might have\nused the Dark Elves and the Dwarves of the Red Mountains to weaken the\nEasterlings.\n\n\nEvents\n\nSouthern Theatre\n\nThe objective of Sauron's grand strategy was to defeat the strongest of\nthe nations that opposed him, Gondor, and to do so he would need to take\nthe capital city and greatest fortress of Gondor, Minas Tirith. To this\nend, the war effort of Mordor was focused in the south in and around\nGondor, in a strategy of divide and conquer. To keep Gondor's ally\nRohan, on its northern border, from sending aid, Sauron promoted the\nrise of Saruman at Isengard to the west of Rohan. Thus all of Rohan's\nforces would be focused in the west trying to stem the tide of the\nIsengard attack, and none would be sent to Minas Tirith's defence.\nMeanwhile, Sauron sent the Mordor-allied Corsairs of Umbar to attack\nGondor's populous southern coastal fiefs, which as a result sent only a\nfraction of their forces to defend Minas Tirith in northern Gondor,\nwhile the rest stayed on the coasts preparing for the Corsair assault.\nHowever, Sauron's divide and conquer strategy was ultimately foiled and\na united front of Gondor and Rohan's forces faced Mordor.\n\nRohan\n\nThe War of the Ring started in Rohan when Saruman's troops crossed the\nFords of Isen. Théodred, the son of the King Théoden, had mustered his\nforces on the fords in order to launch a surprise attack against the\nenemy. On February 23, 3019 he attacked the vanguard of the Orcs\nmarching out of Isengard. Reinforcements were quickly sent from Isengard\nhowever, and Théodred ordered a retreat. His forces retreated to an\nisland in the fords, but they were soon surrounded and he was killed.\nGrimbold managed to hold the island, but would not have succeeded if\nElfhelm had not come with reinforcements from Helm's Deep. Thus the\nfirst battle of the Fords of Isen ended in victory for the Rohirrim.\n\nNow that the Marshal of the Westmark was dead, Erkenbrand took command\nof the Westfold. He placed Grimbold and Elfhelm at the Fords. However,\nthey were unable to withstand the force of Isengard, and were\nsurrounded. Though they successfully broke through the enemy's lines,\nthey ended up scattered around the Westfold, giving Saruman clear\npassage into Rohan.\n\nMeanwhile, Gandalf drove Gríma Wormtongue out of Edoras and went to\ngather Erkenbrand's scattered forces, advising King Théoden to move to\nthe stronghold of Helm's Deep. The king and his forces arrived\nunmolested, but soon the fortress was surrounded by Saruman's troops.\nAll through the night of March 3rd-4th a combined force of Orcs and Wild\nMen from Dunland besieged Helm's Deep, and despite the efforts of the\nRohirrim (aided by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli) hope appeared lost.\nBelieving Rohan was lost, Théoden decided to mount a final, suicidal\ncharge against Saruman's forces. Unexpectedly, however, Gandalf arrived\nin the nick of time with Erkenbrand and the scattered Rohirrim, along\nwith a forest of Huorns who had been sent to the battle by Treebeard.\nThe Orcs were trapped and utterly annihilated. The wild Men were taken\ncaptive, however, were freed after swearing an oath of loyalty to Rohan\nand clearing the battlefield of the dead. (The mercy of this act amazed\nthe captives, who had been told by Saruman that the men of Rohan were\ncruel and burned their captives alive.)\n\nDays before, at an Entmoot in Fangorn Forest, the Ents, furious over the\ndestruction Saruman had wrought upon the forest, decided to march on\nIsengard. They were to move up to Isengard and destroy it. By 3 March\nthe destruction was completed, and the command of Isengard was taken by\nthe Ent Treebeard. At Gandalf's request he sent a large herd of Huorns\nto the Battle of Hornburg, to aid the Rohirrim.\n\nGondor\n\nFor over 3000 years, the realm of Gondor had held back the threat from\nthe East. In time, the kingdom declined, and Sauron prepared to swoop in\nfor the kill. Faramir, captain of Gondor, had divided his forces to too\nmany fronts. The two most important of these were in the island citadel\nof Cair Andros and the ruined city of Osgiliath. In a strict sense, the\nWar of the Ring began with the Great Signal from Minas Morgul and the\nanswering signal from Mount Doom, and thus the attack on Osgiliath was\nthe first battle of the war proper. Sauron's two armies obliterated the\nfortresses, and Faramir was forced to retreat to the causeway forts, the\nlast defence against the Morgul forces. Soon these too were destroyed,\nand only Minas Tirith remained.\n\nThe attack soon began, as the Nazgûl hovered above and spread terror and\nconfusion, and siege towers tried to take the walls but were all\ndestroyed. After several repulsed attacks, the Gate of Minas Tirith was\nbroken, and the Lord of the Nazgûl entered. He was the first and only\nenemy to do so. All seemed lost — until six thousand Rohirrim, under\nKing Théoden's command, came and somewhat relieved Gondor's defenders.\nStill, the battle was in doubt until Aragorn arrived with a large force\nout of South Gondor. The joint force of Gondor and Rohan then\nsuccessfully defeated their enemies after an exhausting day of fighting.\nThis battle resulted in the deaths of the Witch-king of Angmar, King\nTheoden, and Denethor, Steward of Gondor.\n\nThe Battle of the Morannon was the final major battle against Sauron in\nthe War of the Ring, fought at the Black Gate of Mordor. The Army of the\nWest, roughly 6,000 strong, led by Aragorn marched on the gate and faced\na vastly larger force as a diversionary feint to distract Sauron's\nattention from Frodo and Sam, who were carrying the One Ring through\nMordor. It was hoped that Sauron would think Aragorn had the Ring and\nwas now trying to use it to overthrow Mordor. Despite the seemingly\nimpossible odds the Army of the West was eventually victorious, for when\nthe Ring was destroyed, Sauron's forces fled or surrendered in dismay.\n\nNorthern Theatre\n\nMordor's war effort was focused in the south against Gondor, but using\nhis outstretched right arm Sauron attempted to flank the lands of the\nFree Peoples through Rhovanion, using orcs and allied barbarian nations\nof Men. In this theatre of the war (which had spread far across\nMiddle-earth) Sauron's primary objective was to use the forces at his\nprimary base of operations in the area, Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood,\nto defeat Lothlórien, then pass the Misty Mountains (attacking\nRivendell), and wheel around to take Rohan and Gondor from the rear.\nHowever, Dol Guldur had to deal with the threat of the Woodland Realm of\nThranduil, and thus split their forces between the attack on Lothlórien\nand the one on the Woodland Realm. Sauron wanted to use his barbarian\nEasterling allies in a joint attack with the Orcs from Dol Guldur on the\nWoodland Realm, and then have this victorious army link up with the\nother ones attacking Lothlórien and defeat it. However, unfortunately\nfor Sauron a strong and extremely powerful Dwarf nation now existed at\nthe Lonely Mountain thanks to the efforts of Gandalf, as well as the\nDwarves of the Iron Hills and allied Men of Dale. Mordor's Easterling\nallies were tied up fighting the Dwarves of Erebor and Men of Dale,and\nnever linked up with the Mordor forces assaulting the Woodland Realm,\nwhich in turn could not link up with those attacking Lothlórien, and the\nline held.\n\nBridging the gap between the northern and southern theatres of the war\nwas the line of the River Anduin between Lothlórien and Gondor, running\nalong the Rohan border. Orc armies peeling off from the assault on\nLothlórien tried to enter Rohan via this route, while almost its entire\narmy had left to fight at Minas Tirith, but the Ents of Fangorn forest\ncounterattacked and drove the orcs back in a panic, and most if not all\ndrowned while attempting to flee by crossing the river.\n\nDale and the Lonely Mountain\n\nWhen the war began, the Dwarves of Erebor\nrefused to cooperate with Sauron in his hunt for the Ring. And so Sauron\nsent an army of Easterlings to Dale. On March 17 they met the armies of\nthe Dwarves of Erebor (and of the Iron Hills as well) and the Men of\nDale. After three days of fighting, Men and Dwarves were overrun, Dale\nwas sacked and razed to ash (the second, possibly third, time in a\ncentury) and sought refuge in Erebor. The defenses of the Lonely\nMountain were prepared for the battle that would decide the fate of\nnorthern Middle-earth, and possibly even the War of the Ring itself.\n\nThe Easterlings hurled their full force at the allied armies, exploiting\ntheir dreaded heavy infantry force to punch a hole in the Dwarvish and\nMannish lines. A furious melee ensued, evolving into a tempest of fire,\ndead and dying men, and the flash of steel. Both sides took horrendous\nlosses, the Easterlings from the arrows, spears, and rocks cast from the\nLonely Mountain's cliffs, and the Men and Dwarves from the scimitars and\nmaces of the Easterlings. Finally, King Brand of Dale fell before the\ngate of the Lonely Mountain, and King under the Mountain Dáin II\nIronfoot fell as he was defending Brand's body.\n\nThe Dwarves of Erebor had learnt a crucial lesson from the devastation\nof Smaug and the Battle of the Five Armies nearly a century earlier, a\nlesson bought with the blood of loved ones. They fortified all of the\nsides of the Lonely Mountain, preventing the breakthrough of orcs that\nnearly caused the loss of the Battle in the days of Bilbo Baggins and\nThorin Oakenshield. The defenders knew with grim fatalism that there\nwould be no Beorn and no Eagles to save them this time, and they were\nthus determined to fight to the last. The Lonely Mountain was staged to\nbecome the Minas Tirith of the North, a ruthless battle of the will of\nthe defender and the will of the aggressor.\n\nThe invaders from the east constructed siege works, battering rams, and\nassorted siege catapults to bombard their enemies into submission.\nHowever, despite all of their efforts, the great gates of the Lonely\nMountain withstood the tidal wave of invaders from the East. Many Men\nand Dwarves made their escape to Erebor however and were able to\nwithstand the siege of the mountain fastness. When news spread about the\nvictory in the South, the Easterlings became extremely demoralized and\nproceeded to scatter, while the sons of Brand and Dáin let their army\nout of Erebor to break the encirclement.\n\nLothlórien and Mirkwood\n\nOn March 11, Lothlórien was first attacked from Dol Guldur. It was\nattacked two further times, on the 15 and the 22. When the Dark Lord had\nfallen, Celeborn led his army out of Lóerin, and crossed the Anduin. Dol\nGuldur was captured and destroyed by Galadriel.\n\nThranduil of Mirkwood was also attacked from Dol Guldur on March 15\nresulting in the long Battle Under the Trees, in which Thranduil's\nkinfolk won a hard victory. After the destruction of Dol Guldur,\nCeleborn met Thranduil on April 6, and as the shadow had passed, they\ndivided Mirkwood and renamed it Eryn Lasgalen.\n\nThe Shire\n\nAfter the defeat of the Dark Lord, Saruman used the magic of his voice\nto convince Treebeard to release him from Isengard. He travellled to the\nShire, where he replaced Lotho Sackville-Baggins as the Chief under the\nname _Sharkey_. Under his command Ruffian men entered The Shire and\nruined it. They were defeated by Hobbits under the lead of Meriadoc\nBrandybuck and Peregrin Took in the Battle of Bywater on the 3rd of\nNovember. The Hobbits headed to Hobbiton where Frodo ordered Saruman and\nWormtongue to leave the Shire. Wormtongue, however, killed Saruman,\nbefore he himself was killed by the Hobbits and their arrows. With the\ndeath of the wizard Saruman, the War of the Ring finally ended, as did\nthen the Third Age.\n\n\nConsequences and Legacy\n\nThe War of the Ring had great influence on all of the lands of the\nnorthwest of Middle-earth. Most importantly it led to the restoration of\nthe Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor as the Reunited Kingdom, under King\nElessar Telcontar. The Steward of Gondor was dead, but he was succeeded\nby his son Faramir, who kept the office and was given the title _Prince\nof Ithilien_.\n\nIn Rohan the heir apparent, Théodred, was killed, and, during the Battle\nof Pelennor Fields, King Théoden died as well. He was succeeded by his\nnephew Éomer. In the Glittering Caves at the Hornburg, a Dwarven colony\nwas established, and Isengard was given to the Ents, who filled\nSaruman's pits and reforested the land, renaming it The Treegarth of\nOrthanc\n\nIn Dale, both King Brand and King Dáin II Ironfoot were killed, who were\nsucceeded by their sons Bard and Thorin III Stonehelm. They sent their\nemissaries to the crowning of Elessar, and were in alliance with Gondor\nuntil their Kingdoms ended.\n\nFor the Elves, the final decline had begun. With the destruction of the\nOne Ring, the power of the Three Rings faded, and the kingdoms that had\nbeen preserved by their magic began to fade with them. The bearers of\nthe Rings left Middle-earth, and Lórien was eventually abandoned. The\nElves of Lothlórien who did not depart over the Sea moved east to the\nsouthern third of Mirkwood, below the Narrows, which they named East\nLórien. In Eryn Lasgalen however, Thranduil's rule continued, and they\nhad peace. There was also an Elven colony in Ithilien. Many of the Elves\nof Rivendell departed over the Sea, and by Aragorn's death 120 years\nlater, it was entirely deserted.\n\nIn the Shire life continued as it had prior to the war. It was declared\na free land under the Sceptre of Annúminas, and Men were forbidden to\nenter it. The Westmarch was added to the Shire by King Elessar in SR\n1452.\n\nThe different races of Men that had served Sauron suffered grievously at\nthe hands of what appeared to be booty and loot just begging them to\ncome; much of Harad's army was annihilated on the Pelennor Fields,\nslaughtered by the swords of Gondor and the lances of Rohan. The mighty\nEasterlings hastily retreated back to their homelands after Sauron's\nfall and fought several territorial wars with King Elessar over lands\nnear the Sea of Rhûn, but ceased to be a threat altogether. While they\nwere still a menace, much like a sleeping viper, they never troubled the\nReunited Kingdom again.\n\nOnce the Fourth Age began, the elves stopped having an active influence\non the affairs of Middle-earth, having started fading away ever since\nthe Third Age. Orcs never became a serious threat again, reduced to\nsmall bands of mountain brigands they were never more than a nuisance.\nAll the Nazgûl were killed, with Sauron reduced to a mere shadow of\nmalice. Wars would still be fought by the Reunited Kingdom and Rohan\nagainst the Men that had allied with Sauron, the Haradrim and\nEasterlings."

    "text": "The_' Haradrim, KNOWN IN WESTRON AS THE Southrons_' and once as the\n“SWERTINGS” by Hobbits, were a race of Men from Harad in the region of\nMiddle-earth directly south of Gondor. A part of the histories of the\nWestlands is given to the fierce people who in the Second and the Third\nAge of the Sun, came from the hot deserts and forests of sunlands, which\nlay in the South of Middle-earth. These people were ruled by many and\nlords, until in time Sauron the Maia corrupted them and called them to\nwar.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the Second Age the Men of Númenor built a great city in the firth\nof Umbar, a vast natural harbour on the southern shores of the Bay of\nBelfalas, eventually turning the city into a fortified citadel from\nwhose gates the Men of Númenor could levy great tributes upon many of\nthe tribes of Harad.\n\nFor many years, the Haradrim were the greatest enemy of Gondor. Several\ntimes, they invaded the north. Finally, the Men of Gondor were able to\ncapture Harad, though it was later freed. During the War of the Ring the\nHaradrim were allied with Sauron. A Haradrim warrior wounded Faramir. At\nthe Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the 18,000 Haradrim were a great\nthreat to the Rohirrim that had come to aid the people of Minas Tirith.\nDuring the onslaught a Haradrim chieftain, who bore the standard of a\nblack serpent on a scarlet field, led the Haradrim cavalry. King Théoden\nof Rohan slew him in single combat.\n\nOnce Sauron was destroyed, the Haradrim, Variags, and Easterlings\ndisbanded from the Black Gates and out of Mordor, and became dispersed.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _HARADRIM_ means “South-people”, from the Sindarin _harad_\n(“south”) and _rim_ (“host, group”).\n\nOther names were SOUTHERNS, SOUTHRONS.\n\n\nTraits and culture\n\nThe Haradrim were bold and grim men, fierce in despair. They were tall\nand dark-skinned with black hair and dark eyes, and for that they were\ncalled SWERTINGS or SWARTHY MEN. The men of Near Harad were\nbrown-skinned, with black hair and dark eyes, while the race known as\n“half-trolls” out of Far Harad had black skin.\n\nMany Haradrim warriors were seen in bright clothing, such as scarlet\nrobes, and were decorated with golden ornaments, such as collars,\nearrings, corsets of overlapping brazen plates; they braided their hair\nwith gold. Some tribes painted their bodies. Scarlet and red was also\nthe color of their banners, tips of their spears, and body paint. Their\nshields were yellow and black with spikes. It is also mentioned that\nat the end of the Second Age some of the Men in the south had weapons of\niron. At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Haradrim bore\nscimitars that glittered like stars.\n\nThe Haradrim had tamed the massive _Mûmakil_ beasts and used them in\nwarfare and, like their masters, were decorated with scarlet and gold.\nThey even strapped towers on their backs, used by Haradrim archers and\nspearmen.\n\nHarad's tribes included into those of Near and Far Harad, although there\nwere many tribes of the Haradrim, often mutually hostile. Some of the\npeoples of Far Harad were organized into kingdoms.\n\nLanguage\n\nTo the Gondorians their voices sounded harsh, like shouts of beasts.\n\nThe only word which is stated to come from a southron language is\n“Mûmak”, the name of the great war-oliphaunts of Harad.\n\nGandalf states that his name in “the south” is “Incánus” thought\n_Inkā-nūsh_ (or possibly _Inkā-nūs_), meaning “North-spy”.\n\nDespite having a meaning in Quenya (“fate”), the name Umbar is said to\nbe adapted from the natives' language and not from Elvish or Adûnaic.\n\n\nEnvironment\n\n\n\nThe lands of the Haradrim lie to the south of Gondor past the river\nPoros. In the land south of Gondor, the sun beat down unrelentingly,\ncooking much of Haradwaith into desert.\n\n\nMilitary Tactics\n\n\n\nThe Haradrim are said to be skilled horsemen, though not near the\nprowess of the Rohirrim. They are known to have mounted champions and\narchers, as well as infantry. Horses fear the Mumakil, and so the\nSouthron forces often rally around them when faced with mounted foes.\n\n\nFuture of Harad\n\nMuch of Harad's impressive army was wiped out on the expanses of\nPelennor Fields, during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. With Sauron\ndefeated, many Harad peoples sent emissaries to the court of King\nAragorn, and peace talks began; however, many other Haradrim tribes\ncontinued hostility with Gondor.\n",

    "text": "The WHITE MOUNTAINS or ERED NIMRAIS was a mountain range in\nMiddle-earth that lay east-to-west across the length of Gondor.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe mountains were named after the glaciers of their highest peaks. The\nrange lay mostly East-West, but also had a northern section, which was\nseparated from the main line of the Misty Mountains by the Gap of Rohan.\nEven at the southern latitude of Gondor and Rohan, the White Mountains\nbore snow even in summer, suggesting they were extremely high. The range\nhad no passes. The Paths of the Dead passed under it, but only the most\ncourageous (or foolhardy) ever ventured that route. The White Mountains\nformed the northern boundary of Gondor and the southern boundary of\nRohan except in their easternmost provinces, where Gondor's province of\nAnorien lay to the north of the mountains.\n\nBecause of their always bearing snow at their highest peaks, the White\nMountains must have been at least 4800 meters (16'000 feet) above sea\nlevel, with occasional peaks probably in excess of 5500 meters. They\nwere, however, not as high as the Misty Mountains.\n\nIts notable peaks included _Irensaga_ “Iron Saw” and _Starkhorn_.\nBetween these two lay the _Dwimorberg_, entrance to the Paths of the\nDead.\n\nAt the eastern end, the city of Minas Tirith was carved into\n_Mindolluin_ mountain. The Warning beacons of Gondor were placed on top\nof seven peaks in the range: _Amon Dîn_, _Eilenach_, _Nardol_, _Erelas_,\n_Min-Rimmon_, _Calenhad_ and _Halifirien_.\n\nSeveral rivers raised in the White Mountains, among them: the Adorn (a\ntributary of Isen), and the Snowbourn and Mering Stream (tributaries of\nthe Entwash); and, on the south side, the Erui (a tributary of Anduin),\nthe Ringló and its tributary Ciril (which together with the Morthond all\nentered the Bay of Belfalas at Edhellond near Dol Amroth), the Lefnui of\nthe Anfalas, and the Five Rivers of Lebennin.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe natives to the White Mountains were Drúedain who inhabited this\nregion in the Second Age. The only remnants of the Druedain's presence\nin this mountain range were their statues called the _Púkel-men_.\nSometime thereafter, evil men related to the Dunlendings drove the\nDrúedain out. Some of these men swore allegiance to Isildur, but\nbetrayed him and were cursed into the Army of the Dead. Aragorn,\nLegolas, and Gimli followed the Paths of the Dead in year 3019 of the\nThird Age and convinced the army to fight for Gondor in the War of the\nRing. After they did so, Aragorn released the Army of the Dead, for they\nhad fulfilled their oath. After and perhaps before the War of the Ring\nDwarves settled in the White Mountain, where they could have better\ncontact with their allies.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ERED NIMRAIS_ is a Sindarin name: _Ered_ ('Mountains') and _Nimrais_\n('White peaks')",

Tolkien that were\nnever completed during his lifetime, but were edited and concluded by\nhis son Christopher Tolkien and published in 1980.\n\n\nPublication and edition\n\nUnlike _The Silmarillion_, in which the narrative fragments were\nmodified to connect into a consistent and coherent work, the _Unfinished\nTales_ are presented as Tolkien left them, with little more than names\nchanged (the author having had a confusing habit of trying out different\nnames for a character while writing a draft). Thus some of these are\nincomplete stories, while others are collections of “factual”\ninformation about Middle-earth. Each tale is followed by a long series\nof Christopher's notes explaining inconsistencies and obscure points.\n\nAs with _The Silmarillion_, Christopher Tolkien edited and published\n_Unfinished Tales_ before he had finished his study of the materials in\nhis father's archive. Despite its shortcomings in editorial consistency,\n_Unfinished Tales_ does provide more detailed information about\ncharacters, events and places mentioned only briefly in _The Lord of the\nRings_. Versions of such tales including the origins of Gandalf and the\nWizards, the death of Isildur and the loss of the One Ring in the\nGladden Fields, and the founding of the kingdom of Rohan help expand\nknowledge about Middle-earth.\n\nOf particular note is the tale of Tar-Aldarion and Erendis (chapter two\nof Part Two), the only known story of Númenor before its fall. A map of\nNúmenor is also included in the book.\n\nThe _Unfinished Tales_ had commercial success, demonstrating that the\ndemand for Tolkien's stories several years after his death was not only\nstill present, it was actually growing. Considering this, Christopher\nTolkien began to embark upon the more ambitious twelve-volume work\nentitled _The History of Middle-earth_ which encompassed nearly the\nentire corpus of Tolkien's writings about Middle-earth.\n\n\nContents\n\nPart One: The First Age:\n\n-   “Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin”\n-   “Narn i Chîn Húrin (The Tale of the Children of Húrin)”\n\nPart Two: The Second Age:\n\n-   “A Description of the Island of Númenor”\n-   “Aldarion and Erendis: The Mariner's Wife”\n-   “The Line of Elros: Kings of Númenor”\n-   “The History of Galadriel and Celeborn”\n\nPart Three: The Third Age:\n\n-   “The Disaster of the Gladden Fields”\n-   “Cirion and Eorl and the Friendship of Gondor and Rohan”\n-   “The Quest of Erebor”\n-   “The Hunt for the Ring”\n-   “The Battles of the Fords of Isen”\n\nPart Four\n\n-   “The Drúedain”\n-   “The Istari”\n-   “The Palantíri”"

    "text": "LINDON was a Elven Kingdom founded by Gil-galad at the beginning of the\nSecond Age. It was the longest-standing Eldarin Kingdom in the history\nof Middle-earth, and the mightiest throughout the Second Age. It was\nruled by its founder, Gil-galad, the High King of the Ñoldor, who,\nduring that age, was the strongest and most powerful enemy of Sauron in\nMiddle-earth.\n\nThe realm endured through the Third Age, though diminished, and was the\nsite of the Grey Havens, where the Elves, as well as the Ring-bearers,\nsailed to the Undying Lands.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nLindon was located in what remained of Ossiriand; the Land of Seven\nRivers and all that was left of the peninsula of Beleriand after the War\nof Wrath. The mountains, partially sunk in the ruin of Beleriand,\nformed a portion of the realm's east border. The realm reached as far\nnorth over the mountains as the Little Lune. North of that boundary was\nwhat remained of the Dwarf kingdom of Belegost. After the ruin of\nBeleriand, Gil-Galad founded the realm of Lindon, which encompassed all\nthe land west of the Blue Mountains and east of the sea in the North of\nMiddle-earth. The Gulf of Lune broke the realm of Lindon into Forlindon\nand Harlindon. The Grey Havens lay at the mouth of the river Lune.\nThrough a break in the Blue Mountains, the land of Eriador lay to the\neast, and farther southeast laid the Shire. Eastward also lay the\nKingdom of Eregion, at the feet of the Misty Mountains, which was also\nruled by Gil-Galad under the lordship of Celebrimbor. Towards the\nend of the Second Age, the realm of Arnor was established by Elendil to\nthe northeast of Lindon.\n\nThe lands of Lindon were said to be lush and green, with thick forests\nlining the foothills of the Blue Mountains. The havens of the elves were\nfound along the Gulf of Lune, where the land became rocky yet lush along\nthe coast. Tolkien stated that Lindon was Elven country “where no Man\ndwells”. It was the last realm that was fair and free. It also had a\nmildly tempered climate, with mild winters and mild summers.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the Second Age\n\n_Lindon_ was another name for the Ossiriand in East Beleriand, where the\nLaiquendi dwelt.\n\nSecond Age\n\nAfter the War of Wrath, those Elves who had sought refuge on the coast\nof the sea at the mouths of the river Sirion removed into the land that\nwas left in the northwest of Middle-earth. They, led by Gil-Galad,\nestablished the realm of Lindon in SA 1. In the North at Forlindon\nGil-galad ruled a majority of Noldorin Elves. In southern Harlindon,\nCeleborn ruled a fiefdom of many Sindar and the remaining Green Elves of\nBeleriand under Gil-Galad. He did not rule under Gil-galad for long,\nthough, eventually removing to the shores of Lake Nenuial with his wife,\nGaladriel. At the Grey Havens Círdan was the lord of many shipbuilders\nof the Teleri who survived the ruin of the First Age. The Elves believed\nnow that the threat of Morgoth was removed, and Lindon became a fair\nkingdom. Gil-galad and the Elves of Lindon had a very strong friendship\nwith Númenor and its kings before the Darkening of Númenor.\n\nEarly in the sixth century of the Second Age, the first ships of Númenor\nreturned to Middle-earth. Vëantur, father-in-law of Tar-Meneldur, led\nthe first expedition. Later he returned with his grandson and heir to\nthe throne, Aldarion, and the Númenoreans were well liked by Gil-galad\nand his people. Tar-Aldarion continued his voyages to Lindon throughout\nhis reign as the sixth King of Númenor, and Gil-galad and Círdan taught\nmuch to the mariners of Númenor. Gil-galad befriended Aldarion and gave\nhim and his father, Tar-Meneldur, many gifts. After the reign of\nAldarion, Númenor was less active in the affairs of Lindon for many\nhundred years, though friendship remained.\n\nIn the twelfth century, Sauron attempted to infiltrate Lindon disguised\nas 'Annatar', the Lord of Gifts. His strength now on the mend after\nMorgoth's defeat, Sauron purposed to corrupt the strongest of all the\nremaining Elf-kingdoms. Gil-galad denied him, and so did Elrond, who\ndwelt then with the King in Forlindon. Though they did not know\nAnnatar's true identity at the time, the wise king of Lindon foresaw\nevil in Annatar. Sauron then turned his attention to Eregion, where he\nsucceeded in befriending the Noldorin smiths under Celebrimbor who\nworked there.\n\n\n\nAfter Sauron forged the One Ring at the beginning of the sixth century,\nhe declared war on the Elf-kingdoms to capture the Rings of Power they\nhad hidden from him. Gil-galad sent a small army led by Elrond east to\nthe aid of Eregion. There he joined with Celeborn, but Sauron's forces\ndefeated the combined force. His army ravaged Eregion and the rest of\nEriador, and came to the borders of Lindon. There, Gil-galad's forces\ndug in against the forces of Sauron, and were strengthened by a great\nfleet sent from Númenor by Tar-Minastir, the King of Númenor, under his\nson and heir Ciryatan. With the aid of the Númenoreans, participating in\ntheir first war upon Middle-Earth, Lindon was freed and Sauron's forces\noverthrown. Sauron returned to Mordor and focused his attention now on\nruining Númenor.\n\nIn the year SA 3319 of the Second Age, Númenor was destroyed, and\nElendil and sons and his remnant of Faithful Númenoreans landed on the\ncoast of Middle-earth. Elendil established the Realms in Exile which\nwere the North-Kingdom of Arnor and the South-Kingdom of Gondor. He\nbecame close friends and ally with Gil-galad, and they pledged support\nto one another against the preparing blow of Sauron, who had risen to\npower once again after fleeing the ruin of Númenor.\n\nThe War of the Last Alliance began in SA 3434, and the Elves of Lindon\nformed a large part of the backbone of the Elven armies. Elendil's\nNúmenorean refugees, along with Dúnedain who had removed to Middle-Earth\nbefore the destruction of Númenor, marched alongside the host of\nGil-galad, and eventually they laid siege to the Dark Tower. Sauron\nhimself then came to battle, and fought Gil-galad and Elendil. The two\nkings defeated him but died in the process. Then, Isildur son of Elendil\ncut the ring from Sauron's hand, and he was for a time defeated.\n\nThird Age\n\nAfter the death of Gil-galad, the lordship of Lindon passed to Círdan;\nand the line of Noldorin kings in Middle-Earth came to an end. The\npopulation of Lindon had been reduced by the long and bloody war with\nSauron. With the loss of their king, many of the Noldor and Sindar left\nfor Valinor. Following the war, many Elves began to come to the Grey\nHavens and sail to Valinor, further depleting Lindon's population.\nCírdan continued his shipbuilding, and had much work constructing the\nvessels to carry the Elves west. However, the kingdom began to dwindle\nas the ships continued to sail.\n\nThe Witch-king of Angmar attacked the Kingdom of Arnor in the thirteenth\ncentury of the Third Age. Lindon lent what aid it could to the Dúnedain,\nbut after many years, the North-Kingdom was overthrown. The Dúnedain\nwent into exile, and the kingdom of Lindon shrank rapidly into a safe\nhaven for the Elves of Middle-earth. By the time of the War of the Ring,\nit was a shadow of its former glory, with only Grey Havens seeing\nregular traffic and activity. After Sauron's defeat, the last Elves\nbegan to sail for Valinor, and Círdan remained there well into the\nFourth Age, awaiting the last ship to sail west himself.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _LINDON_ means “Land of the Singers”, from the Quenya term\n_lin_ or _lind_ (“to sing, make musical sound”) and _-on_, which\nis a common suffix for regions.",

    "text": "The DAGOR BRAGOLLACH or BATTLE OF THE SUDDEN FLAME was the fourth of the\ngreat battles of the War of the Jewels. It marked the end of the Siege\nof Angband and beginning of Morgoth's gains against the Elves and Men of\nthe Beleriand.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\n\n\nFor four hundred years after Dagor Aglareb the Ñoldor had managed to\ncontain Morgoth's power inside Angband. Peace and prosperity reigned in\nBeleriand, to the point where green grass grew even to the very doors of\nAngband. The strength of the Elven kingdoms, and that of their Edain\nallies, became such that Fingolfin, High King of the Ñoldor, believed\nthat the siege would last forever. But though the Elves and Edain had\nmanaged to contain Morgoth's forces, it was beyond their power to\nassault Angband or to overthrow the power of Morgoth. As such, the Dark\nLord labored undisturbed in Angband during the siege, breeding countless\nlegions of Orcs and other evil creatures, as well creating the first\nDragon. He intended to use this new, unprecedentedly powerful force to\nutterly destroy those who had opposed him. However, in the furious haste\nof his malice, he decided to strike before his designs were complete,\ncynically underestimating the valor of the Elves, and not accounting for\nthe Edain at all. This haste was credited as the reason why resistance\nagainst Morgoth was able to continue after the conclusion of the\nconflict; for if Morgoth had waited for a short time longer to complete\nthe buildup of his forces, his foes would have been annihilated.\n\nOn a cold winter's night when the Elven watch was at its least vigilant,\nMorgoth sent out rivers of flame and poisonous fumes from Thangorodrim\nand the Iron Mountains. The plains of Ard-galen were consumed by the\nfire and transformed into a barren desert which was renamed\nAnfauglith, “the Gasping Dust”. The Elves had never faced an assault of\nthis sort before, and many perished as they fled from these flames.\nBehind them came the Balrogs, Glaurung the Father of Dragons, and\nlegions of Orcs in such numbers as the Elves had never imagined.\nMorgoth's primary aim was an onslaught so rapid that the various\nkingdoms of the Elves would not be able to consolidate their forces or\ncome to each others aid. And so it was that each of the Elven kingdoms\nhad to fight Morgoth's forces on their own. The Orcs quickly overran the\nhighlands of Dorthonion, and slew Angrod and Aegnor. Maglor's horsemen\nwere burnt alive on the plain of Lothlann, and Maglor's Gap was taken,\ngiving Morgoth an entry into Beleriand. Maglor retreated with heavy\nlosses to Himring, where he helped defend the city of Maedhros. Though\ngrievously besieged, the heavily fortified city did not fall, and\nMaedhros himself accomplished deeds of surpassing valor during the\nfighting.\n\nThe Pass of Aglon was also breached, and Celegorm and Curufin fled north\nof Doriath to Nargothrond. Morgoth's Orcs took the mountain forests of\nMount Rerir, and defiled Lake Helevorn, scattering south through\nThargelion into East Beleriand. Caranthir fled to Amon Ereb, where he\nand Amrod built defenses. From there they slowly freed East Beleriand of\nthe Orcs, while Maglor and Maedhros held the northern border.\nEventually, Maedhros even managed to re-secure the Pass of Aglon,\ndenying the forces of Morgoth continued entry into Beleriand from that\nroute.\n\n\n\nMinas Tirith in the Pass of Sirion in the West under Orodreth held, and\nOrodreth's uncle and Lord Finrod Felagund came north from Nargothrond\nwith a large army. However, they were ambushed by a huge number of\nMorgoth's forces at the Fen of Serech. The Noldor found themselves\ntrapped, and Finrod would have been killed or taken but for a sortie by\nBarahir and his men, who descended from Dorthonion and rescued the Elven\nlord. The cost in lives was heavy, but Finrod escaped the Orcs. In\nprofound gratitude, Finrod gave Barahir his ring, which would become\nknown as the Ring of Barahir, and pledged that he would aid Barahir and\nhis kin in any time of need.\n\nFinrod and his folk fled south to Nargothrond, while Barahir continued\ndefending Dorthonion until both his forces and his people dwindled to\nnothing. The mountain forts of the Ered Wethrin around Hithlum were\nheavily assaulted but managed barely to hold, as the mountains\nthemselves provided protection from the fires Morgoth had released from\nThangorodrim.\n\nThus the Siege was broken, the Sons of Fëanor scattered, and the forces\nof Morgoth roamed at will throughout the north.\n\nWhen Fingolfin, the High King of the Ñoldor, learned of the heavy\ncasualties of so many Ñoldor, he rode in wrath across the dust of\nAnfauglith to Angband and challenged Morgoth to single combat. At the\ndoors of Angband itself, they fought a great duel, and Fingolfin wounded\nMorgoth seven times. Yet, Fingolfin was ultimately no match for the Dark\nLord and was crushed beneath Morgoth's foot, but not before stabbing\nMorgoth in the heel with his last stroke. Thorondor, king of the Great\nEagles, then swooped down and retrieved Fingolfin's body and scarred\nMorgoth's face. Though Morgoth's wounds would never heal and he was left\nwith a permanent limp, Morgoth and his forces were nevertheless\nvictorious.\n\nStill, Morgoth was cautious. For though he had won a great victory, his\nfoes had inflicted upon him loss as great as their own. As his initial\nonslaught had abated, his foes had begun to recover, making small\nadvances into the fringes of the territory he had conquered. He had not\nexpected the Elves to resist him so strongly, and the aid of their Edain\nallies had been a completely unforeseen variable in his plans. As such,\nhe checked his assault and recalled the main host of the Orcs to\nAngband.\n\nTwo years after Morgoth's onslaught abated, the isle of Tol Sirion, held\nby Orodreth brother of Finrod, came under assault by Morgoth's most\nterrible servant, Sauron. His coming caused a dark cloud of fear to grip\nthe hearts and wills of the defenders, and the watchtower of Minas\nTirith upon the isle was taken. This secured for Morgoth the western\npass of the river Sirion. After another five years had passed, Morgoth\nrenewed his assault against Hithlum and very nearly destroyed it.\nFortunately for Fingon, now High King of the Ñoldor, his forces were\nreinforced by a host under the command of Círdan, and the Orcs were\nrepelled.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_DAGOR BRAGOLLACH_ is Sindarin for 'Battle of Sudden Flame'.",

Castamir also murdered Eldacar's son and heir Ornendil.\nEldacar fled to Rhovanion, and Castamir ruled in his stead.\n\nA full decade later, in TA 1447, Eldacar returned with Rhovanion troops;\nat the same time a rebellion against Castamir's cruel rule took place.\nEldacar managed to kill Castamir at the Battle of Erui, but Castamir's\nsons and many of their supporters fled south to Umbar. Eldacar could not\nfollow them, as the fleet was under Castamir's control.\n\nNot only did Gondor lose the city of Umbar for four centuries and gain a\nnew enemy in the Corsairs of Umbar, descendants of Castamir's sons, but\nalso many of the Númenóreans of purest blood were killed during the\ncivil war, leaving Gondor weakened.\n\nThe Kin-strife was, along with the Great Plague and sheer laziness one\nof the chief reasons for the abandonment of the fortresses in and\nsurrounding Mordor."

    "text": "DUNLAND was the land of the wild men, or 'Dunlendings'. _Dunland_ means\n_Hill Land_ in the language of neighboring Rohan, whose people named it\nafter arriving in nearby Calenardhon in the later Third Age.\n\n\nInhabitants\n\nDunland was inhabited by the Dunlendings, Men who were mostly bearded\nand had dirty faces, and long matted hair. They wore clothes of leather\nand animal skin and carried weapons that were simple but effective for\ntheir purpose. They usually fought with clubs and pitchforks, and at\ntimes they carried torches to act as lights at night and to burn\nbuildings by day. The buildings that Dunlendings lived and worked in\nwere crude shacks of wood and animal skin that were often sabotaged by\nWargs and sometimes the Rohirrim.\n\nThe vernacular of this land's inhabitants, including possibly the\nStoors, was Dunlendish.\n\nAncestors of the Dunlendings inhabited the forested regions of\nMiddle-earth on either side of the Gwathló in the early Second Age; thus\nthe early Númenóreans called them _Gwaithuirim_. They spoke a language\nrelated to that of the Second House of Men, the Haladin, rather than the\nvastly different Bëorian-Marachian tongue which stood at the base of\nAdûnaic, and this lack of mutual understanding led to outright\nhostility. The Númenóreans greedily harvested _Gwaithuirim_ forests for\ntimber, and after much war and bloodshed, the _Gwaithuirim_ from south\nof the Gwathló fled east to the Hithaeglir while others scattered to the\ncape of Eryn Vorn and the White Mountains.\n\nAt the end of the Second Age, the land north of the Gwathló and south of\nthe Baranduin was named Minhiriath “Land between the Rivers”, although\nthe land south of Minhiriath remained unnamed. Its inhabitants were\nlargely ignored despite the fact that the Gondor colonial city of\nTharbad grew up on the Gwathló west of the Misty Mountain hillfolk who\nhad been _Gwaithuirim_ long before. It was not until Gondor abandoned\nthis city in TA 2050 that the people and their land were renamed: both\nbecame known as Enedwaith “Middle-Folk, Middle Region”, because they\nowed no allegiance to the North or South Kingdom.\n\nThe Hillfolk of the Hithaeglir kept their hatred of the descendants of\nNúmenor (unlike those of Eryn Vorn and the White Mountains, who\nnevertheless remained uncooperative). The Dead Men of Dunharrow who\nbetrayed Isildur were descended from _Gwaithurim_.\n\nIn T.A. 2770, Smaug the Dragon destroyed the Kingdom under the Mountain.\nDwarves fleeing from this disaster settled in Dunland, from\nwhere Thrór departed when he and his companion Nár journeyed\nto Moria in T.A. 2790. After the Battle of Azanulbizar, provoked by\nthe Orcs' brutal slaying of Thrór, Thráin II and Thorin led the remnants\nof their followers back to Dunland but soon left (to eventually settle\nin the Blue Mountains).\n\nWhen Gondor decided to give the depopulated province of Calenardhon to\nthe numerous people of Éothéod in TA 2510, the Hillfolk of the\nHithaeglir felt threatened by these _Forgoil_ “Strawheads” (a demeaning\nreference to the blonde hair of the refugees from Calenardhon). The\nHillfolk had slowly colonised Calenardhon during the dwindling of the\nDúnedain and had already reclaimed all the land between the Adorn and\nIsen. Still, open war was not waged until the reign of Helm Hammerhand\n(TA 2741 - TA 2759). Freca, the Lord of the Hillmen (whom the Rohirrim\nnow called Dunlendings) tried to get the throne of Rohan for himself by\npetitioning for the marriage of his son Wulf to the daughter of Helm.\nThe Hill-men leader Freca was killed and Wulf led the Dunlendings into\nopen war with Rohan. They unsuccessfully besieged the Hornburg during\nthe Long Winter of TA 2758 - TA 2759. Wulf did take Edoras and killed\nHaleth, the son of Helm, in front of the golden hall of Meduseld.\nNonetheless, Helm's nephew Fréalaf held out against the Dunlendings in\nthe refuge of Dunharrow. He recaptured Edoras at the end of the Long\nWinter and killed Wulf personally. The Dunlendings were driven out of\nRohan, and Fréalaf succeeded the deceased Helm Hammerhand.\n\nGuarding the Gap of Rohan was the fortress of Isengard, where a\nhereditary guard watched for Gondor. However, by the time of the Steward\nof Gondor Beren, these guards had mixed with Dunlendings, and it had\nbecome hostile to Gondor. To remedy this situation, Beren gave Saruman\nthe keys to Orthanc to guard Isengard for Gondor.\n\nSaruman used the historical hostility against outlanders to tempt the\nDunlendings into supporting him during the War of the Ring. In The Two\nTowers extended edition, the Dunlending warlord is shown giving a\nblood-oath to Saruman.\n\nAfter the battle at Helm's Deep, the Rohirrim allowed the surviving\nDunlendings to return to their homes. The Rohirrim required that all\nhostilities cease and that the Dunlendings again retreat behind the\nIsen.\n\n\nNearby locations\n\n-   North: Galanduin River\n-   East: Misty Mountains\n-   South: Isengard\n-   West: Enedwaith\n",

    "text": "The FIRST BATTLE OF THE FORDS OF ISEN was the first battle between\nSaruman's armies and the Rohirrim. There were two battles at the Fords\nof Isen. The first battle took place on February 25, 3019. The second\nwas on March 2, 3019.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThéodred, son of King Théoden of Rohan, was alerted by his scouts to the\nmustering taking place in Isengard. He manned both sides of the ford and\nwent forward leaving three companies of riders to guard the eastern\nside. Early in the morning, he crossed over to the western side with a\nforce mainly consisting of archers and cavalry. He planned to take the\nforces of Uruk-hai by surprise.\n\nHowever, Saruman had tricked the scouts; his army was already marching\nout to attack the ford. Twenty miles to the north of the ford, Théodred\nencountered the vanguard of the Uruk-hai and quickly cut through their\nlines. He then charged at the main force,\nwhich were prepared for the attack and were stationed behind trenches\nplanted with pikes. Reinforcements came out of Isengard and outflanked\nthe cavalry, nearly surrounding them. Hastily Théodred ordered a\nretreat, but the Uruk-hai could not be shaken off that easily. Grimbold,\nwho was in command of the Rohirrim rearguard, had to cut down their\npursuers many times.\n\nSaruman's eastern force was much smaller but more dangerous. It\ncontained Dunlendings, Warg riders and Uruk-hai. The Rohirrim guard on\nthe eastern side of the ford had been driven into retreat, and their\nattackers recrossed the ford to attack Théodred on both sides. Théodred\nand his men had dismounted on a small islet to cover Grimbold's retreat.\nAt the same time Grimbold's force was being attacked from the western\nside, and as Grimbold looked east, he saw Théodred's force being driven\nfrom the islet to a hill. Grimbold and a few men raced toward Théodred's\nposition. Théodred was cutting his way through the Uruk-hai lines. But\nby the time Grimbold reached him, Théodred had fallen, cut down by a\ngiant Orc. Grimbold slew the Orc and then found himself defending\nThéodred's body from enemies. He himself would have been cut down had it\nnot been for Elfhelm.\n\nElfhelm had been leading four companies towards Helm's Deep, when it was\nreported to him that two Warg riders had been spotted. He rode at full\nspeed to the ford and, seeing the situation, ordered his men to charge.\nBefore long his men held the western side of the ford. They then charged\non the islet. From this surprise attack most of the Uruk-hai retreated\ntoward Isengard. When they reached the islet they found Grimbold\ndefending Théodred's body against two huge Orcs. Elfhelm rushed to his\naid and felled one enemy while Grimbold slew the other.\n\nWhen they lifted Théodred's body, they found he was still alive. He\nlived long enough to say, “Let me lie here -to keep the ford until Éomer\ncomes.” The enemy attack ended by nightfall. The Rohirrim had held the\nford but suffered heavy losses.\n",

    "page_id": "2269",
    "text": "RANGERS OF THE NORTH, or simply THE RANGERS, were the northern\nwandering people of Eriador, the last remnant of the Dúnedain of Arnor,\nwho had once peopled the North Kingdom of Arnor. They protected the\nlands they wandered although their secretiveness made other peoples\nconsider them dangerous and distrustful in Bree and the Shire, where\nthey were known as “Watchers”.\n\nThey were grim in appearance and were usually dressed in grey or dark\ngreen, with a cloak-clasp shaped like a 6-pointed star.\n\nThe term 'Rangers of the North' was used most often by those who lived\nin the southern lands of Rohan and Gondor, perhaps to distinguish this\npeople from their distant cousins, the Rangers of Ithilien. Like the\nRangers of the North, these were also Dúnedain, but they belonged to the\nSouth-kingdom of Gondor, and their ancestors had been divided from the\nNorthern Dúnedain for some three thousand years.\n\n\nBackground\n\n The Dúnedain of\nArnor dwindled after the breaking of Arnor into three kingdoms and the\nwars with Angmar. Cardolan and Rhudaur soon fell and only the\npetty-kingdom of Arthedain maintained the noble line of Isildur.\nFinally, that too was destroyed in the Battle of Fornost and Arvedui,\nthe last King of Arthedain was lost in the sea.\n\nArvedui's son and heir, Aranarth claimed the title of the Chieftain, who\nwould rule the remnants of his people. Elrond had in his keeping the\nheirlooms of the house of Isildur: the shards of Narsil, the Star of\nElendil, the Sceptre of Annúminas and later the Ring of Barahir,\nransomed from the Lossoth.\n\nEach of Aranarth's heirs (who, like him, could trace his descent back to\nIsildur himself) would be secretly born and raised in Rivendell.\n\nThe Rangers became a secretive wandering and nomadic people around\nEriador, far from Sauron's spies, little known or remembered, and their\ndeeds were seldom recorded.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Watchful Peace followed the loss of Arnor and after its end, the\nenemies concentrated mostly against Rhovanion and Gondor. During that\ntime, the Rangers fought minor battles and skirmishes against orcs and\nwolves in order to keep the region safe. The hobbits of the Shire\nflourished under their protection.\n\nDuring the rule of Arassuil, the Orcs of the Misty Mountains became more\nbold, daring to invade Eriador. The Rangers fought many battles trying\nto hold them back, but one party managed to reach the Shire, and were\nfought off by a party of brave Hobbits under Bandobras Took in T.A.\n2747. Soon after, the Long Winter arrived and many lives were lost, and\nGandalf and the Rangers had to help the Hobbits of the Shire survive.\n\nIn 2911, during Argonui's rule, the Fell Winter began with the\nBrandywine freezing over. This was a catalyst for White Wolves invading\nEriador from the North which must have harassed the Rangers. In the last\nyear of his reign, great floods devastated Enedwaith and Minhiriath\nleaving Tharbad ruined and deserted. The following years were peaceful\nalthough Arador was killed by hill-trolls and his son Arathorn II was\nkilled while hunting orcs.\n\nArathorn's son, Aragorn II succeeded him, who between 2957 to 2980 took\ngreat journeys, serving in the armies of King Thengel of Rohan, and\nSteward Ecthelion II of Gondor. Many of his tasks weakened Sauron and\nhis allies, and the West endured him during the War of the Ring.\n\nAt that time Aragorn's Rangers were scattered and diminished. When\nHalbarad led a troop of the Rangers into the south to Aragorn's aid in\nthe War, in haste he could muster no more than thirty in this company\nwho fought in the Battle of Pelennor Fields.\n\nAragorn eventually became King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom and the\nRangers became once more a united people under the line of Elendil in\nthe Fourth Age.\n\nFor over a thousand years, the Rangers of the North faithfully preserved\nthe Line of Elendil and the ways of the Dúnedain and the ancient\nheirlooms of the Heir of Isildur such as the Shards of Narsil, Star of\nElendil, Sceptre of Annúminas, and the Ring of Barahir. Like all\nDúnedain, they were very friendly with the Elves, particularly those of\nRivendell, where each heir would be born and raised. They secretly\nguarded and protected Eriador, from spies and invaders, brigands, and\nother worse foes.\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring, the Rangers of the North were led by\nAragorn, future king of the reunited kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor. But\ndespite Aragorn's leadership, most of the Rangers remained scattered and\ndiminished. Therefore, when the ranger Halbarad endeavored to aid\nAragorn in the War, he could muster only a small number of Rangers to\njoin him."

Under the\nleadership of Ingwë, the Vanyar were the first to set forth on the Great\nJourney and the first to reach the shores of Belegaer; they sailed to\nAman on the first voyage of Tol Eressëa and remained there permanently.\n\n\n\nThe Vanyar are the fairest of all the elves hence their name: the FAIR\nELVES. Unlike the others who were attracted to the sea or the building\nand forging of things, the Vanyar culture seemed to revolve about Valar\nand Valinor. This is probably the reason why they choose to stay in\nValinor proper centered around Taniquetil, the seat of the rulers of\nArda, and loved the light of Valinor best of all the other places in\nAman and the wisdom of the Valar, and why they were favored by Manwë and\nVarda and always distrusted Melkor. They are known to have had the\ngreatest skill in poetry of all the Elves, likened to Manwë who loves\nthem for it. Their hair colour was golden and their banners white.\n\nIngwë was their king.\n\n\nHistory\n\nVanyar are descendants of Imin, the first Elf to awake at Cuiviénen, his\nwife Iminyë, and six other pairs of Elves who were awoken by them.\nImin's companions, Tata and Enel, later awoke groups of nine and twelve\npairs respectively, and Imin decided that since his group was now the\nsmallest and each group that he and his companions discovered was larger\nthan the last, he would now choose third rather than first in order to\nmake up the numbers. However, only a further two groups were discovered,\nleaving Imin's group of fourteen by far the smallest of the three Elven\nclans.\n\nWhen the Elves were discovered by Oromë, each clan chose an ambassador\nto return with him to Valinor to verify his claims of its greatness. The\nMinyar (Imin's companions) sent Ingwë. Upon his return, his people were\nswayed by his testimony and adopted him as their king (appropriate, as\nthe name Ingwë means chieftain in Quenya), and he led them with Oromë to\nAman. Ingwë has since been reckoned the High King of all Elves, and\nbecame known as Ingwë Ingweron, the “Chief of Chieftains”, and his\npeople were known by the rest of the Eldar as the Vanyar. In Aman the\nVanyar first dwelt in Tirion. Later, they came to love the full light of\nthe Trees and wandered into Valinor or settled on Taniquetil. He dwells\nwith them on the slopes of Taniquetil, beneath the halls of Manwë.\n\nAfter arriving in Aman, the Vanyar were rarely seen even by other Elves.\nVery few individual Vanyar are named besides Imin, Ingwë, his sister (or\npossibly niece) Indis, and Amarië, who was in love with Finrod Felagund.\n\n☀, Indis, the second wife of Finwë, the High King of the Ñoldor and the\nmother of both Fingolfin and Finarfin, the latter of which founded the\nonly house of Noldorin Elves to sport golden Vanyarin hair. After her\nhusband was killed by Melkor in his attack on Formenos to attain the\nSilmarils , she returned to her people with her daughter Findis.\n\nUnlike the Noldor, the Vanyar loved the light of Valinor so much that\nthey never choose to return to Middle-earth save when many of the Vanyar\nmarched in the War of Wrath with the Host of Valinor. Though they\npreferred the peaceful light of Valinor, the Vanyar were skilled in the\narts of war and were known for their fashioning of spears, thus they\nno doubt fielded a formidable army in the war. Ingwë's son led an armed\nhost of his people from Valinor to fight in the War of Wrath. They\nreturned to Aman, along with most of the Eldar living in the now largely\ndestroyed Beleriand, at the end of the First Age.\n\n\nRelations\n\nGaladriel was the granddaughter of Indis. It is to her Vanyarin blood\nthat Galadriel owes her famous silver-gold hair.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Vanyar_ means 'Fair-ones' in Quenya , referring to their\ngolden hair. The Vanyar often called themselves MINYAR; IPA: ; “Firsts”;\nsingular MINYA; adjectival MINYARIN; ), their ancient name. This ancient\nname does not still refer to any of the Avari who remained in\nMiddle-earth, since all of the Vanyar heeded the call of the Valar to\ncome to Valinor.\n\n\nOther Versions of the Legendarium\n\nIn the earliest versions of Tolkien's mythology (see: _The History of\nMiddle-earth_), they were called INGWI, as they were the people of\nIngwë, the High King of the Elves.\n\n\nGallery\n\nImage:Indis the Fair by vigshane.jpg|Indis the Fair, the wife of Finwë,\nthe first High King of the Ñoldor and Queen of the Ñoldor, by Filat\nImage:Amarie of the vanyar by Filat.jpg|Amarie, the love of Finrod, by\nFilat"

    "text": "The AKALLABÊTH is the fourth part of _The Silmarillion_, and the primary\naccount of the downfall of Númenor_._ It is relatively short, consisting\nof about thirty pages.\n\nThe story is written in the voice of Pengolodh, and is one of the more\nsignificant stories associated with Ælfwine.\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nAkallabêth (_The Downfallen_ in Adûnaic; Quenya is ''Atalantë;\n''Mar-nu-Falmar as another Quenya name.) is the story of the destruction\nof the Kingdom of Númenor, as written by Elendil. At the end of the\nFirst Age (described in detail in the _Quenta Silmarillion_), those of\nMen who had been helping Elves in their fight against Melkor were given\na new small continent of their own, free from the evil and sadness of\nMiddle-earth. It was located in the middle of the Great Ocean, between\nthe western shores of Middle-earth, and the eastern shores of Aman,\nwhere the Valar dwelt.\n\nAs they entered Númenor, the race of Men was forbidden to set sail\ntowards Aman, they gladly agreed to this because they regarded mortality\nas a gift and did not envy the Valar and Elves who could not die. For\ntwo and a half thousand years Númenor grew in might; Númenórian ships\nsailed the seas and established remote colonies, some of them in\nMiddle-earth. During that time the Elves of Middle-earth were engaged in\na bitter fight with Morgoth's former servant Sauron, who had turned into\na Dark Lord himself. The Elves asked for the help of the Númenórians and\nthey agreed but as time went on, over the course of one and half\nthousand years, Men desired immortality and rebelled against the Valar\nand the Elves. Their second last king, Tar Palantir, tried to amend the\nevil but it was too late. During this time, Númenor grew even more\npowerful.\n\nThe last king, Ar-Pharazôn, wanted control of Middle-earth, and so he\nattacked Sauron. Sauron's armies became afraid of the might of Númenor,\nand so he was captured and brought imprisoned to the Númenórian king.\nHowever, Sauron exploited his power to corrupt the Númenorian king to\nhis will. Soon he became his adviser, and much of Númenor obeyed his\nwill and worshipped Morgoth. Sauron convinced Ar-Pharazôn to try to\nassail Aman for immortality, desiring to destroy Númenor with the wrath\nof the Valar. However as this was done, the Valar appealed to Eru\nIlúvatar. Eru destroyed the Númenórian host, by crushing it under\nstones; however, he also caused the whole of Númenor to sink under the\nGreat Ocean. Just a few men of Númenórian royal blood, descendants of a\nlong line called “The Faithful” because they were uncorrupted by Sauron,\nhad fled Númenor by ships earlier with some gifts that Men received from\nthe Valar and the Elves in times of peace. They were led by Elendil the\nTall, and his two sons: Isildur and Anárion.\n\nThey set sail to Middle-earth, where the followers of Elendil\nestablished two kingdoms, which were managed as Númenórian provinces:\nGondor in the south and Arnor in the North. Some of the King's Men,\nenemies of Elendil, established other realms in exile to the south; of\nthese Umbar was the chief. The culture of Númenor became the dominant\nculture of Middle-earth (thus, Westron, a descendant of the Adûnaic\nlanguage of Númenor became the lingua franca). The sadness and the shock\nfrom the loss of a whole continent lived ever after in the hearts of\nkings of Númenórian descent. Arda was made spherical, and Aman was put\nfurther beyond Middle-earth, out of the reach of mortal men. Sauron,\nalthough greatly diminished and bereft of shape, escaped Númenor and\nreturned to Middle-earth once more.\n\n\nTextual history\n\nThe story originated with _The Lost Road_, an abandoned time-travel\nnovel. It was later adapted into back-story for _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nAs the Quenya name makes obvious, this is a retelling of the story of\nthe lost city of Atlantis, in the Middle-earth cadre. “Atalantë” is\nQuenya for “Downfallen”.\n\n\nCanon\n\nChristopher Tolkien notes in _The Peoples of Middle-earth_ that in the\nfinal version of Akallabêth, written by his father, the work is written\nin the voice of Pengolodh, and that the story was originally addressed\nto Ælfwine by him.\n\n    The authentic text began: “Of Men, Ælfwine, it is said by the Eldar\n    that they came into the world in the time of the Shadow of Morgoth\n    ...”\n\nChristopher then admits that this removal made the whole source lose its\nanchorage in Eldarin lore, and he believed he used poor judgment and\nexcessive vigilance, which also led him to alterations of the end of the\nparagraph (perhaps editorial work that was not his to properly make, as\nhe went against his father's original intent). Christopher also points\nout that the last paragraph of Akallabêth, as published in _The\nSilmarillion_, still contains indirect references to Ælfwine, the\n'Straight Road' and other 'future mariners', which he never altered or\nremoved."

    "text": "The BATTLE OF FORNOST was the decisive battle between the forces of\nAngmar, under the Witch-king, and of Eärnur, the Crown Prince of Gondor,\nin the year TA 1975 that ended the evil northern Kingdom of Angmar.\n\n\nHistory\n\nA year prior to the battle, the armies of Angmar conquered Arthedain,\nthe last realm of Arnor. Angmar's armies had taken Fornost, the capital\nof the Dúnedain, and Arvedui, the last King of Arnor, had drowned in the\nIce-Bay of Forochel. A year later, a fleet of ships under Eärnur arrived\nin the Grey Havens and set off toward what was left of the once-great\nnorthern kingdom. With the armies of Gondor came men from Rhovanion,\nelves from Lindon, and the remainder of the Dúnedain (among them\nAranarth, the Prince of Arthedain). According to Shire historians, a\ncompany of archers was also sent to the battle.\n\nThe battle itself did not take place in the city of Fornost, but on the\nplains to the west of the city, near Lake Evendim. The armies of Angmar\nhurried west to meet the assault, and seeing this, the cavalry of Gondor\nrode north into the Hills of Evendim to wait in ambush. As the main part\nof the army of Gondor met the enemy in battle, the Gondor cavalry set\nout from the hills to strike the rear of the army of Angmar. This served\nas the turning point in the battle, and allowed the combined armies of\nthe west to gain the advantage. Realizing that his forces were all but\ncompletely destroyed, the Witch-king of Angmar fled eastward. As he\nfled, an army led by Glorfindel came up out of the south and blocked his\nescape, destroying what was left of his crumbling army; the Witch-king\nhimself was able to escape during the night and fled southward. Though\nthe battle itself had been lost and Angmar utterly destroyed, Sauron was\nextremely pleased with the Witch-King's work, for the destruction of the\nnorthern kingdoms of the Dúnedain was a victory for the Dark Powers\nwhich far exceeded the loss of the Witch-King's realm."

The three\npeaks that were part of Khazad-dûm were Caradhras (Redhorn), Celebdil\n(Silvertine) and Fanuidhol (Cloudyhead). Inside Celebdil, the Dwarves\nbuilt the Endless Stair, from the foundations of the mountain to the top\nof it. The southernmost peak of the Misty Mountains was Methedras,\nmeaning “the Last Peak”.\n\nRoutes through the Misty Mountains\n\nThe most important passes were the High Pass and the Redhorn Pass. There\nwas also a pass at the source of the Gladden river.\n\nRoutes around the Misty Mountains\n\nThe Gap of Rohan was the valley (probably of the River Isen) between the\nsouthernmost peaks of the Misty Mountains and the northernmost of the\nWhite Mountains. There may have been a gap between Mount Gundabad in the\nMisty Mountains and the westernmost extremity of the Grey Mountains,\nthough published maps differ on this point. \n\nInhabitants\n\nUnder the Misty Mountains were the former Dwarf realm of Khazad-dum, and\nthe “Goblin-town” in which Bilbo Baggins stumbled across the One Ring,\nwhich had been in the possession of the creature Gollum, who also dwelt\nthere himself on the eastern side. Rivendell was hidden in the foothills\nof the Misty Mountains at the western end of the High Pass.\n\nCarn Dûm, where the Witch-King of Angmar resided for several centuries\nin the Third Age, lay between a western spur of the northern extreme of\nthe range, known as the Mountains of Angmar. Mount Gundabad, the largest\nGoblin dwelling in the Misty Mountains, was located south-east of\nAngmar.\n\nIsengard lay centered around the Tower of Orthanc in Nan Curunír, the\nvalley between the arms of Methedras, which was the southernmost peak of\nthe Misty Mountains. The “stone-giants” also inhabited this mountain\nrange, as told in _The Hobbit_.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Misty Mountains were created by Melkor during the Time of the Trees,\nwho wanted to make it difficult for Oromë, who often rode across\nMiddle-earth hunting his fell beasts, to pass.\n\nYears of the Trees\n\nThe Dwarves of Durin awoke under Mount Gundabad and later established\nthe caves of Khazad-dûm. Later, when the Elves on their Great Journey to\nValinor looked upon their terrible height a portion of the Teleri, later\nknown as the Nandor grew afraid and turned south down the Great River.\nThousands of years later, the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth and\nestablished great realms in the Beleriand and in the highlands, but they\nnever crossed the mountains or established realms within them.\n\nFirst and Second Ages\n\nOver three-hundred years into the First Age, the tribes of Men crossed\nthe Misty Mountains and began migrating into the Beleriand, first the\nEdain and then later the Easterlings or Swarthy Men. After the defeat of\nMorgoth, the surviving orcs and a Balrog came to live there and would\nremain a problem for over six-thousand years. The Easterling men who\nfought with Morgoth crossed the mountains and began living east of the\nWilderland in Rhûn. The Great Eagles also began living here in a place\nknown as the Eagles Eyrie.\n\nThe great Dwarven realm of Khazad-dûm beneath the Misty Mountains\nthrived as good relations with the Ñoldor of Eregion were established,\nuntil Sauron invaded Eriador from Mordor and the east destroying Eregion\nand ravaging the lands beyond. The dwarves survived by shutting\nthemselves in Khazad-dûm behind the Doors of Durin.\n\nThird Age\n\nIn TA 1980, the great Dwarven realm of Khazad-dûm came to an end when\nthe Dwarves unearthed a Balrog which led to its desertion by TA 1981,\nafter which it was known as Moria (literally, “black chasm”). Slowly,\nthe Misty Mountains became increasingly perilous and dangerous to\ntravelers as Goblins and other creatures came to dwell under there.\n\nAlmost a thousand years later, the thirteen Dwarves, Gandalf, and Bilbo\nBaggins used the High Pass to cross the Misty Mountains during the Quest\nfor the Lonely Mountain, and were captured by Goblins whilst crossing.\nUnder the mountains, the Great Goblin was slain, and Bilbo found the One\nRing.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring tried to cross the Redhorn Pass (after\nrejecting the High Pass leading to Rhovanion as being watched by the\nEnemy, and the Gap of Rohan as taking the Fellowship too close to\nIsengard), but a blizzard forced it to go under the mountain instead of\nover it. They faced a Balrog that dwelt in the deserted realm of\nKhazad-dûm. Gandalf slew the Balrog by casting it down from Zirakzigil,\nbut it had worn his life already, and on that high ground he lay until\nGwaihir bore him to Lothlorien.",

    "page_id": "2355",
    "text": "DORIATH (Sindarin IPA: ) (aka ARTANOR\") was an Elven realm, the land\nof the Sindar that existed during the latter-half of the Years of the\nTrees and most of the First Age of the Sun. For thousands of years it\nwas separate from the outside world under the rule of King Thingol and\nthe protection of his wife Melian the Maia, until it was drawn into the\nwar against Morgoth and the doom that lay on the Ñoldor, because of the\nOath of Fëanor.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nDoriath was located in the middle of Beleriand, between Ered Gorgoroth\n(Mountains of Terror) from the north and the Andram from south, and\nTalath Dirnen from the west, and Estolad from the east. It was a realm\nof forests about the great river Sirion; within it were the forests\n_Neldoreth_ (also _Taur-na-Neldor_, the northern beech forest), _Nivrim_\n(also West-march, an oak forest), and _Region_ (pronounced Reh-gi-on,\nthe main forest). Additionally, the forests of _Brethil_ and ''Nan\nElmoth ''were considered to be under the influence of Thingol, though\nnot under his direct command and laying outside of the Girdle of Melian.\nEöl the Dark Elf leased Nan Elmoth from Thingol, having paid with the\nsword Anglachel. The People of Haleth, or the Haladin, lived in Brethil\nwith the permission of Thingol. They governed themselves, but cooperated\nwith the march-wardens of Doriath. King Elu Thingol of Doriath, also\nHigh King of the Sindar, saw all of Beleriand as his realm, from the\nGelion to the Belegaer (the Sea).\n\n\nHistory\n\nYears of the Trees\n\nThe Vanyar and Ñoldor had passed by it on the Great Journey, and had\nbeen ferried across on Tol Eressëa by the time the Teleri arrived. Then\ntheir lord Elwë was lost in Nan Elmoth, and when Ulmo returned for them,\na part remained behind. They became known as the Sindar or Grey Elves,\nand when Thingol returned he became their king, ruling from Doriath.\n\nThe forests of Neldoreth and Region were located in the center of\nBeleriand, and were the abode of King Thingol and Melian. Their people\nwere the people of the Teleri who did not heed the call of the Valar to\npass over the sea to Valinor. All the Elves of Beleriand, from the\nshipbuilders under Círdan in the Falas, to the hunters of the Blue\nMountains, held Thingol as their lord. During the First and Second Ages\nof the Chaining of Melkor, Beleriand was peaceful. However, by the end\nof the First Age, Melian forebode that evil was to come, and Thingol\ncalled on the aid of the Dwarves of Belegost to aid in constructing a\ncity-fortress for the protection of his people. They also helped make\nfor them a store of stronger and better weapons that were better able to\ndeal with the Orcs of north. This was built under ground along the\nsouthern side of the River Esgalduin, and was called Menegroth, which\nbecame Thingol's capital.\n\nFor the most part, the Elves lived in scattered bands throughout\nBeleriand, only gathering in larger numbers in Neldoreth and Region\n(together called Eglador), and along the Falas. During the Third Age of\nthe Chaining of Melkor, Thingol proceeded to arm his people with the aid\nof the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost against the continued foreboding\nof Melian.\n\nAfter Melkor's release, his attack on the Two Trees with Ungoliant, and\nflight to Middle-earth, the situation for Beleriand suddenly worsened.\nUngoliant fled south from the Balrogs after her confrontation with\nMelkor, now Morgoth, and was only checked by the power of Melian. Some\ntime after, the forces of Morgoth left the freshly delved Angband and\nassaulted Beleriand from east and west in the First Battle of Beleriand.\nIn the east, King Thingol lead the forces of Beleriand, with the aid of\nDenethor and his Nandor and elves from Ossiriand, and completely\ndefeated the Orcs of the eastern army. Denethor was killed on Amon Ereb,\nand some of his people merged themselves to the Sindarin Elves under\nKing Thingol. Upon returning to Menegroth, Thingol learned that the\nwestern army of Morgoth had overrun the Falas. Thingol recalls all of\nhis people he can into Neldoreth and Region, and Melian puts forth her\npower and rings the region in a girdle of enchantment called the Girdle\nof Melian. At that point, the region formally called Eglador comes to be\nformally known as Doriath, the Guarded Kingdom.\n\nThe First Battle is the only time King Thingol leads his forces into\nbattle outside of his realm for the entirety of the First Age of the\nSun. Afterwards, the Elves of Doriath fight defensively, guarding their\nborders and the important river crossings nearby.\n\nFirst Age\n\n\n\nWhen the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth at the beginning of the First\nAge, Thingol refused to allow them in Doriath, with the exception of the\nchildren of Finarfin, who were related to him by his brother Olwë.\n\nWhen later Men arrived in Beleriand, they were also refused entry, but\nat Finrod's request the Haladin gives his permission for the People of\nHaleth to dwell in Brethil, who ally themselves with Doriath and aid\nthem in its defense.\n\nThroughout the rest of the First Age, while the Noldor fight their wars\nwith Morgoth, Doriath stands inviolate and generally aloof, refusing to\ntake part in the wars. Ultimately, however, King Thingol is pulled into\nthe doom surround the Noldor as was told in the Lay of Leithian, when\nBeren, son of Barahir and lord of the First House of Men, passed through\nthe Girdle as Melian had foretold, and arrived in Neldoreth.\n\nRealizing that his beloved daughter Lúthien had fallen in love with him,\nKing Thingol decreed that he would not allow them to marry unless Beren\nwould undertake a quest to recover a Silmaril from the Dark Lord\nMorgoth, and so begins the Quest for the Silmarils. After the Quest for\nthe Silmaril, the Wolf Carcharoth also breached the Girdle, but Thingol,\nBeren, and Thingol's captains Beleg and Mablung hunted and killed the\nbeast.\n\nAt the end of this, Thingol ended up in possession of one of the\nSilmarils. Beren and Lúthien, wedded together by fate and returning from\nthe dead, left Doriath to live in Ossiriand. After the Nirnaeth\nArnoediad, only three elven kingdoms remained: Nargothrond, Gondolin,\nand Doriath. Nargothrond fell soon after, as told in the _Narn i Chîn\nHúrin_ (Tale of the Children of Hurin).\n\nFearing that the cruel Easterlings would enthrall her only\nson Túrin of Hithlum, Morwen sent him to Doriath where he would be safe\nuntil he came of age, when he fled from the land. Later his mother and\nsister, Morwen and Nienor lived there, until they were lost.\n\nHurin, captured at the Nirnaeth and released from Angband after the\ndeath of his son Turin, recovers the Nauglamir from the ruin of\nNargothrond. Traveling to Doriath, he throws it at the feet of Thingol\nin spite. Melian rebukes him, and Hurin, cured of the madness of Morgoth\nby Melian, lifts up the Nauglamir and presents it to Thingol before\nleaving Doriath, and vanishing from history.\n\nFall of Doriath\n\nHúrin brought the treasure of Nargothrond to Doriath after the fall of\nFinrod's realm, and Thingol enlisted the Dwarves of Nogrod to combine\nthe Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien with the Nauglamir, the Dwarves'\nNecklace. The Dwarves then attacked Thingol and slew him, stealing the\nnecklace, during the first Sack of Doriath. Melian then left, and with\nher, the protective Girdle thus ended the bliss of old that reigned in\nDoriath for thousands of years, and things would never be the same\nagain.\n\nThingol, in possession of the greatest work of the Elves (a Silmaril of\nFëanor) and Dwarves (the Nauglamir) decides to merge the two. He\nconvinces a large company of smiths from Nogrod to attempt to remake the\nNauglamir to incorporate the Silmaril, which they succeed in doing. Once\nthe work is complete, and the joint works of Elves and Dwarves sits\nglittering before Thingol, he moves to take it and put it on. The\nDwarves stop him, demanding it in payment. Thingol rebukes them with\nhaughty words, at which the Dwarves slay him. The Dwarves attempt to\nescape Doriath, but most are killed and the Nauglamir recovered. After\nThingol's death, Melian departs Doriath in grief and withdraws her power\nfrom Doriath. After telling Mablung to send word to Beren, she vanishes\nfrom Middle-earth and returns to Valinor. Doriath now lies\nundefended.\n\nTwo Dwarves return from Doriath and tell a twisted version of the events\nto their king in Nogrod. The Dwarves of Nogrod raise an army and assault\nDoriath in retaliation. The slaughter is great on both sides, but the\nDwarves end up victorious. Menegroth is ransacked, many of its people\nare killed, and the Dwarves begin the long trek for home laden with the\nspoils of war, including the Nauglamir. At Sarn Athrad, they are\nassaulted by a force of Green Elves led by Beren who, with the aid of\nthe Ents of Ossiriand, annihilate the Dwarven force and recover the\nSilmaril.\n\nDior Eluchîl, son of Beren and Lúthien and heir to Thingol, returns to\nDoriath with his wife Nimloth, their two sons Eluréd and Elurín, and\ntheir daughter Elwing. He begins to rebuild the fortunes of the kingdom\nand it is briefly restored. Beren takes the Nauglamir to Lúthien, who\nwears it, enriching their home on Tol Galen. However, Beren and Lúthien\nsoon die for the second time, leaving the world forever. The Nauglamir\nand its Silmaril are brought to Dior.\n\nSoon after, the Sons of Fëanor, following the Oath, demand the return of\nthe Silmaril. Dior refuses, and the Sons of Fëanor invade Doriath, at\nwhich point the Second Kinslaying occurs. Celegorm, Curufin, and\nCaranthir are killed, as is Dior, Nimloth, and Eluréd and Elurín. The\npeople of Doriath are killed or scattered, with Elwing taking the\nNauglamir and fleeing with a remnant of the people of Doriath to the\nMouths of Sirion.\n\nDoriath was never rebuilt and afterwards Doriath remained abandoned and\nunpopulated until it was sunk along with most of the rest of\nBeleriand.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Sindarin, _Doriath_ means “Land of the Fence”, from _dôr_ (“land”)\nand _iâth_ (“fence”). Its previous name _EGLADOR_ either means “Land of\nthe Forsaken” or “Land of the Elves”, because the inhabitants called\nthemselves “Eglath”. The High Elves called Doriath the “Land of the\nCave”, from the Ñoldorin _gath_ or _gatta_ (“cavern”)\n\n_GARTHÚRIAN_ was name ascribed to the land of Doriath in earlier\nversions of the accounts of the First Age (specifically in _The War of\nthe Jewels_)_._",

    "text": "The EDAIN (sing. ADAN) also known as ATANATÁRI, FATHERS OF MEN, and_'\nThree Houses of Men_', are a group of Men that came to the Beleriand\nfrom the Far East during the First Age.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the early fourth century of the First Age the Edain, drawn towards\nthe Light of the West, came into Beleriand where they befriended the\nelves, entered their service, received land and title for that service,\nand fought valiantly in the Battles of Beleriand. Some, however,\nremained in Estolad or fled south or east from the power of Dark Lord\nMorgoth, and passed from history until the Third Age. Despite their\nmighty heroes, the Edain were decimated by the hordes of Morgoth, but\none of their numbers, Eärendil of the House of Hador, sailed to Aman and\nobtained from the Valar the aid by which Morgoth was defeated in the\nLast Battle. The remnant of the Edain, now increased in body and mind by\nEönwë, then sailed to Númenor and became known as Númenóreans and later\nthe Dúnedain who came to live in Middle-earth in the Realms in Exile\nafter the Fall of Númenor.\n\n\nThree Houses of Man\n\nThey were divided into three tribes, or “Houses”:\n\n1.) The HOUSE OF BËOR: they were dark-haired and stoutly built, and most\nresembled the Ñoldor of all Elves. They were first discovered by Finrod\nFelagund, Lord of Nargothrond, and under his guidance later made their\nway to the lands of the Ñoldorin lord Amrod, in a place later known as\nEstolad, the Encampment. They remained loyal to the House of Finarfin,\nand later settled in the lands of Dorthonion.\n\n2.) The Second House, later known as the HALADIN or the HOUSE OF HALETH:\nThey were a reclusive folk, dark-haired but smaller in stature than the\nBëorians. They usually kept separate from the other Men, and were later\ngranted permission to settle in the Forest of Brethil, part of Doriath.\nThey mostly kept out of the wars.\n\n3.) The HOUSE OF MARACH, later best known as the HOUSE OF HADOR: They\nwere originally led by Marach but later took the name of Hador in honor\nof him. Tall and golden-haired, they most resembled the Vanyar of the\nelves. They were a very numerous and war-like tribe, and the Green Elves\nof Ossiriand feared them. They first settled in Estolad, then in the\nsouthern parts of Ered Wethrin (Mountains of Shadow), and then later in\nDor-lómin. They were loyal to Fingolfin.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nThe Edain were tall, fair, and strong; their spirits were noble, they\nwere fierce in war, and they shunned all dealings with evil. In\nBeleriand the Edain loved the Eldar, from whom they learned much wisdom,\nand they were further ennobled by the two marriages of Elda and Adan:\nBeren and Lúthien and Tuor and Idril. The lifespan of the Edain before\nthey entered Beleriand was probably about 70 years; in Beleriand, it was\nlengthened to 90, but few of the Edain lived to old age in peace.\n\n\nLanguage\n\nThe language of the Edain (at least those of the First and Third Houses)\nwas related to Adûnaic, but in Beleriand, most of the Edain spoke\nSindarin, and so the tongue of the Haladin was alien to them.\n\n\nFate of the Edain\n\nThe House of Bëor was nearly wiped out by Morgoth, and the remainder of\nits people merged with the Hadorians and became the Númenóreans. It\nwould seem that the Haladin of Beleriand were completely wiped out, or\nat least disappeared as a separate people.\n\nWhen they returned as Númenóreans to Middle-earth in the Second Age,\nthey encountered many men who were obviously related to the Atani: they\nclassified these men as _Middle Men_, and established friendly relations\nwith them. Examples are the Rohirrim, the Men of Dale, and the\nBreelanders.\n\nOther men, such as the Dunlendings, were not recognised as Middle Men\nbecause they were related to the Haladin rather than Bëorians or\nMarachians, and they were hostile to Númenor.\n\nA fourth kind of men came with the Second House, and called themselves\n_Drughu_. This name was adopted in Sindarin as _Drúedain_:\n_Drû_+_Edain_. They were a strange people, living with the Haladin in\nthe forest of Brethil, some even apparently made it to Númenor, but they\ndied out or had left before the Akallabêth. In the Third Age, their far\nkin were known as the _Woses_ of the Drúadan Forest. They had dwindled\nto a very small number and were secretive but were renowned for the\nassistance they gave to the Rohirrim in the War of the Ring.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe Sindarin word _Edain_, singular _Adan_ (Quenya _Atani_, _Atan_),\nliterally meant _Second People_, and originally referred to all men, but\nlater it only applied to the Men of Beleriand and their descendants. The\nQuenya term _Atani_ kept its old meaning."

The QUENTA SILMARILLION is\nthe third part of the _The Silmarillion._\n\n_Quenta Silmarillion_ is the largest final-rendition account of the\nFirst Age, and its stories narrate all of that Age's major events.\n\n\nContents\n\n-   Of the Beginning of Days\n-   Of Aulë and Yavanna\n-   Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\n-   Of Thingol and Melian\n-   Of Eldamar and the Princes of the Eldalië\n-   Of Fëanor and the Unchaining of Melkor\n-   Of the Silmarils and the Unrest of the Noldor\n-   Of the Darkening of Valinor\n-   Of the Flight of the Noldor\n-   Of the Sindar\n-   Of the Sun and Moon and the Hiding of Valinor\n-   Of Men\n-   Of the Return of the Noldor\n-   Of Beleriand and its Realms\n-   Of the Noldor in Beleriand\n-   Of Maeglin\n-   Of the Coming of Men into the West\n-   Of the Ruin of Beleriand and the Fall of Fingolfin\n-   Of Beren and Lúthien\n-   Of the Fifth Battle: Nirnaeth Arnoediad\n-   Of Túrin Turambar\n-   Of the Ruin of Doriath\n-   Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin\n-   Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nTolkien envisaged _The Silmarillion_ as deriving from a manuscript\nwritten by an Eriol or Ælfwine of England; an imaginary Dark Age source\nfor the material, which itself contains little or no reference to the\npeople or events of the Second or Third Ages of his legendarium.\nOriginated from Elvish legends, in some parts it presents Elves as long\ngone, which hints that its final form was edited during the Fourth Age\nby Hobbits and/or Men.\n\nIt tells about the history of Arda (the Earth), after its creation by\nEru Ilúvatar. The Valar, angelic beings, enter into the world and try to\nshape it after a vision given to them by Eru. The initial shape of Arda,\nchosen by the Valar, was of a symmetrical continent lit by the Two\nLamps. However, the lamps were destroyed by the vicious Melkor; Arda was\ndarkened, and the lamps' fall spoiled the symmetry of Arda's surface.\nTwo main continents were created that are of concern to the story: Aman\nin the west, and Middle-earth in the east.\n\nFollowing this, Melkor hid himself from the Valar in his fortress Utumno\nin the north of Middle-earth. He also surrounded himself with horrible\nbeasts, many of them Maia in the form of fell animals, known as Balrogs.\n\nThe Valar moved to the western continent Aman where they established the\nrealm Valinor of which Manwë was made king. The Vala Yavanna created the\nTwo Trees which illuminated Valinor. Middle-earth, by contrast, was in\nperpetual darkness, and was seldom visited by the Valar. Only some of\nthem, most notably Oromë, visited it periodically, especially to prepare\nfor the coming of the Elves, which the Valar had foreseen in their\nvision and to keep an eye on Melkor's activities.\n\nIntroduction of the Elves\n\nOn one of his expeditions Oromë discovered the newly-awakened Elves at\nCuiviénen. The Valar, aware of the risk Melkor posed to the Elves,\nbeleaguered his fortress and finally overthrew him and took him prisoner\nto Valinor to serve “three ages” in the Halls of Mandos.\n\nOromë was then sent to the Elves again, to invite them to come with him\nto Aman and live there. Some of the Elves did not follow him or became\nsidetracked and stayed in Middle-earth, and so the Elves became\nsundered. These notably included the Sindar, who stayed in Middle-earth\nwhen their king, Thingol, became lost in the forest. He was to later\nemerge, married to the Maia Melian, and found the Kingdom of Doriath.\n\nThe Elves who accepted the summons were carried across the sea on a\nfloating island.\n\nThe Noldor and Melkor\n\nFinwë, the first High King of the Ñoldor, had a son Fëanor. At his birth\nFëanor drew so much life from his mother Míriel that she grew weary of\nlife and her spirit left her bodily form, departing to the halls of\nMandos. Eventually, Finwë married Indis and had two further sons,\nFingolfin and Finarfin. Fëanor became the most famous Elven craftsman,\nespecially by making the Silmarils, three jewels in which he trapped the\nlight of the Two Trees. The Silmarils were hallowed by Varda, and would\nburn any evil or mortal creature who touched them.\n\nAbout this time, Melkor, having completed his sentence, convinced the\nother Valar that he had reformed and he was released. By various lies he\nmanaged to play Fëanor and Fingolfin against each other, creating strife\nand division amongst the Noldor; furthermore, he convinced the Ñoldor\nthat they had been brought to Aman primarily so the Valar could keep\nthem under control. Finally, Fëanor rebelled against the Valar, publicly\nadvocating leaving and then drawing his weapon against Fingolfin.\n\nThe Valar were soon aware of Melkor's ultimate responsibility in this.\nTulkas hunted him, but Melkor had hidden and could not be found. Because\nhe threatened Fingolfin's life, Fëanor was exiled from Tirion for twelve\nyears. With his seven sons and his father Finwë he moved to a\nnewly-built stronghold, Formenos.\n\nCoveting the Silmarils, Melkor went to Formenos, hoping to trick Fëanor\nand gain possession of them, but Fëanor saw through his ruse and\ndismissed him with contempt. Melkor then traveled to Avathar in secret,\nwhere he joined forces with the evil spirit Ungoliant, whose form was a\ngiant spider-like creature. Melkor swore an oath to give Ungoliant\nwhatever she desired, and imparted some of his power to her. With her\nhelp, they traveled into Valinor secretly, where Ungoliant's poison\nkilled the Two Trees. Covered by an impenetrable blackness, Melkor and\nUngoliant then traveled to Formenos, assassinated Finwë and stole the\nSilmarils, before escaping in the confusion.\n\nMelkor and Ungoliant then made their way across to Middle-earth, and he\ngave Ungoliant all the great jewels he had stolen, except the Silmarils,\nwhich he desired to keep. The rapacious Ungoliant consumed them all and,\nstill hungry, she demanded the Silmarils, but the ever-treacherous\nMelkor reneged on his oath, so she seized him and bound him with her\nwebs, and his anguished cries echoed across all of Middle-earth.\n\nMelkor escaped from Ungoliant with the help of his former servants, the\nBalrogs, who came to his aid from their hiding places in the deepest\nrecesses of the ruins of Utumno, and he re-established his empire in the\nNorth from his secondary fortress of Angband. He placed the three\nSilmarils, which now were the only source of the unmarred light of the\nTwo Trees, in his Iron Crown, although his hands were burned black by\nthem.\n\nFëanor was furious at the death of his father and the theft of the\nSilmarils. Travelling to Tirion in violation of his exile, he publicly\nblamed both Melkor, whom he named Morgoth, and the Valar (for failing to\nprotect Finwë and the Silmarils). He urged the Noldor to leave Valinor,\nfor a punitive expedition against Morgoth and a new life in\nMiddle-earth. He and his sons then swore the notorious Oath of Fëanor,\nvowing to pursue with hatred anyone who withheld a Silmaril from them.\n\nDeparture of the Noldor and assault on Doriath\n\nInflamed by the passionate urging of Fëanor, most of the assembled\nÑoldor left Tirion, and traveled to Alqualondë, attempting to persuade\nthe Teleri to join them, or at least to lend them ships to cross the\nGreat Sea. When the Teleri refused, Fëanor ordered that the swan-ships\nbe taken by force; the notorious Kinslaying ensued, in which many Teleri\nwere slaughtered. Shortly afterwards, at the northern boundary of\nEldamar, the Noldor encountered Mandos, who cursed all the Ñoldor who\nleft with Fëanor .\n\nAt this point, Finarfin, who had always been reluctant to leave, turned\nback to Valinor with a small number of followers. Many ships had been\nlost by this time and not all the Ñoldor could cross to Middle-earth, so\nFëanor and his sons seized the remaining swan-ships, abandoning\nFingolfin and his followers (including Galadriel), who were obliged to\nmake their way to Middle-earth across the terrible ice wastes of the\nHelcaraxë. Approximately 2.2 million Noldor are said to have perished on\nthe Helcaraxë.\n\nMeanwhile, Morgoth attempted to conquer Doriath, the realm of Thingol\nand Melian in Middle-earth. In the first of five great Battles, he sent\nout two armies of Orcs, forcing Thingol and his Maia queen to establish\na magical boundary around Doriath, the “Girdle of Melian”, while the\ncoastal Elves were forced to retreat into their fortified harbour towns.\nBy luck, Fëanor and his host arrived at the height of this conflict and\nthe combined forces of the Ñoldor and the Sindar utterly defeated the\nOrc armies in the second Battle, Dagor-nuin-Giliath (Battle under the\nStars). However Fëanor, in his fury, chased after the retreating Orcs\nand he was ambushed and killed by Balrogs.\n\nThe Sun and the Moon, the Long Peace and the Coming of Men\n\nThe grieving Valar could not revive the Two Trees,because Fëanor would\nnot give up the silmarills which captured the light of the trees. But\nthey were able to create the Moon and the Sun from a silver leaf and a\ngolden fruit, which were all that remained of them. These new lights\nilluminated Middle-earth, stimulated much new plant and animal growth,\nand for a while, confounded the plans of Morgoth. Unable to assail them,\nas his once near-limitless power grew ever more dispersed among his\nservants, who feared the new lights no less than he, the Dark Lord was\nforced to take refuge in clouds and shadow that surrounded his\nstrongholds. In this era, Men, the younger Children of Ilúvatar, awoke\nin eastern Middle-earth, and some began to migrate westward.\n\nThe Ñoldor established kingdoms and principalities in northern and\ncentral Beleriand, which were ruled by the descendants of Fëanor,\nFingolfin and Finarfin. They built many great strongholds, including the\nvast cavern-city of Nargothrond, on the river Narog, and the mighty\nhidden mountain fortress of Gondolin, ruled by Turgon, from whence none\nwho entered were permitted to leave. Many of the Sindar, the native\nElves of Beleriand, were absorbed into the Ñoldorin kingdoms. Others\nwere in Sindarin states: Thingol's kingdom in Doriath, the coastal Falas\nruled by Círdan the shipwright, and the secretive Green-Elves of\nOssiriand.\n\nRelations between the Ñoldor and the independent Sindar were at first\namicable but they later deteriorated. The Ñoldor had long hidden the\ntruth about the Kinslaying and the Curse from Thingol, but he eventually\nlearned of it from Angrod. As a result he banned all the Ñoldor (except\nhis kin in the house of Finarfin) from entering Doriath, decreeing also\nthat the Noldorin tongue could no longer be spoken within his realm.\n\nA further rift between the Ñoldor and the Sindar, which was to have\nfar-reaching consequences, was caused by the actions of Aredhel,\ndaughter of Fingolfin and sister of Turgon. Tiring of her long\nconfinement in Gondolin, she rode east to seek out her old friends, the\nsons of Fëanor, but she was barred from crossing through Doriath by the\ndecree of Thingol. Forced to skirt along the edge of the dreaded region\nof Nan Dungortheb (where Ungoliant had gone after the escape of\nMorgoth), Aredhel was separated from her escort and lost. She was\neventually found by Eöl, the Dark Elf, a kinsman of Thingol who lived\nalone in the dark forest of Nan Elmoth. He took her as his wife, and\nthey had a son, Maeglin. Eöl often traveled east to deal with the\nDwarves of the Blue Mountains, and he acquired great skill in metalwork\nfrom them, which he imparted to his son. He refused to let his wife and\nchild leave his domain, but Aredhel determined to return to Gondolin\nwith her son, so they waited until Eöl left for the east and then made\ntheir escape.\n\nEöl pursued them to Gondolin, where he was captured and brought before\nTurgon. Eöl demanded that Maeglin should leave with him, or be cursed,\nbut Maeglin renounced his father. Turgon then decreed that Eöl must\neither remain in Gondolin or die. The next day, when he was again\nbrought before Turgon, Eöl tried to kill Maeglin with a poisoned lance,\nbut Aredhel stepped between them; struck in the shoulder, she died that\nnight. As punishment, Turgon had Eöl thrown to his death from the walls\nof the fortress. Maeglin remained in Gondolin, became a mighty warrior\nand wrought many great weapons, but his forbidden love for his cousin\nIdril Celebrindal would eventually cause him to betray Gondolin to\nMorgoth.\n\nAfter fifty years, and believing the Noldor to be unprepared for war,\nMorgoth again attacked the from the north, but Fingolfin and Maedhros\nwere ready for him and they defeated Morgoth's forces in the third\nBattle, called Dagor Aglareb, pursuing the Orcs to the very gates of\nAngband and destroying them utterly. They then laid the Siege of\nAngband, which lasted for four hundred years.\n\nAlmost one hundred years after the Dagor Aglareb, Morgoth's forces tried\nto attack the realm of Hithlum by stealing in from the far north-west,\nbut were intercepted and defeated by Fingon. After a further hundred\nyears, Morgoth sent forth the dragon Glaurung, the first of the\nFire-drakes. Being only half-grown and not fully armoured, Glaurung was\nunable to withstand Fingon and his archers, eventually fleeing back to\nAngband. The period after the first defeat of Glaurung became known as\nThe Long Peace, lasting almost two hundred years.\n\nIt was during this time, about three hundred years after the Noldor had\narrived in Beleriand, that Men first came into Middle-earth from the\nregions far to the east. They first appeared in Ossiriand, where\nFelagund was the first of the Noldor to see them. Over the next hundred\nyears many of them became allies of the Noldor in the war against\nMorgoth, and settled in Noldorin realms.\n\nThe Dagor Bragollach\n\nMorgoth, however, merely used the Siege as an opportunity to build up\nstrength, and in , renewed the war on his own terms. The fourth Great\nBattle, Dagor Bragollach became famous for the re-emergence of the\nDragon Glaurung in his full strength. Morgoth's armies overthrew the\nSiege, slaying many of the Noldor, with Glaurung laying waste to\nArd-galen and Dorthonion.\n\nEnraged by the assaults against his people, Fingolfin fearlessly made\nhis way alone to the gates of Angband, where he challenged Morgoth to\nsingle combat and the evil Vala was forced to come out and meet him\nrather than appear cowardly. In the ensuing battle Fingolfin wounded\nMorgoth seven times, but eventually stumbled and fell among the great\npits created by Morgoth's hammer, Grond. Morgoth beat Fingolfin to the\nground three times with his great shield, and then crushed Fingolfin\nunder his foot, but with his dying strength Fingolfin slashed Morgoth's\nfoot, maiming him.\n\nMorgoth broke Fingolfin's body and was about to throw the remains to his\nwolves, but Thorondor, the gigantic king of the eagles, had been\nwatching the battle from afar and at that moment flew down to rescue the\nbody. The giant eagle gouged Morgoth's face with his talons, seized\nFingolfin's body and carried it back to Gondolin for burial. After that\ntime Morgoth's seven wounds never healed, he became lame in his left\nfoot, where Fingolfin had hewn it, and his face forever bore the scars\nof Thorondor's talons.\n\nSixteen years later, Maedhros led the northern Ñoldor and their allies\namong Men in a final desperate attempt to defeat Morgoth. In this\nclimactic battle — which is named Nirnaeth Arnoediad— the forces of the\nÑoldor attacked Angband and briefly broke through the gates, only to be\nbeaten back when Morgoth unleashed his full forces, now vastly\noutnumbering those of Elves and Men. Led by the terrible dragon\nGlaurung, Morgoth's forces crushed the armies of the Ñoldor, and many of\nthe elf lords were killed or captured, leaving Morgoth master of the\nentire North. Afterwards, he set about destroying the remaining\nElf-kingdoms one by one.\n\nThe Dagor Bragollach was the battle in which Gil-galad left Hithlum for\nthe Havens of the Falas.\n\nBeren and Lúthien\n\nThe later parts of the _Quenta Silmarillion_ include two stories dealing\nwith individuals and with the relations between Men and Elves.\n\nThe tragic yet heroic story of Beren and Lúthien (which has similarities\nto the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice) tells of the love between the Man\nBeren and Lúthien, daughter of Thingol and Melian and the most beautiful\nof all Elf Maidens. Thingol, disliking mortal Men and determined to\nprevent their marriage, declares that he will consent only if Beren\nbrings Thingol a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown. Thus, in sending Beren\non this perilous quest, Thingol unwittingly binds himself to the Doom of\nMandos, ensuring his eventual downfall.\n\nTravelling to the mountains of Thangorodrim in disguise, Beren and\nLúthien succeed in making their way into Angband and to the very foot of\nMorgoth's throne. There Lúthien reveals herself, but her beauty and\ncharm enable her to briefly overcome the evil lord and she casts a spell\nthat puts Morgoth and his minions to sleep. Beren then cuts one of the\nSilmarils from Morgoth's iron crown, but when he attempts to take a\nsecond Silmaril his knife snaps and a shard flies off; it cuts Morgoth's\nface, and he begins to stir.\n\nAs they leave, Morgoth and his creatures reawaken and Beren and Lúthien\nare confronted by Carcharoth, the giant Wolf that guards the gate of\nAngband. Beren attempts to hold off the terrible creature with the power\nof the Silmaril, but Carcharoth bites off his hand and swallows the holy\njewel. Driven mad by the pain it inflicts, the creature goes on a\nrampage through Doriath until it is eventually killed by the mighty\nElf-hound Huan. In this final battle Beren is fatally wounded by\nCarcharoth, so Lúthien travels in spirit to the Houses of the Dead, to\nplead with Mandos for Beren's release. She and Beren are sent back to\nMiddle-earth alive, but Lúthien becomes a mortal woman, so that in time\nthey will both die and leave the Universe together. As immortals whose\nsouls are bound to Arda for as long as it lasts, Thingol and Melian\nsuffer the grief of being deprived of their daughter for all time.\n\nTúrin Turambar\n\n_Main article: Túrin Turambar_\n\n_See also: The Children of Húrin_\n\nAlso included is the story of Túrin Turambar. His father Húrin is\ncaptured at the end of the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, and for his\ndefiance, Morgoth places a curse on his family. Túrin becomes a great\nhero, but due partly to his hot temper and partly to a string of bad\nluck (in fact, the working of Morgoth's demonic will), whatever he turns\nhis hand to seems to go wrong, and death and grief haunt those around\nhim. Making matters worse, both Túrin and his sister Niënor are\nenchanted by the mighty dragon Glaurung — who has sacked the great\nElf-city of Nargothrond and taken up residence there — and they fall in\nlove and live for time as man and wife. Eventually Túrin kills Glaurung,\nbut with his death the spell is lifted. Driven mad by the realisation of\ntheir sins, Túrin and Nienor both commit suicide.\n\nGondolin\n\nThe last Elf-Kingdom to fall was the hidden city of Gondolin. Tuor, a\nmortal man, was sent by Ulmo as a messenger to Gondolin, to warn King\nTurgon of the city's impending destruction. Remaining in Gondolin, Tuor\nmarried Turgon's daughter, Idril, and they had a son Eärendil. Gondolin\nwas eventually betrayed to Morgoth by Maeglin, and destroyed. Turgon\nfell during the battle and the High Kingship passed to Gil-galad, who\ndwelt at the Mouth of Sirion. Tuor, Idril and Eärendil escaped, together\nwith a number of refugees.\n\nGrowing up, Eärendil married Elwing, granddaughter of Beren and Lúthien\nand current keeper of the Silmaril they took from Morgoth. With the help\nof the Silmaril, Eärendil and Elwing sailed to Valinor to plead with the\nValar, asking them to pardon the Noldor and assist Elves and Men in\ntheir need. The Valar agreed to this request, and set Eärendil, with the\nSilmaril, to sail the skies as a star until the ending of the world.\n\nBattle between Morgoth and the Host of the Valar\n\nThe Host of the Valar, led by Eönwë, finally attacked Morgoth in\nAngband. In this battle, the Great Battle (also known as the War of\nWrath), Morgoth was utterly defeated; his armies were destroyed, with\nonly a few remnants scattered across the Earth. He was taken prisoner\nand his two remaining Silmarils were confiscated. Maedhros and Maglor,\nFëanor's two surviving sons, stole the Silmarils from Eönwë, but they\nfound the Silmarils would not tolerate their touch, instead tormenting\nthem with burning pain. Maedhros committed suicide by jumping with the\nSilmaril into a chasm in the earth, and Maglor threw his Silmaril away\ninto the sea.\n\nThe Valar pardoned the Ñoldor for their rebellion, and the Teleri\noffered forgiveness for the Kinslaying. Many of the Ñoldor and the\nSindar left Middle-earth and traveled into the West, to live in Valinor.\nMany more followed Gil-galad and stayed in Middle-earth. Morgoth was\ncast out of the World, imprisoned in the Void that lies behind the Walls\nof Night. The Silmarils were lost “unless the World be broken and\nre-made”, but each one found its home in one of the elements: sky,\nwater, and earth."

    "text": "OSSIRIAND (Sindarin IPA: ) was a region of the eastern Beleriand. It was\nalso known as the LAND OF SEVEN RIVERS.\n\n\nDescription\n\nOssiriand was the most eastern region of Beleriand during the First Age,\nlying between the Blue Mountains and the river Gelion. Along the\nnorthern shore of the Ascar ran the Dwarf-Road to Nogrod. The region was\nwarm and gentle, with coniferous woodlands.\n\nSeven rivers lay in the region of Ossiriand, and these are (from north\nto south):\n\n1.  River _Gelion_\n2.  River _Ascar_ or _Rathlóriel_\n3.  River _Thalos_\n4.  River _Legolin_\n5.  River _Brilthor_\n6.  River _Duilwen_\n7.  River _Adurant_\n\n\nHistory\n\nOssiriand was a green and forested land, and it was not populated by the\nSindar. In the early First Age before the rise of the Moon, a part of\nthe Telerin elven people called Nandor entered Ossiriand under their\nleader King Denethor, and were given permission by Thingol to settle the\nlands.\n\nAfter them the land was often renamed Lindon, for _The Singers_, after\nthe old clan-name of the Telerin which the Nandor still used in their\ntongue. They became known as the Laiquendi, or Green-Elves.\n\nThe Elves of Ossiriand participated in the first battle of the Wars of\nBeleriand. After their leader Denethor was killed in an orc-raid they\nchose no more leaders, and many of them moved to Doriath.\n\nAfter the Quest for the Silmaril, Beren and Lúthien lived their second\nlives in Dor Firn-i-Guinar on Tol Galen. In FA 470, their son Dior was\nborn here. After the death of Thingol, Beren laid an attack against\nthe Dwarves of Nogrod, leading an army of Nandorin Elves and Ents.\n\nOssiriand was the only part of Beleriand that survived the War of Wrath,\nbut Belegaer the Great Sea broke through the mountain chain at the\nformer riverbed of Ascar, creating the Gulf of Lhûn. In the Second\nAge and Third Age, the former lands of Ossiriand and Thargelion were\nknown as LINDON, where Gil-galad the High King ruled.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name OSSIRIAND means “Land of the Seven Rivers”, from the Quenya\n_otso_ (“seven”), Sindarin _sîr_ (“river”), and '' -ian(d)'',\nwhich is commonly used in the names of regions or countries.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nWhile conceiving a name, J.R.R. Tolkien had numerous choices for this\nland. He originally wrote Broseliand (which eventually led to\nBeleriand). The other names were Colodhinand, Ñoldorinan, Geleriand,\nBladorinand, Belaurien, Arsiriand, Lassiriand, Ossiriand.",

    "text": "THANGORODRIM was a group of three gigantic active volcanoes within the\nIron Mountains in the north of Middle-earth during the First Age. They\nwere raised by Morgoth, who delved his fortress of Angband beneath them\nand far back into the Iron Mountains. They were the highest peaks in all\nof Middle Earth.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThangorodrim was made up of three volcanoes of which were said to have\nbeen crafted by Morgoth from the slag and debris of the re-delving of\nAngband during the First Age. The mountains themselves were of little\nconsequence during Morgoth's rule of Angband, save to occasionally spew\nforth fire and magma when Morgoth was either exceptionally wrathful or\non the warpath.\n\nAfter the death of his father, Maedhros was taken prisoner and nailed to\na cliff of Thangorodrim as a method of torture. He was rescued by his\ncousin Fingon with the help of Thorondor, King of the Eagles. After\nhis family was cursed by Morgoth, Húrin was imprisoned in a chair on a\nhigh terrace to watch the curse unfold.\n\nFor a time immediately after the creation of Thangorodrim, the Great\nEagles made their eyries on the three mountains at the command of\nManwë in order to bring him news of Morgoth's doings. However, at some\ntime during the First Age the Eagles moved to the Crissaegrim near\nGondolin.\n\nAt the base of the south face of the middle peak was the Great Gate of\nAngband, a deep canyon leading into the mountain, lined with towers and\nforts. There were also a number of secret gates scattered around the\nsides of the mountain group, from which Morgoth's hosts could issue\nforth and surprise their foes.\n\nThangorodrim was destroyed during the War of Wrath at the end of the\nFirst Age when Ancalagon, freshly slain by Eärendil fell dead on the\npeaks and crushed them to rubble.\n\n\nSize and Height\n\nThe exact size and height of Thangorodrim are unclear, though they were\nsaid to have been the tallest mountains in Middle-earth. One drawing by\nTolkien illustrated in Karen Wynn Fonstad's _The Atlas of Middle-earth_,\nif drawn to scale, would have made each mountain 35,000 ft high and five\nmiles across, and the statement that it lay 150 leagues (450 Númenórean\nmiles) north of Menegroth puts it too far away for some of the action in\n_The Silmarillion_ to make sense; a distance of 150-200 miles would have\nbeen more consistent. It is possible that with the higher figure Tolkien\nwas not referring to 'as the eagle flies', but rather 'as the wolf\nruns': the plateau of Dorthonion forced a long detour, which added the\nextra 200, 250 miles to the distance.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_THANGORODRIM_ was a Sindarin word that tied together the roots\n'oppression', 'mountain', and 'group'; together meaning roughly\n'Oppressive peaks'."

In the middle of Arda, where the light of the lamps\nmingled, amid the Great Lake lay the Isle of Almaren, where the Valar\ndwelt.\n\nDestruction\n\nThe pillars were cast down and their lamps broken by Melkor. Lands were\nbroken, seas arose in tumult, and destroying flame from the broken lamps\npoured out over the Earth, marring it, causing the Valar to flee\nMiddle-earth for the Land of Aman, where they established the domain of\nValinor. Where Illuin fell, the Sea of Helcar was formed, of which\nCuiviénen was a bay.\n\n\nOther Versions of the Legendarium\n\nIn Tolkien's older writings (not used in the published version of _The\nSilmarillion_), the Valar sought peace with Melkor, asking his\nassistance with fixing the lamps upon Arda. Melkor, still envious and\nhateful of the rest of the Valar, agreed to give them a strong, sturdy\nsubstance. He gave Aulë ice. Melkor permitted the Valar to do as they\nwished until the fateful day when the Lamps' light and heat finally\nmelted the ice. The pillars crashed upon Arda, flooding it with water\nand darkness."

Amlaith, the\ntrue heir to the throne of Arnor, was opposed by his two brothers.\nUnable to resolve the situation, he was reduced to ruling the region of\nArthedain, which consisted approximately of the lands west of the\nBrandywine River and north of the Great East Road. (His brothers created\nthe kingdoms of Cardolan and Rhudaur to the south.)\n\nThe kingdom's capital was at Fornost, and Bree was one of its most\nimportant towns. Annúminas was in the territory of Arthedain, but mostly\nabandoned and falling into ruin.\n\nIn TA 1300 the kingdom of Angmar appeared at Arthedain's north-eastern\nborder. Its King was the chief of the Ringwraiths, although this was not\nknown to the Dúnedain. When this new threat came Cardolan placed itself\nunder the suzerainty of Arthedain, which then began to call itself ARNOR\nagain. Cardolan repeatedly sent aid to Arthedain when needed but by TA\n1409 Cardolan and Rhudaur were conquered by Angmar.\n\nArthedain kept up the resistance against Angmar for over 500 years but\nin TA 1974 Arthedain was overrun and Fornost fell into the hands of\nAngmar. It fell just one year too soon for help was underway from Gondor\nunder the lead of Eärnur. This army reached Arthedain in TA 1975 and\ndestroyed Angmar at the Battle of Fornost.\n\nIts last King, Arvedui, drowned just before the battle was fought. The\nkings of Arthedain were also the lords of The Shire and the Shire chose\nthe Thain to replace the kings.\n\nThe son of Arvedui, Aranarth decided not to rebuild the kingdom and so\nbecame the first Chieftain of the Dúnedain. From him Aragorn is\ndescended.\n\n\nArthedain (people)\n\nThe ARTHEDAIN (Sindarin for _Edain of the Realm_) were the Dúnedain of\nthe old Kingdom of Arthedain.They were the purest-blooded descendants of\nthe Númenóreans among the Dúnedain of Arnor.

In spring it bore\nnumerous white flowers, but few of these ever fructified; what shape the\nfruit was is never described, nor is it considered to be edible. The\nleaves were laurel-like, dark green above and bright silver beneath. The\nwood when burned gives off a dense, choking, volumnious smoke that forms\na fog capable of burying an entire country in darkness for several days.\n\nIt was fashioned in the image of Telperion, elder of the Two Trees of\nValinor, originally. This image was given to the Elves of Kortirion in\nValinor and named Galathilion. From it a sapling was taken to Tol\nEressëa, named Celeborn. This in turn sired the tree Nimloth of Númenor,\nfelled by Sauron and burned on the altars.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFirst White Tree\n\nThe first White Tree of Gondor came from a fruit that Isildur, at great\npersonal risk, managed to steal from Nimloth the Fair, the White Tree of\nNúmenor, before that one was destroyed at Sauron's insistence. He\nsuffered many wounds at this mission, and he came near death, but when\nthe first leaf opened in the spring, Isildur was healed of his wounds.\n\nThis sapling was brought to Middle-earth on Isildur's ship, and it was\neventually planted in Minas Ithil before the house of Isildur. But when\nSauron returned to Middle-earth, he launched a sudden attack that\ncaptured Minas Ithil, and he destroyed the White Tree. Isildur escaped\ntaking with him again a sapling.\n\nSecond White Tree\n\nIn the Year 2 of the Third Age, Isildur plants the seedling of the White\nTree in Minas Anor.\n\nThis White Tree lasts until TA 1636, when the Great Plague hits Gondor,\nkilling among many others King Telemnar and his children.\n\nThird White Tree\n\nA third sapling is planted in TA 1640 by King Tarondor. This one lasts\nuntil the year 2852 and the death of the Ruling Steward Belecthor II.\n\nAt this time no seedling of the tree could be found. As a result it was\nleft standing after its death.\n\nFourth White Tree\n\nWhen Aragorn becomes king he discovers (with Gandalf's help) a sapling\nof the White Tree upon the slopes of Mindolluin, high above the city,\nwhich he reverently plants in its place. The dead tree is removed from\nthe court but is placed in the Tombs of the Kings with all the honour\nthat would normally be accorded a fallen monarch. In June of TA 3019 the\nsapling blooms.\n"

    "text": "RHUDAUR was the smallest of the kingdoms that originated from the\nbreak-up of Arnor in TA 861. The other kingdoms were Arthedain and\nCardolan.\n\n\nHistory\n\nRhudaur formed the eastern part of Arnor, and stretched from the Weather\nHills with Weathertop to the river Loudwater. It shared a long border\nwith Cardolan along the Great East Road, and with Arthedain along the\nline of the Weather Hills.\n\nThe land between the rivers Hoarwell and Loudwater was also considered\npart of Rhudaur. It was called _the Angle_, and it is here that the\nfirst Stoor Hobbits came into Eriador around TA 1150. However, due to\nthe increasing hostility of Angmar these Stoors fled the region around\nTA 1356, with some of them moving west to the Shire, and others moving\nback to Wilderland.\n\n\n\nFrom the start of its existence, Rhudaur was unfriendly towards the two\nother successor states, and took part in a bitter conflict with\nArthedain over the Tower of Amon Sûl and the Palantír associated with\nthe tower.\n\n\n\nThe last Kings of Rhudaur were not of Númenórean blood, but were\ndescended of Men in service of Angmar. Under their rule the land became\na vassal of Angmar, and thus enemies of Cardolan and Arthedain.\n\nAngmar annexed and terminated the kingdom in TA 1409. By this time, the\nDúnedain were gone from the region, as well as most of the other\ninhabitants.\n\nThere is evidence that after the fall of Angmar at the Battle of Fornost\nthe Angle became home to the remainder of the Dúnedain, and the Rangers\nof the North established several villages there, where their people\nlived until the resurrection of the northern Kingdom under King Aragorn\nII Elessar at the end of the Third Age.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe _Haeranedain_ (S.“Far Wandering Edain”) were Rhudaurians of\nNúmenorean descent, most were actually mix-blooded Tergil. Most\nRhudaurian Dúnedain belonged to one of seven greater Noble Houses of\nHiri, House Amrothar, House Eldanar, House Enedil, House Melosse, House\nMithlad, House Rhudainor and House Rómentir.\n\nThe name Rhudaur appears to be dialect Sindarin for 'East Forests',\n\nThe _Rhudaurians_ (S.“Rhudaurim”) were the inhabitants of the fallen\nkingdom of Rhudaur, in the closer sense those of númenorean blood, the\nHaeranedain, in a wider sense all those eriadorian tribes living inside\nthe borders of Rhudaur including:\n\n-   the Hillmen of the Trollshaws and Coldfells\n-   the Vulseggi or northrons of the Egladil\n-   the Dunmen of the southern borderlands to Eregion and Cardolan\n-   the Forodrim of the Northern marches\n\n\nAppearance\n\nThe Haeranedain were a bit smaller and darker than the high Dúnedain,\nalthough 6 ft for men was not uncommon.\n\nIn daily life most had adapted clothes much similar to those of the\nindigenous Hillmen, the _Kailth_, a skirt or kilt, and the _Kullodoo_.",

    "text": "SIRION was a river in Middle-earth during the First Age, the principal\nriver of Beleriand. During most of its course, it was the border between\nEast and West Beleriand.\n\n\nSource\n\nThe Sirion's source was at Eithel Sirion on the eastern side of the Ered\nWethrin, which lay in between Ard-galen (later Anfauglith) and Mithrim\nand Hithlum. It was guarded by the tower of Barad Eithel.\n\nSirion flowed southwards along the border of the Ered Wethrin, passing\nthrough the Fen of Serech before entering the narrow steep-sided valley\nbetween the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath named the PASS OF SIRION.\nSirion then continued south into Beleriand, with the Forest of Brethil\nto the west, and Dimbar and then Doriath to the east. After leaving\nDoriath at Aelin-uial (the Fens of Sirion), it plunged below ground in\nthe Falls of Sirion at Andram, where the ground fell steeply. Three\nleagues southwards, the Sirion exited the underground caves at the Gates\nof Sirion. It then flowed further south through NAN-TATHREN until it\nreached the Bay of Balar, part of Belegaer, at the Mouths of Sirion. It\ntotal length was about three hundred and ninety miles.\n\nIn order from north to south, the principal tributaries of the Sirion\nwere the Rivil, flowing from Dorthonion until it met Sirion in the Fen\nof Serech; the Mindeb, which had its source in Nan Dungortheb and the\nEred Gorgoroth, the Teiglin, the Esgalduin of Doriath; the Aros flowing\nsouth from Dorthonion (and also containing the waters of the Celon from\nHimring and Himlad) which met at Aelin-uial, and the Narog, which joined\nSirion in Nan-Tathren.\n\nThe main crossing points mentioned in the Silmarillion were Brithiach\nwhere the road from Himlad, which crossed the Esgalduin at Iant Iaur,\ncrossed Sirion, and the Ferries of Doriath. The most important island in\nSirion was Tol Sirion. The original Minas Tirith was built here by\nFinrod Felagund in the strategic location controlling the Pass of Sirion\nwhere it entered Beleriand between the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath.\nShortly after Dagor Bragollach, Sauron captured it and the island became\nknown as Tol-in-Gaurhoth.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBarad Eithel, at the source of the Sirion in the Ered Wethrin, was a\nchief fortress of Fingolfin and his son Fingon, probably guarding a pass\ninto their realm of Mithrim. Further south, in the Pass of Sirion, lay\nTol Sirion. After the Coming of Men, the Edain of the House of Haleth\nmade their home in the Forest of Brethil, and the Sindar ruled by\nThingol lay secure within the Girdle of Melian in their realm of\nDoriath. At the outflow of Sirion into Belegaer, after the destruction\nof Eglarest and Brithombar, the Havens of Sirion were built by Círdan\nand his people."

    "text": "NARGOTHROND (Sindarin IPA: ) was the Elven stronghold built by Finrod\nFelagund, delved into the banks of the river Narog in Beleriand during\nthe First Age.\n\n\nDescription\n\nSimilar to the structures of many underground Dwarven cities,\nNargothrond consisted of many miles of caves and tunnels of various\nshapes and sizes carved through the rock, which was possibly limestone.\nThere were three Great Halls centered around the other tunnels and\ncaves, where the Lord of the city no doubt sat. The deepest of the caves\nwas the Innermost Chamber where Glaurung later hoarded up the remaining\ntreasures of Nargothrond and sat upon them until he left. Lúthien lived\nin a southwestern cave chamber during her stay there. The realms\narmouries were in several chambers south of the Great Halls. The main\nentrance through the Doors of Felagund to Nargothrond facing river Narog\none came into a large chamber, which was about five-hundred feet from\nthe Great Halls of Felagund.\n\n\nHistory\n\nYears of Peace\n\nInspired by Menegroth in Doriath, and seeking a hidden place from which\nto be safe from the forces of Morgoth, Finrod established it in the\nearly years following the return of the Ñoldor to Middle-earth, in the\nCaverns of Narog beneath the forested hills of TAUR-EN-FAROTH on the\nwestern bank of Narog. He was aided by the Dwarves of Nogrod who also\nmade for him the Nauglamír, the Necklace of the Dwarves.\n\nHowever, Finrod was not the first to delve in those caves: it had first\nbeen inhabited by the Petty-dwarves, who called it NULUKKIZDÎN (Khuzdul\nIPA: ) before they were driven out. Originally, a narrow path along the\nbanks of the river could only reach it, but later a bridge was built\nacross the Narog.\n\nFinrod ruled Nargothrond until he joined Beren in his Quest for the\nSilmaril, being succeeded by his nephew Orodreth. However, the Sons of\nFëanor, Celegorm and Curufin lived in Nargothrond at this time and\ncarried a great influence with its people, sowing fear and distrust of\noutsiders. After Finrod's death was reported they were exiled in\ndisgrace.\n\nFall of Nargothrond\n\n[Túrin and Glaurung, by woutart \n\nSince its foundation by Finrod, the Elves of Nargothrond had pursued a\nsecretive war against Morgoth, hunting his forces by stealth and ambush\nrather than going to open war. When Túrin was led there by Gwindor,\nhowever, he grew high in the esteem of Orodreth, Lord of Nargothrond,\nand counseled a different strategy.\n\nTúrin Turambar became one of the chief captains, persuading the people\nto abandon their long standing policy and instead fight openly against\nMorgoth.\n\nTúrin persuaded Orodreth to build the Bridge of Nargothrond to allow\nspeedy passage of forces into the field. Orodreth built the bridge from\nhis doors across the Narog, and went to open war with Morgoth. In\ncenturies of searching, Morgoth had been unable to find the fortress of\nNargothrond, but now not only was its location revealed, but the new\nbridge removed the defence of the River Narog. Glaurung the dragon was\nsent out from Angband with an army of Orcs to capture the city. After\nthe defeat of the army of Nargothrond at the field of Tumhalad in FA\n495, Glaurung and his army of Orcs came south, crossed the bridge, and\nsacked the city, killing or selling some of the inhabitants into\nslavery. The survivors, then went to seek refuge in Doriath, and that's\nhow Thingol knew of the fall of Nargothrond.\n\nGlaurung remained there until FA 499 when he went northeast to Brethil,\nto confront Túrin Turambar who eventually slew him. Though the realm was\nno more, Mîm the Petty-dwarf took up residence in caves claiming it and\nits treasures as his own in payment for the sufferings of his people,\nuntil Húrin came and slew him for his betrayal of his son. The treasure,\nincluding the Nauglamír, was then brought to the Elven Kingdom of\nDoriath and given to King Thingol. Afterwards, the caves were\ndestroyed during the War of Wrath, along with all of Beleriand.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_NARGOTHROND_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Narog-fortress-vaulted\nhall'.",

The Ñoldor, led by Fëanor and his sons, tried to persuade\ntheir friends, the Teleri of Alqualondë, to give him their ships.\nHowever, the Teleri would not help in any way against the will of the\nValar, and in fact attempted to persuade their friends to reconsider and\nstay in Aman. Unwilling to take “no” for an answer, the Ñoldor started\ntaking the ships and sailing them away. This angered the Teleri, and\nthey threatened the Ñoldor with rocks and arrows, and they threw many of\nFëanor's followers out of the ships and into the harbor. They also began\nto attempt to block the harbour; however, it is only slightly possible\nthat the Teleri drew first blood.\n\n\nThe Battle\n\nThen the Ñoldor drew swords, and the Teleri their bows, and there was a\nbitter fight that seemed evenly matched, if not even in favor of the\nTeleri, until the second Host of the Ñoldor, led by Fingon, arrived\ntogether with some of Fingolfin's people. Misunderstanding the\nsituation, they assumed the Teleri had attacked the Ñoldor under orders\nof the Valar, and they joined the fight.\n\nConsequences\n\nIn the end many Teleri were slain and the ships taken and many of the\nstolen ships were wrecked in the waves. All that continued towards\nMiddle-earth were therefore cursed by Mandos. The act also had\nrepercussions in Middle-earth, when the Sindar, especially those of\nDoriath, found out about it, costing the Ñoldor the support of the\nSindar in their war against Morgoth; the Sindar King Thingol barred\nthose of the House of Fëanor, or any others that took place in the\nKinslaying, from entering his kingdom.

Translated into English, it reads, “_Sting_ is my name; I am the\nspider's bane.” The Appendix of ''The Silmarillion _defines_ _the\nelement _maeg'' in Sindarin as meaning “sharp” or “piercing”. During the\nThird Age, it was wielded by Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins, and Samwise\nGamgee.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nSting was an ancient Elvish blade made by weapon-smiths in Gondolin.\nWhen Orcs or goblins were within an undetermined radius of it, the blade\nglowed blue, alerting the wielder and others who could see it to their\npresence. It had been lost during the Fall of Gondolin, the same battle\nin which Turgon fell and Glamdring was taken. It appeared as a curved\nblade with a silver loop or spiral design on it, later runes were added\nto it by Bilbo after his adventures. These runes seem to have been made\nby the Elves as they are in Sindarin.\n\nIn _The Hobbit_, Bilbo and his dwarven companions found Sting in a\nTroll-hoard alongside two other elven blades: Glamdring and Orcrist.\nThough just a dagger by the standard of elves, Sting made a perfect\nshort sword for a Hobbit, although it was still rather small, as Bilbo\ninitially chose to wear it “inside his breeches” and was still able\nto travel and even run without any apparent inconvenience.\n\nJust before his nephew embarked on his quest to Mordor from Rivendell,\nBilbo gave Sting to Frodo. Sam then took the weapon from his (seemingly\ndead) master and used it to good effect against Shelob on the borders of\nMordor. After the defeat of Sauron at the end of the Third Age, Frodo\nentrusted Sting to Sam and it became an heirloom of the Gamgee family.\n\nGollum, who disliked anything made by the Elves, was afraid of Sting.\nThis fear aided Bilbo when he confronted Gollum in the Cave at the base\nof the Misty Mountains in _The Hobbit_. It also helped Frodo and Sam\nsubdue Gollum in _The Lord of the Rings_. Orcs also had an instinctive\nfear of these weapons and hated any who carried them.\n\nAs is fitting for a blade of Gondolin, Sting could easily cut through\nthe webs of the offspring of Ungoliant, including the evil Shelob and\nthe spiders of Mirkwood. Bilbo had named the weapon _Sting_ after he had\n“stung” one of them with it. In The Hobbit when Bilbo wears the One\nRing, and defends himself against a spider, he names the blade “Sting”.\nThe narrator describes the spider's lack of acquaintance with creatures\nwith such stings, and evidently this was also Bilbo's presumption in\nnaming it as such. Sting was like Glamdring and Orcrist in that “being\nthe work of Elvish smiths in the Elder Days these swords shone with a\ncold light, if any Orcs were near at hand.” But only Sting was\ndefinitively described as glowing blue, or glittering with blue flame at\nits edges.\n",

    "text": "CUIVIÉNEN (Quenya IPA: ) was the location where the Quendi or the Elves\nawoke.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nCuiviénen was said to have been on the shore of a large gulf in the\ninland Sea of Helcar in the far east of Middle-earth. It was an\neastern bay of the Inland Sea of Helcar, formed by the meltwaters of the\npillar of Illuin.\n\nAfter the First Age and the War of Wrath, the Sea of Helcar (and\nCuiviénen with it) was drained, leaving behind only the Sea of Núrnen\nand the Sea of Rhûn, prompting the Elvish adage “and to Cuiviénen there\nis no returning”; both a reference to physical geography and a metaphor\nfor the Sundering. While never confirmed, there is a small chance that\nit survives in a much truncated form.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn YT 1050, the Awakening of the Elves took place. The Elves dwelt\nhere for a long time in bliss under the starlight and were content.\nHere the elves were divided into their three basic groups: the Minyar\n(Vanyar), Tatyar (Ñoldor), and Nelyar (Teleri), here they learned and\ndeveloped the basic skills of survival, culture, and language.\n\nUnfortunately, Melkor discovered this land first before the other Valar.\nMany elves feared him and they were forced to hide, and those\nunfortunate enough to be left behind or overwhelmed by fear and\nunhappiness were taken or slain. Then, years later, Oromë discovered\nCuiviénen on his travels throughout Middle-earth. Oromé reported his\ndiscovery back to the Valar in Valinor and after some debate they\ndecided that the Elves would be safer living in The Undying Lands, in\nthe peace and protection of the Valar. Oromé returned to Cuiviénen and\nthere spoke with the Elves regarding their removal to Valinor. The first\nSundering of the Elves then took place when the Eldar, name that was\ngiven by Oromé to the Elves using their own tongue, departed from\nCuiviénen to Valinor. Some of these Elves refused to leave through fear\nof the unknown, turned back after reaching the huge range of The Misty\nMountains, or simply decided to stay in Arda through choice.\n\nIt is unknown how long the remaining Avari remained at Cuiviénen during\nthe First Age, but they were there when Men awoke at the first rising of\nthe Sun in the nearby land of Hildórien, and its elven residents\nbefriended early Men and apparently taught them the basic skills of\nsurvival.\n\nOther mentions\n\nIn his attempt to sway the Ñoldor to join him in pursuit of Melkor to\nMiddle-earth, Fëanor spoke of the “sweet waters” of Cuiviénen that they\nhad left in vain to travel to Aman.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nCUIVIÉNEN is a Quenya word that means “Water of Awakening” from\n_cuivié_ (“awakening”) and _nen_ (“water”).",

However, the battle claimed the lives\nof many, including Frerin, the second son of Thráin II, and the younger\nbrother of Thorin Oakenshield. Fundin, father of Balin and Dwalin, also\nfell.

However, the Dwarves of Durin's folk\nwere too few, and the Dwarves of the other six houses believed that they\ndid not have the strength to confront Durin's Bane, though none knew\nwhat it was.\n\nThe aftermath of the battle and the overall war resulted in devastating\nlosses for all the dwarves involved, but virtually all of the Orcs\ninfesting the Misty Mountains were destroyed, leaving only a handful\nleft. This resulted in the Misty Mountains being relatively safer for\nthe next two centuries. The Battle of Azanulbizar was also where Thorin\nearned the name “Oakenshield”; after his shield was broken during the\nbattle, he cleaved a great branch from a nearby oak tree to use as both\na shield and a bludgeon.\n\nThe Dwarves' losses were so great that it was impossible to bury all\ntheir dead, and instead the corpses were burned on funeral pyres. In\nlater years, the relatives and descendants of these casualties would\ncommonly say of their ancestor, _“He was a burned Dwarf”_, a remark\ninstantly understandable as a reference to Azanulbizar and the Dwarves\nwho died there.\n",

One Éored was one\nhundredth of the Éoherë - the full muster of Rohan. The Riders of an\nÉored could serve for a term or on a permanent basis. Each Éored was led\nby a captain.

Under King\nFolcwine, the military of Rohan was reordered. Under Folcwine, one Éored\nwas made up of 120 riders including their captain. Each Éored was also\nsupposed to comprise one-hundredth of the whole Muster of Rohan, not\nincluding the household of the King.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nThe changes made by Folcwine continued through the time of the War of\nthe Ring. While the force commanded by Théoden King son of Thengel at\nthe Battle of the Pelennor Fields did not number much more than half of\n12,000 riders, it was possibly the largest riding of the Rohirrim in\nhistory.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Éomer, the Third Marshal of the Mark, defied\norders and led his Éored in pursuit of a band of orcs who had entered\nRohan from the Emyn Muil. In the battle between Éomer's men and the\norcs, fifteen Riders were killed. Éomer's Éored thus numbered only 105\nwhen they encountered Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli on February 30,\n3019.\n\nMerry Brandybuck and Éowyn, disguised as a Rider named Dernhelm, rode\nwith the Éored commanded by Elfhelm to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields\non March 15.

As such, there were usually three Marshals.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe first Marshal's charge was the King's lands. These included Folde\nand Harrowdale, and the muster also of Edoras, the capital. The second\nMarshal was usually charged with the West-Mark, including the Fords of\nIsen, a pivotal location in Rohan's defense during the War of the Ring.\nThe Hornburg (Helm's Deep) was the base of the West-Mark's Marshal. The\nEast-Mark often went to the third Marshal. His headquarters were at\nAldburg, once the home of Eorl the Young, first King of the Mark. The\nsecond and third Marshals, however, were interchangeable, and were\nassigned based on need by the King.\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring, Théoden King son of Thengel still\nheld loosely the title of first Marshal. During his youth, he had\nenjoyed leading the Muster of Edoras, but as he fell under the\ngrowing shadow of Saruman, and his servant Wormtongue, Théoden began to\nneglect his charges and duties as a Marshal. The second Marshal and\ncommander of the Westfold was Théodred, son and heir of Théoden. Éomer\nson of Éomund, nephew of the King, was the third Marshal, and filled his\nfather's post as commander of the East-Mark. Due to Théoden's condition,\nthe de facto commander at Edoras was Elfhelm, who acted as a Marshal of\nthe Mark. Háma, the loyal captain of the King's guard, was also at the\ncapital.\n\nWhen war with Saruman began, Théodred assumed command of Rohan's army,\ndespite the orders of his father speaking through his wicked counsellor\nGríma. Théodred ordered a muster to Edoras and soon led a good portion\nof the King's riders west to strengthen the Fords of Isen against\ninvasion. Later, Éomer defied the King and led his Éored (riders of his\nown household, his personal guard) to remove the herdfolk of the\nEast-Mark behind the fens of Entwash. There he encountered the Orcs\nreturning to Isengard from the Falls of Rauros, and later Aragorn,\nLegolas and Gimli.\n\nDuring the battles of the Lord of the Rings, the renewed Théoden assumed\ncommand of the army. With Théodred slain, Éomer acted as first Marshal.\nElfhelm led the muster of Eastfold, while Grimbold, previously a captain\nand hero of the battles at the Fords of Isen, commanded the riders of\nWestfold. After the War of the Ring was ended, Éomer King reordered the\npositions of the Marshals. He himself commanded the Muster of Rohan, and\ncaused the position of first Marshal to be held ever by the King or, in\nthe case of age or sickness, the King's heir (assuming the King had at\nleast another clear claimant to the throne). The positions of second and\nthird Marshal were largely dissolved, replaced by the titles Marshal of\nthe East-Mark and of the West-Mark.\n\nde:Marschall der Riddermark ru:Маршал Рохана"

It explained why\nThorin and Gandalf have to retake the Lonely Mountain, and it is an\nadventure recounted from the perspective of Bilbo Baggins.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nGandalf knew that Smaug could pose a serious threat if used by Sauron in\nwar, then dwelling in Dol Guldur in Mirkwood. He was thinking about the\nmatter when he met Thorin Oakenshield at Bree. Thorin also was concerned\nabout Smaug, but had the different motive of revenge and the reclaiming\nof the Dwarves' treasure in the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf agreed to help\nThorin.\n\nGandalf thought Bilbo, an unlikely choice, to be a suitable companion of\nThorin and his Dwarves for a number of reasons. First, he had observed\nthat Bilbo took an interest in the world at large, and was thus\nadventurous. Another reason is that Smaug would not recognize the scent\nof a Hobbit, advantageous to a stealthy operation. Thorin also did not\nthink highly of Hobbits, and putting Bilbo in the expedition might\nprevent the proud Thorin from rash actions — such as openly challenging\nSmaug.\n\nIt was Thorin's objections to Bilbo that Gandalf found most difficult to\novercome. Thorin believed that Bilbo was incapable of helping their\nadventure and that Gandalf might be simply meddling in his affairs for\nhis own reasons. After much debate, Gandalf convinced Thorin that Bilbo\nwould be a worthy member. It could be thought that Gandalf arranged this\nas he has foreseen the later event and wanted to create another front to\nfight Sauron.\n\nThe Quest\n\nThe Company started from the Shire to the Trollshaws. Three\nStone-trolls, Tom, William and Bert caught them. Luckily, they were\nsaved by Gandalf, by slamming the ground that hid the Troll cave from\nthe sunlight, thus turning them to stone. Then they passed the Hidden\nValley and arrived in Rivendell. They left Gandalf behind with the White\nCouncil and went to High Pass. After being saved by Gandalf again in\nGoblin-town, they were hunted by Bolg's wargs. They were saved by\nGwaihir and the other Great Eagles. After having a night in Beorn's\nhouse, they went to Mirkwood. Thranduil caught them and locked them in\nthe cells. While, Bilbo, who was wearing the Ring, he saved the Company\nby Barrels. And they found Bard who brought them to Lake-town. They\ntempted the Master of Laketown and they successfully reached the Lonely\nMountain.\n\n\nThe Quest in The Lord of the Rings\n\n“The Quest of Erebor” was originally written in the 1950s to be a part\nof _The Lord of the Rings_ but Tolkien decided not to include it, and\nonly a very abridged version of the tale occurred in the Appendices.\nThere are two manuscripts extant of the work. Both are written in the\nfirst person, from the perspective of Frodo Baggins. However, nearly all\nof the text consists of narration by Gandalf, who was telling the story\nat the request of Frodo in Minas Tirith after the coronation of King\nAragorn II Elessar in _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\n\nNotes\n\n-   The Quest caused Battle of Five Armies and indirectly caused the War\n    of the Ring.\n"

The Paths then continued past forgotten\ncities, emerging at the southern end of the White Mountains in Morthond\nvale, near the Stone of Erech.\n\nIn the Second Age, a people related to the Dunlendings had lived in the\nWhite Mountains, and they had for a time served the Dark Lord Sauron.\nThey later swore allegiance to Isildur of Gondor and Arnor, but betrayed\nhim during the Last Alliance of Elves and Men and refused to fight on\neither side. For this reason, Isildur cursed them, proclaiming that, if\nthe Alliance triumphed, they would linger in the mountains until one of\nhis heirs called them again to fight against Sauron.\n\nIsildur's curse succeeded: their people dwindled and eventually died\nout, until only their ghosts remained at the end of the Third Age. When\nAragorn and company took the Paths of the Dead and, deep within the\nmountains, summoned them to the Stone of Erech, their shades followed\nhim. At the Stone at midnight, Aragorn unfurled his banner, declared\nhimself the heir of Isildur, and commanded the dead to aid him; they\nobeyed, and defeated the armies of the Corsairs of Umbar who were\nattacking the landings in southern Gondor. (Supposedly, the only weapon\nthat they required was fear, driving their enemies to cast themselves\nmadly into the sea.) When those foes were defeated and Aragorn could\nclaim the black ships of the Corsairs for his own, he declared that the\ncurse was lifted, and the dead departed forever. When the dead had gone,\nthe men of southern Gondor joined Aragorn in the ships and sailed to the\naid of Minas Tirith.\n"

    "page_id": "2652",
    "text": "The HISTORY OF ARDA is divided into three time periods, known as the\nYears of the Lamps, Years of the Trees and Years of the Sun. A separate,\noverlapping chronology divides the history into 'Ages of the Children of\nIlúvatar'. The first such Age began with the Awakening of the Elves\nduring the Years of the Trees and continued for the first six centuries\nof the Years of the Sun. All the subsequent Ages took place during the\nYears of the Sun. Most Middle-earth stories take place in the first\nthree Ages of the Children of Ilúvatar.\n\n\nBasic history\n\nMusic of the Ainur\n\n_Main article: Ainulindalë_\n\nThe supreme deity is called Eru Ilúvatar. In the beginning, Ilúvatar\ncreated spirits named the Ainur. Ilúvatar made divine music with them.\nMelkor, Tolkien's equivalent of Satan, who was then one of the Ainur,\nbroke the harmony of the music, until Ilúvatar began a third theme which\nthe Ainur could not comprehend since they were not the source of it. The\nessence of their song symbolized the history of the whole universe and\nthe Children of Ilúvatar who were to dwell in it - the Men and the\nElves.\n\nThen Ilúvatar created Eä, the universe itself, and the Ainur formed\nwithin it Arda, the Earth, “globed within the void”: the world together\nwith the airs is set apart from _Kuma_, the “void” without. The first 15\nof the Ainur who descended to Arda, and the most powerful ones, were\ncalled Valar, and the Ainur of lesser might who followed were called\nMaiar.\n\nYears of the Lamps\n\n_Main article: Years of the Lamps_\n\nThe Years of the Lamps began shortly after the creation of Arda by the\nValar. After the Valar entered the world, there was a light veiling the\nground. The Valar took this light and concentrated it into two large\nlamps, Iluin and Ormal. The Vala Aulë forged great towers, one in the\nfurthest north, and another in the deepest south. The Valar lived in the\nmiddle, at the island of Almaren. The end of the Years of the Lamps was\nmarked by Melkor's destruction of the Two Lamps.\n\nYears of the Trees\n\n_Main article: Years of the Trees_\n\nShortly after the destruction of the Two Lamps, Yavanna made the Two\nTrees, named Telperion (the silver tree) and Laurelin (the gold tree) in\nthe land of Aman, where the Valar now lived. The Trees illuminated Aman,\nleaving Middle-earth in darkness, save the light of the stars.\n\nThe Elves awoke in Cuiviénen, and were soon approached by the Valar, but\nalso by Melkor. This event marked the beginning of the First Age. Many,\nthough not all, of the Elves were persuaded to go on the Great Journey\nwestwards towards Aman. Along the journey several groups of Elves\ntarried, notably the Nandor and the Sindar. The three clans who arrived\nat Aman were the Vanyar, Ñoldor, and the Teleri.\n\nThe Valar had captured Melkor and placed him in chains in Aman. After he\nappeared to repent and was released, Melkor sowed great discord among\nthe elves, and stirred up rivalry between the Ñoldorin King Finwë's two\nsons Fëanor and Fingolfin. Out of jealousy and hatred for the Silmarils\nthree gems crafted by Feänor that contained the light of the Two Trees\nMelkor stole them, killing Finwë, who was guarding the jewels. Then,\nwith the help of the creature Ungoliant, he destroyed the Two Trees and\nescaped to Middle-earth.\n\nBitter at the Valar's inactivity, Feänor and his house left to pursue\nMelkor, cursing him with the name 'Morgoth'. A larger host, commanded by\nFingolfin, followed him. They reached the Telerin port-city of\nAlqualondë, but their Lord forbade them to use the Telerin ships. Feänor\ndecided to take them by force and thus the first Kinslaying ensued and\nonly by the strength in numbers were the Teleri overcome and their fair\nships stolen.\n\nFeänor's host sailed on the vessels, and burned them when he arrived in\nMiddle-earth. Left behind, Fingolfin and his company crossed over to\nMiddle-earth through the Helcaraxë (also known as the Grinding Ice) in\nthe far north. Around the same time, but separately, Galadriel and\nCeleborn set sail for Middle-earth without the permission of the Valar.\n\nYears of the Sun\n\nThe Years of the Sun began when the Valar made the Sun and the Moon out\nof the final fruit of Laurelin and the final flower of Telperion and set\nthem in the heavens. Thereafter, years were reckoned in Middle-earth as\nthey are in our own real world. The First Age of the Children of\nIlúvatar continued into this new reckoning of time.\n\nAges of the Children of Ilúvatar\n\nFirst Age\n\n_Main article: First Age_\n\nFeänor was soon lost in an attack on Morgoth's Balrog s - but his sons\nsurvived, and founded realms the kingdoms of the House of Fingolfin.\n\nThe Long Peace lasted hundreds of years; during which time Men arrived\nover the Blue Mountains, but the peace was not to last; and one by one\nthe kingdoms even the hidden ones of Gondolin and Doriath eventually\nfell.\n\nAt the end of the age, all that remained of free Elves and Men in\nBeleriand was a settlement at the mouth of the River Sirion and another\nsettlement on the isle of Balar. Eärendil had possession of a Silmaril,\nwhich his wife Elwing's ancestors Beren and Lúthien had taken from\nMorgoth, but the Feänorians had a claim on the Silmaril still and so\nthere was another Kinslaying. Eärendil and Elwing took the Silmaril\nacross the Great Sea, to beg the Valar for aid.\n\nThey responded. Melkor was exiled into the Void; and most of his works\nwere destroyed. This came at a terrible cost, as Beleriand itself was\nsunk.\n\nSecond Age\n\n_Main article: Second Age_\n\nThe men who had remained faithful were given the island of Númenor, in\nthe middle of the Great Sea whilst the Elves were allowed to return\nhome.\n\nThe Númenóreans became great seafarers, but were jealous of the elves\nfor their immortality. Meanwhile, in Middle-earth it became apparent\nthat Sauron, Morgoth's chief servant, was still active. He worked with\nElven smiths in Eregion on the craft of rings, and forged the One Ring\nto dominate them all. The Elves noticed this and removed theirs.\n\nTowards the end of the age, the Númenóreans were growing increasingly\nproud. King Ar-Pharazôn humbled even Sauron and brought him to Númenor\nas a hostage. Sauron worked his way into Pharazôn's court, and became\nhigh priest in a cult of Morgoth. Eventually, Pharazôn was persuaded to\nattempt to invade Aman, promised that immortality would result.\n\nAmandil, chief of the Faithful, sailed westward to warn the Valar of\nthis. His son Elendil and grandsons Isildur and Anárion prepared to flee\neastwards. When the King's men had landed on Aman, the Valar lay down\ntheir guardianship of the world and called for Ilúvatar to intervene.\n\nThe world was changed into a sphere, and the straight road from\nMiddle-earth to Aman was broken. Númenor was utterly destroyed, as was\nthe fair body of Sauron. Elendil and his sons founded the realms of\nGondor and Arnor.\n\nSauron arose again and challenged them. The Elves allied with the Men to\nform the Last Alliance, which defeated him. His great One Ring was taken\nfrom him by Isildur but not destroyed.\n\nThird Age\n\n_Main article: Third Age_\n\nThe Third Age saw the rise in power of the realms of Arnor and Gondor,\nand their fall. Arnor was divided into three petty Kingdoms, which fell\none by one, whilst Gondor fell into the civil war of the Kin-strife,\nplague, Wainriders, and the Corsairs of Umbar.\n\nBy the time of _The Lord of the Rings_, Sauron had recovered again, and\nwas seeking the One Ring. He discovered that it was in the possession of\na Hobbit named Baggins, and sent out the Ringwraiths to find him and\nretrieve it.\n\nThe Ring-bearer, Frodo Baggins, is sent to Rivendell, where it is\ndecided that the One Ring must be destroyed once and for all and it can\nonly be unmade in the fiery depths of Mount Doom where it was forged. He\nsets out on this quest with eight other companions who comprise _The\nFellowship of the Ring_.\n\nAfter a long and difficult journey, he and Sam Gamgee finally complete\nthe mission, succeeding largely due to an unforeseen event that was out\nof their control. Sauron is thus destroyed forever and they are lauded\nas heroes.\n\nAragorn takes his place as King of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and\nGondor, at last restoring the line of Kings from the Stewards of Gondor.\n\nFourth Age and After\n\n_Main article: Fourth Age_\n\nThe end of the Third Age marked the end of the involvement of the Elves\nin Human affairs, despite a short-lived revival of Elven presence in\nGondor under Legolas. Most Elves who have lingered in Middle-earth leave\nfor Valinor. Those who remain behind “fade” and eventually diminish; a\nsimilar fate occurs for the Dwarves. Although Lonely Mountain (Erebor)\nbecomes an ally of the Reunited Kingdom, there are indications\nKhazad-dûm is refounded, and a colony is established under Gimli in the\nWhite Mountains (Ered Nimrais). The dwarves become ever more reclusive\nand disappear from human history. Morgoth's creatures are almost wiped\nout and never recover. During the later Fourth Age, as the heirs of the\nNúmenóreans forget their heritage, the tales of the earlier Ages become\nlegends and are eventually considered fantasies.\n\nSince then, Tolkien wrote that the ages have quickened, and he estimated\nthat the 20th century was in the Sixth or Seventh age.\n\nit:Storia di Arda ru:История Арды"

    "text": "The BLUE MOUNTAINS or ERED LUIN, also known as ERED LINDON, was a\nmountain range situated in the far west of Eriador.\n\n\nHistory\n\nEarly Arda\n\nThe Blue Mountains arose sometime after the tumultuous chaos caused by\nMelkor's destruction of the Two Lamps that destroyed the perfect\nsymmetry of Arda. In these early days, the Blue Mountains were located\nbetween the newly formed great sea of Belegaer and the newly formed Sea\nof Helcar. The Blue Mountains were connected to the Iron Mountains to\nthe north and the Red Mountains in the east which formed one great\nmountain range chain known by different names. The Ancient Grey\nMountains were to its south separated by a great gap.\n\nEldar Days\n\nDuring the Years of the Trees and the Sleep of Yavanna, the Blue\nMountains was an unbroken line separating Eriador from Beleriand. Seven\nrivers arose in it on the western side, and the land these rivers flowed\nthrough was known as Ossiriand, which was later also known as Lindon,\ntherefore the mountains were sometimes referred to as the Ered Lindon.\nDwarven kinfolk either awoke here or migrated here from other awakening\npoints and delved the cities of Belegost and Nogrod and made contact and\nalliance with the Sindar of Thingol.\n\nSecond Age\n\nThe mountain range was broken during the war of the Valar against\nMorgoth, and at the middle of the range the sea broke through, creating\na great gap where was set the Gulf of Lune a new terminus for the river\nLune. In the middle of the gap, where the Lune met the sea, the Grey\nHavens of Mithlond of the Elven Kingdom of Lindon were built. When seen\nas the border of Lindon the Ered Luin were called Ered Lindon.\n\n\n\nThird Age and beyond\n\nDuring the Third Age, its forests, besides that of Mirkwood, were the\nlargest in Middle-earth. In the latter part of the Third Age, the\nDwarves settled the Blue Mountains again when Thráin II and his son\nThorin and the Dwarven survivors of the Sack of Erebor moved from\nDunland and delved a prosperous settlement there. After the War of\nthe Ring and the defeat of Sauron, Elves continued to travel west to\nLindon through the gap in the mountains by way of the Gulf of Lune,\nwhere they eventually intended to set sail on the Straight Road to the\nUndying Lands of Aman. After the War of the Ring it is said that many\nDwarves from the east migrated back to their ancient homeland and Ered\nLuin was a prosperous kingdom oncemore.\n\n\nInhabitants\n\nDwarves\n\nThe Blue Mountains, the Iron Hills, and Lonely Mountain were the main\nareas of Dwarf colonization by the late Third Age. During the 4000+\nyears following the cataclysmic sundering and catastrophic downfall of\nBeleriand, when the mighty Dwarf fortress-cities of Nogrod and Belegost\nwere inundated by the sea, it is possible that the Dwarves rebuilt those\ncities to their former splendor.\n\n\n\nThe Dwarves would have plundered the mines of the Blue Mountains for the\nhoard of resources it held within the depths of darkness at its roots. \n\nBefore setting off in their quest to the Lonely Mountain, Thorin\nOakenshield and his twelve other companions (as well as other Dwarves of\nthe Lonely Mountain) resided here in the Blue Mountains after being\nrendered homeless by the Dragon Smaug.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, many Dwarves from the eastern kingdoms\nmigrated back to the Blue Mountains. Their population grew and the Blue\nMountains became a prosperous kingdom once again.\n\nElves\n\nIt is shown in several maps made of Middle-earth that vast ancient\nforests flanked both sides of the Blue Mountains, even after the\ngargantuan slaughter of Eriador's great forests by the men of Númenor\nand their incessant appetite for lumber. These forests, alongside the\nfertile coastal plain, would prove to be hotspots for Elven migration\nand inhabitation.\n\n\n\nIt is stated at the very beginning of _The Hobbit_ that the High Elves\nlived within the vales and forests of the Blue Mountains, presumably\nsharing the land with the Dwarves. To this number would be added Sindar,\nWood-elves, and maybe even a few Avari.\n\nThe influx of new Elven settlers soared after the end of the First Age\nwho lived under the Ñoldor High King Gil-galad in the Second Age.\nAfter the fall of Gil-galad in the Third Age, the foot of the Blue\nMountains became part of Lindon where Elves lived temporarily until they\nleft for the Undying Lands, due to the Elves desiring to escape the woes\nand predicaments of Middle-earth.\n\n\nGeology\n\nAlthough the Blue Mountains were little described (owing to their\nlocation on the fringes of all of Tolkien's tales), we can assume a bit\nof their geology. The outer layers of the mountains seem to have been\nunderlaid by metamorphic rocks formed in contact with numerous igneous\nintrusions. This environment is often necessary to produce veins of ore\nsuch as those mined by the Dwarves from the beginning of time. This\nenvironment produced the trove of Gold, Silver, Iron, Gems, and other\nmaterials that made the Dwarf kingdoms incredibly wealthy.\n\nThe Blue mountains were shorter than the Misty Mountains, and not as\nhigh; their altitude was probably around 3000-4000 meters, on average.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe Sindarin name for the mountains, _ERED LUIN_ is translated as the\nwords _ered_ ('Mountains') and _luin_ ('Blue'). \n",

It is\nnowhere else referred to in the trilogy, so its particular meaning\nremains unclear. _Anor_ is the Elvish word for the Sun, so literally the\n_flame of Anor_ would have alluded to the light of the Sun, which had\noriginated in the fiery fruit of Laurelin, one of the Two Trees of\nValinor. Thus, Gandalf may have meant the power he gained as a servant\n(a Maia) of the Lords of the West, in defiance to the corrupted darkness\nof the Balrog.\n\nAlternatively, Gandalf may have been referring to Narya, the Ring of\nFire, which he wore and wielded, but it seems unlikely that Gandalf\nwould want to reveal his ownership of a Ring of Power —a matter of\nutmost secrecy—to one of his greatest enemies. However, considering that\nthe Balrog owed no allegiance to Sauron at that time, Gandalf may have\nbeen merely attempting to scare it away.\n\nIn Tolkien's earliest drafts, forms of this passage were variations on:\n“I am the master of White Flame. The Red Fire cannot come this way” (and\none variation mixes in the idea of Black Shadow, too). These terms seem\nto be symbolic - _white_ for the powers of good, but _red_ or _black_\nfor Sauron and his servants. As the text developed, the _Red Fire_ and\n_Black Shadow_ were lost. The _White Flame_ remained, but developed into\nthe more poetic _flame of Anor._ On this reading, then, the 'flame of\nAnor' doesn't refer to a specific thing, but is Gandalf's way of\nannouncing what he stands for, or perhaps his power as a servant of the\nValar."

    "text": "THE DOOR OF NIGHT (also called MORITARNON or TARN\nFUI) was a place set at the utmost West of Arda near the Void. The Door\nwas created by the Valar at the time of the making of the Sun and Moon.\nIt was vital in the cosmology of Middle-earth, forming the border\nbetween Arda and the void, as well as being the final prison of the\nrenegade Vala Morgoth Bauglir.\n\n\nCreation\n\nThe Door was created by the Valar as a gateway for the Sun to pass\nthrough. According to others, though, it was made expressly as a gateway\nthrough which to expel Morgoth. The following text describes the\ncreation of the Door in the _Ainulindale_:\n\n  _Thus came it that the Gods dared a very great deed, the most mighty\n  of their works; for making a fleet of magic rafts and boats with\n  Ulmo's aid - and otherwise had none of these endured to sail upon the\n  waters of Vai - they drew to the Wall of Things, and there they made\n  the Door of Night._\n\n\nPurpose\n\nThe Sun was to pass through the Door of Night as it travelled above\nArda. When the Sun passed through the Door, night would fall upon\nMiddle-earth. The Moon would then rise from its resting place and\ncontinue on its path over the Earth. The Sun would traverse the border\nof the Wall of the World, re-entering the world in the East, at the\nGates of Morning. At the same time the Moon would be sinking in the West\nand a new day would begin. At the conclusion of the War of Wrath, when\nEärendil the Mariner sailed to Aman to beseech the aid of the Valar,\nMorgoth was imprisoned outside the Door of Night. The following is told\nin _The Silmarillion_:\n\n  _“But Morgoth himself the Valar thrust through the Door of Night\n  beyond the Walls of the World, into the Timeless Void; and a guard is\n  set forever on those walls, and Eärendil keeps watch upon the ramparts\n  of the sky.”_\n\nAt the “End of Days” (which is referenced to even in _The Lord of the\nRings_ by Gandalf, Tom Bombadil, and others), Morgoth shall return as\nMelkor by breaking the Door of Night, precipitating the Last Battle\n(Dagor Dagorath).\n\n\nLocation\n\nA description of the location of the Door of Night is found in _The Book\nof Lost Tales Part One_:\n\n  _About the World are the Ilurambar, or Walls of the World. They are as\n  ice and glass and steel, being above all the imagination of the\n  Children of Earth cold, transparent, and hard. They cannot be seen,\n  nor can they be passed, save by the Door of Night. Within these walls\n  the Earth is globed: above, below and upon all sides is Vaiya, the\n  Enfolding Ocean.

Its pillars are of the mightiest basalt and its lintel\n  likewise, but great dragons of black stone are carved thereon, and\n  shadowy smoke pours slowly from their jaws._\n\n\nFate\n\nIn the _Book of Lost Tales Part One_ the fate of the Door of Night in\nthe West, and its counterpart, the Gates of Morning in the East, are\ndocumented as follows:\n\n  _For 'tis said ere the Great end come Melko shall in some wise\n  contrive a quarrel between Moon and Sun, and Ilinsor shall seek to\n  follow Urwendi through the Gates, and when they are gone the Gates of\n  both East and West will be destroyed, and Urwendi and Ilinsor shall be\n  lost._"

    "text": "_'_The Book of Lost Tales Part One _'_(sometimes here abbreviated\n_THE BOOK OF LOST TALES 1_) (ISBN 978-0345375216) is the title of the\nfirst volume of Christopher Tolkien's 12-volume series _The History of\nMiddle-earth_, in which he analyses the unpublished manuscripts of his\nfather J. R. R. Tolkien.\n\nIt was completed in 1983. ''The Book of Lost Tales Part Two ''is its\nsequel and other half, which came a year later.\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nContent\n\n_The Book of Lost Tales_ contains the first versions of the stories\nwhich would later become _The Silmarillion_, and is notable because,\nwhile very primitive in style and content, it is very close to the later\nwork in many ways. Each of the Tales is followed by notes and a detailed\ncommentary by Christopher Tolkien.\n\nWhile many of the names in the book are identical or close to those in\nthe later versions, some of them bear almost no resemblance to their\nfinal forms. J. R. R. Tolkien changed names rather frequently, sometimes\nwith several new variants (rejected in turn) written in a single\nmanuscript. Confusingly, sometimes the name applied to one thing is\nlater used to refer to a different thing, the original use abandoned. As\nan example, the house of Elves called “Teleri” in _The Book of Lost\nTales_ is not the same as that in _The Silmarillion_ (see Teleri). The\noriginal usage of “Teleri” would eventually change until the name became\n“Vanyar”. Meanwhile, the house of Elves called “Solosimpi” would inherit\nthe name “Teleri”.\n\nThe framework for the book is that a mortal Man visits the Isle of Tol\nEressëa where the Elves live. In the earlier versions of the “Lost\nTales” this man is named Eriol, of some vague north European origin, but\nin later versions he becomes Ælfwine, an Englishman of the Middle-ages.\n\nThere are more changes visible within the book, and it is not internally\nconsistent, partially because even while still writing it Tolkien began\nrewriting earlier parts as his ideas about the world changed. The Tales\nwere eventually abandoned, but they were resurrected in part as the\n“Sketch of the Mythology” which would become _The Silmarillion_.\n\nFor publication, the book was split into two volumes: _The Book of Lost\nTales Part One_ and _The Book of Lost Tales Part Two_, but this is\nsimply an editorial division. Both volumes are separated into several\n“Lost Tales”, as chapters.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1.  “The Cottage of Lost Play” — the “framework” story, recounting\n    Eriol's arrival to the place where the following stories are told\n2.  “The Music of the Ainur” — the first version of what would become\n    the Ainulindalë\n3.  “The Coming of the Valar and the Building of Valinor” — later\n    Valaquenta and the first chapters of Quenta Silmarillion\n4.  “The Chaining of Melko”\n5.  “The Coming of the Elves and the Making of Kôr”\n6.  “The Theft of Melko and the Darkening of Valinor”\n7.  “The Flight of the Noldoli”\n8.  “The Tale of the Sun and Moon”\n9.  “The Hiding of Valinor”\n10. “Gilfanon's Tale: The Travail of the Noldoli and the Coming of\n    Mankind” (which contains the first and only reference to the\n    enigmatic “wizard” fay, Tu)\n\n\nComparison with The Silmarillion\n\nThe following is a direct comparison between the contents of the early\nBOOK OF LOST TALES and the later sketches that became THE SILMARILLION.\n\nAlthough one of the _Lost Tales_ often corresponds to more tales from\n_The Silmarillion_, still the narrative in the _Lost Tales_ is more\nextended (typically, 50% pages more).\n\nIn J. R. R. Tolkien's notebooks, the 4th and 5th tales were a single one\ntold by Meril-i-Turinqi, but Christopher Tolkien decided to separate\nthem because of their length. The same applies to the 6th and 7th tales,\ntold by Lindo.\n\n+-----------------------------+---------+-----------------------------+\n| The Book of Lost Tales      | _Storyt | The Silmarillion            |\n|                             | eller_  |                             |\n+=============================+=========+=============================+\n|                             |         |                             |\n+-----------------------------+---------+-----------------------------+\n| Book I                      |\n+-----------------------------+---------+-----------------------------+\n| 1.

He created seven\nDwarves, and was teaching them the language he had devised for them.\nWhen Ilúvatar confronted him about what he had done, Aulë offered his\ncreations to Ilúvatar, who accepted them and gave them life.\n\nHowever, the Fathers of the Dwarves had to wait until the Elves first\narrived, and Aulë laid them to rest in various places in the continent\nof Middle-earth.\n\nThe eldest of all, Durin, “lay alone” at Mount Gundabad in the north of\nthe Misty Mountains. He later founded the line of the Longbeards (or\n_Sigin-tarâg_ in Khuzdul), the Dwarves which were most friendly to the\nElves and Men, mostly referred to as Durin's Folk. His city was\nKhazad-dûm.\n\nTwo others were laid to rest near Mount Dolmed in the Blue Mountains,\nand they founded the lines of the Broadbeams and the Firebeards who\nlater lived in Nogrod and Belegost.\n\nThe other four Fathers of Dwarves were laid to rest in the far east, two\nof them at the northern end of the Orocarni, and the other two near the\nsouthern end of the range. These founded the lines of the _Ironfists_\nand _Stiffbeards_, and _Blacklocks_ and _Stonefoots_. No Dwarves of\nthese lines appear in the tales: however, as noted below, the Longbeards\nmay be formed out of Dwarves from all lines, and Dwarves from Durin's\nFolk may therefore have ancestors from these other lines. After the end\nof the First Age, when the ancestral homes of the Broadbeams and\nFirebeards were destroyed, these two lines merged with Durin's Folk, so\nthat Moria had a mixed population, and Thorin Oakenshield grew up in the\nremnants of the Firebeards' halls.\n\nOf the Fathers of the Dwarves, only Durin is said to have “lain alone”.\nThis can be interpreted as referring to the fact he was indeed laid down\nto rest alone while the other Fathers were laid to rest in pairs, but\nolder versions of the story suggest that it meant Durin alone had no\nfemale companion. The other Fathers did: references are made by Tolkien\nto the “Thirteen Dwarves” created by Aulë (Durin and the six pairs). By\nthis version of the story, Durin's Folk was formed out of Dwarves from\nthe other six lines, as a mixed people arose when all Dwarves went to\nGundabad."

Then they found twelve pairs of Elves, and\nEnel, as third eldest, claimed them as his people.\n\nFor many days the now sixty Elves dwelt by the rivers, and they began to\ninvent poetry and music.\n\nFinally they set out again, but Imin thought to himself that since each\ntime they had found more Elves and his folk was least in size, he would\nnow choose last.\n\nThey came across eighteen pairs of Elves, who were watching the stars,\nand Tata and Enel waited for Imin to claim them for his people, but Imin\ntold them he would wait, so Tata added them to his folk. They were tall\nand had dark hair, and they were the fathers of most of the Ñoldor of\nlater times.\n\nThe ninety-six Elves now spoke with each other and invented many new\nwords, but then they continued their journey. Next they found\ntwenty-four pairs of Elves, who were singing without language, and again\nImin was offered the choice, but refused. Therefore Enel chose them as\nhis people, and from them came most of the Lindar or singers of later\ntimes.\n\nAnd the hundred and forty-four Elves now dwelt long together, until all\nhad learned the same language, and they were glad. But then Imin said it\nwas time to seek more companions for him, but most of the others were\ncontent and did not join him. So Imin and Iminyë and their twelve\ncompanions set out alone, and they searched long near Cuiviénen, but\nnever found any more companions.\n\nAnd because all Elves had been found in groups of twelve, twelve became\nthe number they counted with ever after, and 144 was for long their\nhighest number, and in none of their later tongues was there therefore\nany common name for a greater number.\n\nAfter the tale of the Awakening of the Elves the _Companions of Imin_ or\nthe Eldest Company (the later Vanyar) numbered fourteen, and they\nremained the smallest company. The _Companions of Tata_ (half of whom\nbecame the Ñoldor) numbered fifty-six, and they remained the\nsecond-largest company. The _Companions of Enel_ (the later Lindar or\nTeleri) were the largest company, numbering seventy-four.\n\nMelkor was the first to learn of the Awakening. He soon began sending\nevil spirits among the Elves, who planted seeds of doubt against the\nValar. It is also rumoured that some of the Elves were being captured by\na Rider if they strayed too far, and the Elves later believed these were\nbrought to Utumno and twisted into Orcs.\n\nOromë one day came across the Elves, and realized who they were. At\nfirst the Elves were suspicious of him, fearing he was the Rider who\ncaptured the Elves, and because of the lies of Melkor. Nevertheless,\nthree lords of the Elves agreed to come with Oromë to Valinor. These\nwere Ingwë of the _Minyar_ (later _Vanyar_), Finwë of the _Tatyar_\n(later _Ñoldor_), and Elwë of the _Lindar_. In due time, Ingwë, Finwë\nand Elwë returned to Cuivienen, and told the Elves of the glory of\nValinor, and there befell the Sundering of the Elves. All the Minyar and\nhalf of the Tatyar were persuaded, along with most of the Lindar, and\nfollowed Oromë into the west on the Great Journey. These have been known\never since by the name Eldar, or “Star-folk”, which Oromë gave to them\nin their own language. The remainder of the Tatyar and Lindar remained\nsuspicious, or simply refused to depart from their own lands, and spread\ngradually throughout the wide lands of Middle-earth. They were after\nknown by the name Avari, meaning 'the Unwilling', because they refused\nthe summons, in Quenya, the language of the Eldar that eventually\nreached Valinor.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe tale of Imin, Tata and Enel, known as _CUIVIENYARNA_, was a very\nlate writing by Tolkien, written as part of _Quendi and Eldar_. They\nreplaced Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë as the eldest Elves, who now merely\nbecame the first ambassadors and the Kings of the Elves in exile.\n\nit:Risveglio degli Elfi ru:Пробуждение эльфов"

The forest bordered by Dorthonion and was the\nnorthwest border of the Kingdom of Doriath, and lay between the rivers\nTeiglin (west) and Sirion (east). It was a dense, sparsely populated\nBeech forest.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBrethil was probably originally part of Doriath during most of the Years\nof the Trees. When the Girdle of Melian was set after the First Battle,\nthe Forest of Brethil was not included in it and was for the most part\nunsettled. However, King Thingol still held lordship over it.\n\nWhen Men came into the Beleriand, King Thingol gave his permission for\nsome of their peoples to settle there so long as they defended it. It\nwas to Brethil that the House of Haleth removed after dwelling east of\nthe river Gelion, settling mainly on the Hill of Amon Obel where upon\nstood Ephel Brandir, the main feature of the forest. They defended it\nfrom the Orcs until the late fifth century of the First Age, when much\nof their number was lost including their Lord Handir in a raid by the\nenemy. Some Drúedain also dwelt there.\n\nThe Haladin came to Brethil from the lands of Caranthir by way of\nEstolad. They had endured much hardship upon their long journey, but\nbegan to recover and multiply in the isolated forest. There they formed\nan alliance with Elu Thingol, King of Doriath. At need, Thingol sent\nBeleg Cúthalion with great force of his Sindarin Elves west to fight\nalongside Halmir son of Haldan, Lord of the Haladin. The combined force\ndestroyed a legion of Orcs, and the realm had peace for a time. Later,\nmany of the Woodmen of Brethil joined the muster of Húrin son of Galdor,\nclose kin of their lord Haldir, son of Halmir, and took part in the\nNirnaeth Arnoediad.\n\nAfter the disastrous battle, the Haladin became even more reclusive.\nMany withdrew to Ephel Brandir, the home of their lord Brandir the Lame,\nupon Amon Obel. Years later, Túrin Turambar son of Húrin was brought to\nEphel Brandir, and became the de facto lord of the Haladin. The tragedy\nof the Children of Hurin ensnared the Haladin, and the forest was\neventually attacked by Glaurung, father of Dragons. He burnt a path\ndirectly towards Ephel Brandir, but Túrin managed to slay him at\nCabed-en-Aras upon Teiglin with his mighty sword Gurthang. Returning\ntowards Ephel Brandir, Túrin learned the truth about his wife Níniel,\nand he, Níniel and Brandir all perished. The final stroke of doom for\nthe Haladin in Brethil came when Húrin returned to Amon Obel and sparked\na civil war, which destroyed the bloodline of the House of Haldad.\n\nTúrin Turambar came here after the destruction of Nargothrond and a\nvisit to Dor-lómin to rest not long before his fight with Glaurung. The\nForest was Túrin's burial place as well Nienor Níniel and Morwen, as\nwell as the Haudh-en-Elleth, the mound of Finduilas. The grave of Túrin\nand Morwen, survived the ruin of Beleriand after the First Age, and thus\ndid a speck of the Forest of Brethil still exist as Tol Morwen.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Brethil_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Silver birch'."

Legolas\nremembered and sang the tragic tale of Amroth and Nimrodel.\n\nWhen Durin's Bane, the Balrog of Moria, was awakened, an evil arose that\nbegan to surround the peaceful forest of Lothlorien. This became too\nmuch for Nimrodel to bare. She and her love, the King of Lothlorien,\nAmroth, began their journey southwards towards the sea and the undying\nlands. Nimrodel became lost in the White Mountains and perished never\nfinding her way to Amroth who waited upon a boat tethered to the shore\nnear Belfalas. A storm arose, driving the boat out to sea. In\ndesperation and love, Amroth lept from the boat to swim to shore, hoping\nto find Nimrodel, yet drowned in the dark stormy waters of the ocean.\nBoth lovers died painfully yearning to find each other. In this way\nsorrow first came to the land of Lorien.\n\nUntil the days of the Fellowship, the singing of Nimrodel could be heard\nin the falls near where she lived. The voice of Amroth can similarly be\nheard when the wind blows into Lorien from the south, where he had\ndrowned. It is in the mingling of the waters of the stream of Nimrodel,\nwith the waters of the Anduin and eventually the ocean, the two lovers\nare symbolically united.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring stopped at Cerin Amroth as they were being\nescorted through Lórien to the Lord and Lady in Caras Galadhon by\nHaldir. Frodo could feel the southern wind blow upon Cerin Amroth,\ncarrying the sounds and sights of the southern ocean.\n\nFrodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee followed Haldir up to the flet built in the\ncenter tree while the others rested in the grass. Frodo saw Caras\nGaladhon from the flet. He could see Anduin the Great and Southern\nMirkwood corrupted by Dol Guldur.\n\nReturning to the grass at the foot of Cerin Amroth, Frodo finds Aragorn\nplaying with an elanor flower, lost in memory. He sees him as if clothed\nin white as a young lord tall and fair, speaking elvish to someone he\ncannot see. Aragorn speaks in Elvish “fair Arwen, fairwell” then looks\ntowards Frodo and smiles.\n\nIt was here where Arwen, after Aragorn's death, went to die, in the\nplace Aragorn had proposed to her, sometime before the spring of FO 121\nand was where her grave was located."

Angband was also delved into these mountains\nwest of Utumno. After Melkor's destruction of the Two Lamps, the Iron\nMountains were connected to the Blue Mountains of the West to the\nOrocarni of the east. Much later when the Valar decided to protect\nthe Elves from Melkor by defeating him and imprisoning him, the changing\nof the shape of Middle-earth effected the Iron Mountains as well.\nAfterwards, the mountain range was distorted but was still long with\nlengths stretching from the Helcaraxë in the far northwest to the\nOrocarni in the far east and rising to immense and frighting heights,\nwith enormous peaks such as Thangorodrim.\n\nIn the days of the War of the Jewels, the mountains protected Morgoth\nfrom being outflanked from the rear and with no enemy behind him, he was\nable to concentrate on the south. Because of its perilous heights,\nfrightening looks, and foul winds, no Elf ever passed through the\nmountains for any reason but the spies of Morgoth would always find ways\ninto the Beleriand, by unknown ways through the mountains. Morgoth's\nforces also captured Elves and brought them through the mountains to\nAngband.\n\nAfter the War of Wrath the Iron Mountains and Thangorodrim were\ndestroyed and the vast mountain chain was broken and disappeared for a\ngreat part of their length. North of the range lay the Forodwaith, a\nregion of ever-lasting cold. Remnants of the great mountain range in the\nThird Age included the Mountains of Angmar in northern Eriador, as well\nas the Ered Mithrin and the Iron Hills of northern Rhovanion. The\nIron Mountains remained unchanged after the Change of the World and ever\nafter. The only people known to have lived in the cold climates\nof the Forodwaith were a Mannish people known as the Lossoth, the\ndescendants of the people known as the Forodwaith who once lived in the\narea around the Iron Mountains of the Ice-Bay of Forochel.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe _Iron Mountains_ was known as the 'Ered Engrin' in Sindarin which\nmeant 'Mountains of Iron'."

On the western slopes of the Orocarni grew\nthe _Wild Wood_, near a great waterfall of a river that flowed into the\nInland Sea of Helcar where the bay of Cuiviénen lay, where the Elves\nwoke.

    "text": "The TWO TREES OF VALINOR also known as the TREES OF THE VALAR,''' '''the\nTWO TREES: '''Laurelin '''(the Gold Tree) and '''Telperion '''(the\nSilver Tree), brought light into the Land of the Valar in ancient times.\nThey were destroyed by Melkor and Ungoliant, but their last flower and\nfruit were made by the Valar into the Sun and the Moon.\n\n\nCreation and destruction\n\nThe first sources of light for all of Arda were two enormous Lamps,\nIlluin, the silver one to the north, and Ormal, the golden one to the\nsouth. These were cast down and destroyed by Melkor. Afterward, the\nValar went to Valinor and Yavanna sang into existence the Two Trees,\nsilver Telperion and golden Laurelin. Telperion was considered male and\nLaurelin female. The Trees sat on the hill Ezellohar located outside\nValimar. They grew in the presence of all of the Valar, watered by the\ntears of Nienna.\n\n Each tree was a source of\nlight: Telperion's silver and Laurelin's gold. Telperion had dark leaves\n(silver on one side) and his silvery dew was collected as a source of\nwater and of light. Laurelin had gold-trimmed leaves and her dew was\nlikewise collected by Varda. One “day” lasted twelve hours. Each Tree,\nin turn, would give off light for seven hours (waxing to full brightness\nand then slowly waning again), so that at one hour each of “dawn” and\n“dusk” soft gold and silver light would be given off together.\n\nJealous, Melkor enlisted the help of the giant spider-creature Ungoliant\n(the mother of Shelob) to destroy the Two Trees. Concealed in Unlight,\nMelkor struck each Tree and the insatiable Ungoliant devoured whatever\nlife and light remained in them.\n\nAgain Yavanna sang and Nienna wept, but they succeeded only in reviving\nTelperion's last flower (to become the Moon) and Laurelin's last fruit\n(to become the Sun). These were assigned to lesser spirits, male Tilion\nand female Arien, after the 'genders' of the Trees themselves. This\nis why, in _The Lord of the Rings_, the Sun is usually referred to as\n“she” and the moon as “he”.\n\nHowever, the true light of the Trees, before their poisoning by\nUngoliant, was said to afterwards reside only in the Silmarils.\n\n\nTelperion's descendants\n\nBecause the Elves that first came to Valinor especially loved Telperion,\nYavanna made a second tree like it to stand in the city of Tirion where\nthe Vanyar and Ñoldor dwelt together at first. This tree,\nnamed Galathilion, was identical to Telperion except that it gave no\nlight of its own. It had many seedlings, one of which was planted in the\nisle of Tol Eressëa (named CELEBORN).\n\nIn the Second Age, a seedling of Celeborn was brought as a gift to the\nNúmenóreans - this was Nimloth, the White Tree of Númenor. It lasted\nthrough the majority of the realm's duration, but when Sauron took\ncontrol of the island he commanded King Ar-Pharazôn to chop it down.\n\nFortunately Isildur managed to save a single fruit of that tree. Of this\nfruit later came the White Tree of Gondor.\n\n\nInternal significance\n\nThe Two Trees of Valinor existed at a time when the only other source of\nlight was the stars (which had been created for the Elves' benefit by\nVarda from the dews collected from the Two Trees). When three Elven\nambassadors were brought to see Valinor for themselves, in order that\nthe Elves might be convinced to come to Valinor, it seems that the Two\nTrees affected them most significantly.\n\nIn particular Thingol is said to have been motivated in the Great\nJourney by his desire to see the Light of Valinor again (until he finds\ncontentment in the light he sees in Melian's face). Also in later times,\nthe Elves would be divided between the _CALAQUENDI_ who had seen the\nlight of the Trees, and the _MORIQUENDI_ who hadn't; with the former\ngroup having found enlightenment and near rapture in the light they\nbeheld.\n\nThe Silmarillion repeatedly states that those Elves who saw the Two\nTrees were mighty, with the light of Aman in their faces. As vassals of\nthe Valar, the trees somehow bestowed otherworldy power and\nunderstanding on those who were exposed to them. Galadriel in particular\nhad an affinity to Laurelin, as her hair was said to have captured the\ngolden light of that tree. In turn this inspired Feanor to make the\njewels that could hold that same light; the Silmarils.\n\nThe whole of the history of the First Age is strongly affected by the\ndesire of many different characters to possess the Silmarils, which\ncontain the only remaining unsullied light of the Trees. Yet upon his\nflight from Valinor after destroying the light of the Two Trees, Melkor\nstole the Silmarils and sparked the Oath of Fëanor (who renamed Melkor\nMorgoth) and after many years the Valar embarked on the War of Wrath,\nWhich ended the First Age\n\nIn the Second and Third Ages, the White Trees of Númenor and of Gondor,\nwhose likeness descends from that of Telperion, have a mostly symbolic\nsignificance. They stand both as symbols of the kingdoms in question,\nand also as reminders of the ancestral alliance between the Dúnedain and\nthe Elves. Even in this late age the two trees are remembered by some.\nGandalf obviously remembers them with reverence, as he speaks of them to\nPippin.\n\n\nExternal significance\n\nTolkien, as a Roman Catholic, would have been exposed to the\nsignificance of light in Catholic symbolism. Trees were of special\nimportance to him - in his short story _Leaf by Niggle_, which in a\nsense was an elaborate allegory explaining his own creative process, the\nprotagonist spends his life painting a single Tree.\n\nThe Two Trees represent the recurrent 'gold and silver' concept of the\nlegendarium. They are created after the lamps Ormal and Illuin - and\nfrom the trees themselves, the Sun and Moon are later created.\n\nTolkien may have also gotten inspiration for the trees directly from the\nSun, which rises in the day (as Laurelin, the golden tree), and the moon\nwhich rises in the night (Telperion, the silver tree).\n\n\nEtymology\n\nBoth Telperion and Laurelin are said to have been given many names among\nwhich are the following: Laurelin was also given the names of MALINALDA\nand CULÚRIEN,''' '''while Telperion was also named '''Silpion '''and\nNINQUELÓTË. Telperion's name in Valarin, the language of the Valar, is\nsaid to have been _IBRÎNIÐILPATHÂNEZEL_; Laurelin's name is recorded as\n_TULUKHEDELGORÛS._\n\nIn early writings of Tolkien, Telperion's names were SILPION ,\nBANSIL, and BELTHIL.\n\n\nQuotations\n\n“Yet even as hope failed  Telperion bore at last upon a leafless\nbough one great flower of silver, and Laurelin a single fruit of gold.”\n- _The Silmarillion_\n\n“... and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of Feanor at their\nwork, while both the White Tree and Golden were in flower!” Gandalf to\nPippin, _The Two Towers_\n\n\nNotes\n\n-   Tolkien could have taken the creation of light mentioned in Genesis\n    as inspiration for the two trees, as both brought light into\n    Middle-earth and were turned into the moon and sun.",

The stars were the\nconstellation Durin's Crown which the elves call Valacirca and men call\nthe Big Bear. Because of this sign Durin chose to build his great hall\nMoria in the mountains above that vale. The name Kheled-zâram is in\nKhuzdul and means “Glass-lake”.

When the Sons of\nFëanor heard that the inheritor of the throne of Doriath, they demanded\nthat he surrender it to them or become their enemy.

It was attacked and besieged many times during\nthe First Age by the forces of Morgoth. When Men came into the service\nof the Ñoldor, it was entrusted to the House of Hador. It survived the\nDagor Bragollach but was conquered and occupied by the enemy after the\nNirnaeth Arnoediad.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBarad Eithel guarded a pass over the Ered Wethrin into Hithlum, the\nrealm of Fingolfin, the High King of the Ñoldor. There were several\nmountain fortresses along the eastern border, but Barad Eithel was\nFingolfin's primary stronghold. Cavalry based at Barad Eithel patrolled\nthe plains of Ard-galen.\n\nDuring the Dagor Bragollach in FA 455, rivers of fire from Angband\nturned the grassy plain of Ard-galen into Anfauglith. The Elves of\nHithlum and their allies the Men of Dor-lómin were driven back to the\nmountain forts.\n\nDuring the Siege of Angband, Barad Eithel lay at the heart of the\nNoldor's defences, and also guarded the passes westward into Hithlum.\nThroughout the siege, Elves of Fingolfin's people would patrol the green\nfields of Ard-galen, holding Morgoth within his fortress at Angband,\nclose by to the north.\n\nThat changed in the Dagor Bragollach, when the plains of Ard-galen were\noverrun with rivers of fire and turned to scorching dust. Armies of Orcs\nassailed Fingolfin's city, but it held firm, though Hador, the Lord of\nDor-lómin and his younger son Gundor were both lost in its defence, in\nfront of the fortress's walls. Looking out across the burning desert in\ndespair, Fingolfin set out from Barad Eithel to challenge Morgoth to\nsingle combat, and was lost. His son Fingon became the High King of the\nÑoldor in his place, and took up his rule from Eithel Sirion.\n\n\n\nThough the Siege of Angband had been broken, Barad Eithel still held,\nand so the passes into Hithlum remained secure. Morgoth resolved to\nbreak this defence, and sent another army seven years after the Dagor\nBragollach to overcome Fingon's forces. Again they were repulsed, but\nGaldor was slain in the attack, where his father Hador had fallen just\nseven years before. Galdor was killed by an arrow. His son Húrin then,\ndrove the enemy forces back from Barad Eithel and pursued them across\nAnfauglith.\n\nWhen the Elves came together for a vast new assault on Morgoth, Barad\nEithel was the staging post for the western armies. It was from there\nthat the soldiers of Fingon swept across the dusty remnant of Ard-galen,\nin the glorious beginning of the battle that would turn to the tragedy\nof the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. Gelmir's brother Gwindor was on the outworks\nof Barad Eithel, and in his anger he launched a premature attack against\nMorgoth's forces. Fingon ordered his troops to follow and advance on\nAngband, but despite their initial success they were ultimately defeated\nin the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Fingon was killed and no Elves returned to\nHithlum, which Morgoth gave to the Easterlings.\n\nThough the fate of Barad Eithel in that battle is polemical described,\nthe fact that Fingon's realm was destroyed and Hithlum occupied must\nmean that the fortress at Eithel Sirion was captured or destroyed. By\nthe last years of the First Age, if Fingolfin's mountain fortress was\nnot in the hands of the Orcs, it would have fallen into ruin and\ndecay.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _BARAD EITHEL_ means “Tower of the Well” in Sindarin from\n_barad_ meaning “tower” and _eithel_ meaning “well, spring”."

Men and Dwarves seemed to prefer living in walled cities and\ntowns or underground, and generally cut down trees for their\nmetallurgical work, usually in moderation. A few exceptions include the\nearly Fallohides living in the forested areas near the Misty Mountains\nand the Drúedain living in the forest of the same name.

During the Years of the Trees when the Valar removed to Aman,\nthe first real and dense forests arose and spread throughout\nMiddle-earth in parts of the Beleriand, in Eriador where a vast forest\nreigned for many thousands of years, and some in the land of Rhovanion\nwhere Greenwood stood. The vast lands of the south of Middle-earth and\nmuch of the Dark Land where very few people lived also had many dense\nforested areas. All forests in the Beleriand perished with its\ndestruction at the end of the First Age.\n\nSecond Age\n\nThe vast primordial forests in Eriador stood until the middle of this\nage when the Númenóreans began cutting them down to built their fleets\nand fuel their desire for empire and dominion. Then when Sauron declared\nwar in SA 1693 much of the forested area in Eriador was burned to the\nground or extensively damaged.\n\nThird Age\n\nBy the Third Age all that remained of the vast forests of Eriador were\nFangorn forest and the Old Forest both of which were guarded by the Ents\nand Tom Bombadil. When Sauron reestablished himself in TA 1050 and moved\nto Dol Guldur, Greenwood became evil and perilous and was unsafe to\nenter save in secret.\n\nFourth Age and Beyond\n\nWith the defeat of Sauron in the War of the Ring and the clearing of Dol\nGuldur, Mirkwood was freed from evil and Men and Elves worked to restore\nit to its former beauty.

Only with his kin in\nNargothrond did Thingol remain in contact with. He did not take part in\nany of the later Battles of Beleriand relating to the struggle with\nMorgoth.\n\nSometime during mid First Age, Beren Erchamion asked Thingol's\ndaughter, Lúthien, for her hand in marriage, but the King demanded that\nBeren was to go on a quest to retrieve a Silmaril from Morgoth's Iron\nCrown. Lúthien accompanied him on the quest to Angband and they\nsucceeded in eventually retrieving the jewel; but the stakes were high.\nCarcharoth, a wolf guarding the Gates of Angband, bit off Beren's hand\nin which he was holding the Silmaril. The wolf ventured to Menegroth,\nravaging the lands in his path, and broke through its boundaries. He was\nconfronted by the brave Huan, the Great Hound of Valinor, on the\nnorth-east banks of Esgalduin and was killed in the brawl. The Silmaril\nwas found in the wolf's stomach, after swallowing it in Beren's hand,\nand was given to King Thingol.\n\nSack of Doriath\n\nYears later, Hurin Thalion brought the famed Nauglamir as a gift to\nThingol. Thingol contemplated a plan to set the Silmaril into the\nNauglamir. He offered a reward to the Dwarven craftsmen of Nogrod if\nthey succeeded in setting the stone into the Nauglamir. A great desire\nfor the Silmaril possessed the Dwarves and they formed a greed to own\nboth the jewel and the Nauglamir. They finished the work and\nsubsequently claimed the treasure for themselves, slew Thingol, and fled\nMenegroth. \n\nThe news spread fast and the Dwarves were hunted for and then slain. Two\nescaped and and told a tale of lies about their ''betrayal ''and their\nbrethren being _slaughtered_ by the Elves._ _The Dwarves of Nogrod\nformed a great army and rose in anger at the elves and invaded the now\nunguarded Doriath._ _This led to the Battle of the Thousand Caves_ _in\nwhich many were slain on both sides. Mablung, the leader of the guard,\nwas slaughtered at the doors of the treasure chamber where the Nauglamir\nwas held. The Dwarves of Nogrod were then waylaid at Sarn Athrad on\ntheir return by the Laiquendi led by Beren. Their King was slain by\nBeren in single combat and the remainder of their host were felled by\nEnts.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_MENEGROTH_ is a Sindarin word.\n\n\nLay of Leithian\n\n ...through corridors of carven dread whose turns were lit by lanterns\nhung or flames from torches that were flung on dragons hewn in the cold\nstone with jewelled eyes and teeth of bone. Then sudden, deep beneath\nthe earth the silences with silver mirth were shaken and the rocks were\nringing, the birds of Melian were singing; and wide the ways of shadows\nspread as into arched halls she led Beren in wonder. There a light like\nday immortal and like night of stars unclouded, shone and gleamed. A\nvault of topless trees it seemed, whose trunks of carven stone there\nstood like towers of an enchanted wood in magic fast for ever bound,\nbearing a roof whose branches wound in endless tracery of green lit by\nsome leaf-imprisoned sheen of moon and sun, and wrought of gems, and\neach leaf hung on golden stems. Lo! there amid immortal flowers the\nnightingales in shining bowers sang o'er the head of Melian, while water\nfor ever dripped and ran from fountains in the rocky floor. There\nThingol sat. His crown he wore of green and silver, and round his chair\na host in gleaming armour fair...\n\n    ―_Lay of Leithian, lines 981-1011_",

The host of Fingolfin, which had been betrayed by\nFëanor in Aman, had managed the near-impossible crossing of the\nHelcaraxë and had arrived in Middle-earth, its members bitter and\nfurious. However, after being rescued by Fingon from captivity, Feanor's\neldest son Maedhros had relinquished any claim to the Kingship of the\nÑoldor to Fingolfin, to whom it should have passed regardless. This act\nunited the Ñoldor and allowed them to establish mighty kingdoms in\nMiddle-earth while Morgoth's forces still reeled from the unveiling of\nthe light of the Sun and the Moon.\n\nEventually however, Morgoth's forces overcame their fear of these new\nlights, and the Iron Mountains spewed forth fire as Morgoth sent forth\nnumerous small bands of Orcs, which passed through the Pass of Sirion\nand Maglor's Gap. Fighting small battles along the way, they penetrated\ndeep in West and East Beleriand, where they were destroyed by southern\nforces of the Ñoldor and Elves under Círdan of the Falas.\n\nDoriath was shut and its people refused to fight, and the Laiquendi of\nOssiriand fought no more battles after their leader had been killed in\nthe First Battle of Beleriand.\n\nMeanwhile, the main force of the Orcs spewed forth from Angband to\nDorthonion, where the twins Angrod and Aegnor held them off until armies\nunder Fingolfin and Maedhros counter-attacked on the plains of Lothlann\nand Ard-galen, trapping the Orcs between them. There was an envelopment\nand the Orcs were caught in the vice of Fingolfin from the west and\nMaedhros from the east. Most Orcs were destroyed, and they retreated to\nAngband. The Ñoldor pursued, and utterly destroyed their enemies in\nsight of the gates of Angband.\n\nThis was the first complete victory over Morgoth, and after it the\nÑoldor maintained a guard on Angband, beginning the period of watchful\npeace known as the Siege of Angband.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_DAGOR AGLAREB_ is Sindarin for 'Glorious Battle'.",

The founders of the\nHavens were a group of Teleri who chose to stay in Middle-earth for\ntheir love of the coasts and the sea, thus they did not move on to Aman\nas some of their kin did. The people of these settlements became known\nas the Falathrim and their leader was Círdan the Shipwright. After\nsometime, two main walled settlements where built and these were the\ncities of Eglarest built at the mouth of the river Nenning, and\nBrithombar, to the north of Eglarest, built at the mouth of the river\nBrithon.\n\nWhen Morgoth opened his first assault on the Beleriand, the Havens came\nunder siege that lasted until the Return of the Ñoldor after which the\nattacking Orcs were ordered north to fight the Ñoldor in the\nDagor-nuin-Giliath. After FA 45, West Beleriand was ruled by from\nNargothrond by Finrod Felagund, with Círdan as an ally. The Havens of\nthe Falas survived until the later Battles of Beleriand until they\nfinally fell by the year FA 473.

Though called a\nsiege, this containment was not technically a siege at all as the Elves\nand Edain were unable to actually assault Angband; they were merely able\nto battle Morgoth's Orcs when they chose to emerge.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe encirclement of Angband was incomplete, as Morgoth was still capable\nof sending out various forces of Orcs to weaken the Ñoldor (such as the\nattack of Hithlum), mainly from the impassable north flanks of the\nfortress near the unguarded Iron Mountains. The Ñoldor had grown strong\nenough, however, and these raiding forces posed no significant threat.\nBut these raids enabled Morgoth to coerce people who were captured to\nhis service, which would later prove very disastrous to the Ñoldor and\ntheir allies.\n\nThough considered by Fingolfin, the Elves never planned in earnest nor\nexecuted any sort of offensive action against Angband. The Elven\nkingdoms had prospered greatly during the time of the siege, and most\nwere unwilling to engage in a seemingly needless battle in which they\nbelieved innumerable Elves would perish, whether in victory or defeat.\nThe Elves in fact did not have the ability to overthrow Angband no\nmatter what they did, but at the time, Fingolfin did not fully\ncomprehend the power of Morgoth.

Their first independent King was Meneldil, the nephew\nof Isildur, whose line ruled over Gondor for more than two thousand\nyears. Unlike their cousins in the North, the Dúnedain of the South\nmaintained their realm even after the loss of its Kings, and it survived\nunder the rule of the Stewards until the time of the War of the Ring,\nwhen the Kingship was restored.\n\n\nDescription and Historical accounts\n\nBeing mostly of Númenórean stock and ruled by exiled Númenórean\noverlords, the Men of Gondor continued most of the customs and\ntraditions of Númenór. However, over the centuries, they mixed more and\nmore with the men of Middle-earth. One of these peoples was the Northmen\nwho lived in Rhovanion, and Gondor, ever needing allies, began\nacquainting themselves with these men by the mid Third Age. Brave and\nvaliant, but by the standards of the Dúnedain shorter lived, the\nNorthmen gradually had more and more to do with Gondor, and one of its\nheirs to the throne, Valacar, who lived and worked with them in their\nown land as an ambassador, married one of their noble ladies, setting\nthe stages for the Kin-strife. \n\nOver the next few hundred years afterward, war, rebellion, and plague\nseverally weakened the blood of the Dúnedain in Gondor. Their rulers\nthough survived and retained many of the ancient customs. As the\ncenturies rolled on into the late Third Age, the Men of Gondor\naccustomed to war and invasion became a hardy and stern people more\nlikened to Middle-earth. They became summed up in the phrase, “when\nheads are at a loss, bodies must serve.”\n\nBy the time of just before War of the Ring, the Men of Gondor grappled\nconstantly with the forces of Mordor giving and regaining ground to the\nDark Lord's armies. Their leader Denethor II could foresee nothing but a\nvictory in single combat on the battlefield against him or total doom,\nso when it became clear that Sauron's lost Ring of Power had been found,\nhe and people like his son and others wanted the Ring to be taken by\nGondor and be used against the enemy as a weapon. The Men of Gondor were\nspared the folly of this choice when Denethor's youngest son Faramir let\nFrodo and Sam continue to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring.\n\nAfter the war was won and Aragorn II Elessar was crowned, the Men of\nGondor were rekindled with the ancient tradition of the Dúnedain of old\nwhen Elendil founded the Two Kingdoms with his two sons: Isildur and\nAnárion. They thrived and prospered as part of the Reunited Kingdom into\nFourth Age and beyond.\n\n\nNotable Men of Gondor\n\nImage:Seanbean boromir.jpg|Boromir Image:Faramir3.jpg|Faramir\nImage:Denethor.jpg|Denethor II",

The pass itself is somewhat narrow, but wide enough to have a\nlarge hill within it and a small stream.\n\nThe city of Tirion was set on the hill of Túna, which is between the\nCalacirya closest to the light of Valinor.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the pass was created, there was no way to get into Valinor but\nwhen the Quendi began their journey westward towards the Blessed Realm,\nthey eventually were not able to enter due to The Pelóri blocking the\nway, so the Valar opened a narrow pass in the great mountains. The Valar\nwould have preferred to closed the mountains entirely but, realizing\nthat the elves, even the Vanyar, needed to be able to breath the outside\nair, they kept Calacirya open.\n\nThey also did not want to wholly separate the Vanyar and Ñoldor from the\nTeleri on the coast. The Valar then opened the pass in the side of The\nPelóri and the Noldor and Vanyar entered and resided in the city of\nTirion, which is set right in the middle of the pass. The Teleri did not\nleave the island of Tol Eressëa until much later and even then, they did\nnot enter Valinor but stayed rather on the eastern coast of Aman under\nthe afternoon shadow of The Pelóri in a city named Alqualondë.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Calacirya_ is a Quenyan word that meant 'Cleft of Light'. Earlier forms\nof the word were 'Kalakirya' and 'Kalakilya'. Later forms were and\n'Kalakiryan' and 'Calaciryan'."
