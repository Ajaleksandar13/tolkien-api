    "text": "AULË (Quenya; IPA: - “Invention”) was an Ainur, one of the Aratar and a\nValar, who was responsible for fashioning and crafting the substances of\nwhich Arda, the world, was composed. He was also called '''Mahal\n'''(Khuzdul; IPA: “Maker”), '''Oli '''(Sindarin; IPA: “Dream”) or\nNÁVATAR and delights in the nature of substances and in works of skill,\nbut not concerned with possession or mastery. Besides the shaping of\nArda, Aulë's greatest works were the Two Lamps of the Valar, the vessels\nof the Sun and Moon, and the Dwarves, whom he created out of impatience\nfor the Children of Ilúvatar. He also created Angainor (the chain of\nMelkor).\n\n\nBiography\n\nAs Aulë was a smith, he was the Valar most similar in thought and powers\nto Melkor, in that they each gloried in the fashioning of artful and\noriginal things. Both also came to create beings of their own. But while\nAulë strove to be true to the original intent of the Music of the\nAinurs, and submitted all that he did to the will of Ilúvatar, Melkor\nwished to control and subvert all things, and was jealous of the\ncreations of others so that he would try to twist or destroy all that\nthey made. There was long strife between Aulë and Melkor both before and\nafter the creation of Arda. Aulë, however, traditionally opposed\nattempts to fight Melkor, for fear of the damage that would be wrought\nto Arda.\n\nWhen the Elves came to Valinor, the Ñoldor became the students of Aulë.\nFëanor was his greatest pupil, and from him learned to make gems through\ncraftsmanship that is now forgotten. This would eventually lead to the\nSilmarils, the greatest creation of handiwork within Arda. On the Flight\nof the Noldor, the Noldor who returned to Valinor under Finarfin named\nthemselves the _Aulendur_, Followers of Aulë. Despite his lordly skill,\nAulë was humble and compassionate, and indeed the Dwarves survived only\nbecause Aulë submitted them to the will of Ilúvatar. His spouse was\nYavanna, with whom he dwelt in central Valinor.\n\nThe Creation of the Dwarves\n\n\n\nDesperate for pupils onto whom he could pass his knowledge, and\nunwilling to wait for the emergence of the Children of Ilúvatar, Aulë\ncreated his own race of beings, the dwarves. However, he did not have a\nclear idea of what the Children of Ilúvatar would be like, and because\nof the presence of the chaos caused by Melkor, Aulë made the Dwarves\nstrong and unyielding, and not willing to endure the domination of\nothers, as well as embodying some of his values and desires for\nMiddle-earth. However Aulë did not have the power to give independent\nlife to his creations, they could act only when his thought was on them.\n\nWhen Aulë completed his work he began to instruct the Dwarves in a\nlanguage he had made for them, Khuzdul. Then Ilúvatar spoke to Aulë,\nasking why he would seek to exceed his power and authority by attempting\nto make new life. Aulë repented, answering that the drive to create was\nkindled in him by Ilúvatar, and that he only wished for other beings to\nlove and teach, with whom to share in the beauty of the world. He\nadmitted that his impatience had driven him to folly and submitted his\ncreations to Ilúvatar. Assuming that they should be destroyed, he made\nto smite the seven Fathers of the Dwarves with a great hammer.  As he\nraised the hammer the Dwarves shrank from the coming blow, but Ilúvatar\nstayed Aulë's hand and showed that he had accepted Aulë's offer by\ngifting the Dwarves with spirits of their own, else they could not have\nbeen afraid.\n\nIlúvatar accepted the Dwarves as his adopted children however, as it was\nordained that the elves were to be the first-born race, Ilúvatar set the\nDwarves to sleep until after the Awakening of the Elves. He told Aulë\nthat while both were his children, their creation was outside the scope\nof the Music of the Ainur, and strife would arise between the Dwarven\nrace and the Elven race as the events of the world unfolded. The Dwarves\nbelieve that after they die their spirits move to halls that Aulë has\nset aside for them alone, and that their role will be to rebuild Arda\nafter the Final Battle.\n\n\nMaiar of Aulë\n\n-   Mairon (Sauron), the mightiest of the Maiar of Aulë who used his\n    knowledge of the metaphysical structure of Arda to great effect as a\n    servant of Melkor in the First Age of Middle-earth and then was his\n    own master in the Second and Third Ages. When Sauron sought to\n    corrupt the elves in the Second Age one of the names he assumed was\n    Aulendil, meaning devotee of Aulë.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Curumo (Saruman), the leader of the wizards sent to lead the people\n    of Middle-earth against Sauron, only to betray his fellow wizards\n    and ally with Sauron himself (who he also betrayed in the end).\n\nIt is interesting to note that two of the greatest Maiar sent to\nMiddle-earth, that fell, were in the beginning both aligned with Aulë.\nThe reason for this is probably that this is the order most associated\nwith craft, skill, and by these means, power. Weaker-willed spirits\noften fall prey to craving for power in Tolkien's works, and these prove\nno exception. Also, Tolkien generally sees industry as corruption. It\nseems Maiar of Aulë are the most powerful Maia because they are the\nclosest to Ilúvatar's creation skills.\n\n\nPowers\n\nAulë seems to have a power most akin to Ilúvatar's - he can create an\ninnumerable amount of things. He made the Two Lamps, and made Angainor,\nMorgoth's chain. Although he does not have access to the Flame\nImperishable, he was able to create life (although it does not have free\nwill). As a Valar, he possesses incredible strength, and has been noted\nto have rebuilt Arda during and after Morgoth's period of destruction\nbefore the coming of the Elves. He likely forged the Valar's weaponry\nand armor for the War of Wrath. His strength is in the construction of\nnew things, and he is as near to the antithesis of the destructive\nMorgoth as one can be.﻿\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Aulë_ means ''invention ''in Quenya.\n\n_Mahal_ means ''maker ''in Khuzdul.\n\n_Oli_ means _dream_ in Sindarin.",

Facing final defeat, Morgoth unleashed his last and greatest\nweapon; a fleet of winged fire drakes, led by Ancalagon. So terrible was\ntheir onslaught that the armies of the Valar were driven back from the\ngates of Angband, and their coming was said to have been accompanied by\na tempest of fire and lightning. But Eärendil came out of the West in\nhis blessed ship Vingilot, accompanied by the Eagles of Manwë led by\nThorondor. The Eagles and Eärendil dueled with Ancalagon and the other\nDragons for an entire day. Eventually, Eärendil was victorious, casting\nAncalagon down upon Thangorodrim and destroying the volcanic mountains\nin his fall. The death of Ancalagon marked the end of Morgoth's final\nresistance.\n\nLater mentions\n\nGandalf spoke of him as he told Frodo the true origin of his Ring. “It\nhas been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of\nPower, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old\nfire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon\nthe Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that\nwas made by Sauron himself.”\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Ancalagon_ is Sindarin, meaning “Rushing Jaws” from _anca_\n(“jaws”) and the root _alak-_ (“rushing”).\n\nOther Names\n\nThe Middle English translation for _Ancalagon_ is ANDRACCA, from _and-_\n(“opposition”), _anda_ (“hatred, envy”), and _draca_ (“dragon”).\n\n\nCharacter\n\nAncalagon's size is not specified, but must have been colossal due to\nthe destruction of “the towers of Thangorodrim”, which are elsewhere\nidentified with the three smoking peaks of the mountain. He was however,\nsaid to be as big as a mountain. However, his size is never directly\nspecified and some powerful but small creatures are able to cause great\ndestruction even in death, such as Durin's Bane breaking the slopes of\nCelebdil.

    "title": "The Fellowship of the Ring (group)",
    "page_id": "23",
    "text": "The FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING was formed as a brotherhood among members of\nthe various Free Peoples of Middle-earth. Its purpose was to take the\nOne Ring to Mordor that it might be cast into the fires of Mount Doom,\nthe mountain in which it was forged, so that it would be destroyed and\nultimately kill the Dark Lord Sauron.\n\nThe '''Fellowship '''was also known as the COMPANY OF THE RING, the NINE\nWALKERS, or more simply the COMPANY. Each of the members of the Company\nwere representatives of their respective races, with Legolas and Gimli\nbeing the only Elf and Dwarf chosen.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFormation\n\nFormed after the Council of Elrond, the Fellowship consisted of nine\nmembers: four Hobbits, two Men, one Elf, one Dwarf, and one Wizard. It\nis the only known organisation/group ever formed in the history of\nMiddle-earth, to hold members of each of these races within it (and with\nthe departure of the Elves and the Wizards from Middle-earth, there\nwould never be another like it), who largely lived and acted\nindependently of one another (or in the case of Elves and Dwarves, felt\nactive animosity toward each other). This number was chosen to match the\nnumber of Ring Wraiths, also known as Black Riders, the Nazgúl or the\nNine Riders. Merry and Pippin were never intended to be a part of the\nFellowship, with Elrond considering two Elf-lords from his own house. He\nwished to send the two younger hobbits back to the Shire as messengers\nto warn other Hobbits of the growing evil. However, the Halflings\npersevere: Merry is chosen and Gandalf convinces Elrond of the loyalty\nof Pippin.\n\n\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring was formed by Elrond after the Council of\nElrond. The Fellowship, being led mainly by Gandalf, headed down the\npath to Mordor.\n\nAfter a long and difficult journey south from Rivendell, and a\nnear-catastrophic attempt to cross over the Misty Mountains, the\nFellowship descended into Moria. In the former Dwarf-kingdom, they found\nevidence that Orcs had slain Gimli's kinsman Balin and other Dwarves who\nhad returned there. They were soon confronted by the Balrog known as\n_Durin's Bane_, who had many Orc and Troll minions under his control.\nGandalf fell facing this menace, and the Company was forced to go on\nwithout him.\n\nOnce they escaped Moria, the Fellowship headed to the Elven forest of\nLothlórien where they spoke with the Elven Lord Celeborn and Galadriel,\nLady of Light. Galadriel supplied them each with special Elven Gifts\nfrom Lothlórien, boats and supplies so that they could travel down the\nriver Anduin. This route was quicker than an overland march, but the\ngroup was attacked by Orc archers and shadowed by Gollum, who had begun\nfollowing them in Moria.\n\nForced to portage their boats around the waterfall called Rauros, the\nFellowship soon ran into difficulties. Boromir finally succumbed to\ntemptation, and attempted to seize the Ring from Frodo. This led to\nFrodo using the Ring to escape and he and Sam leaving to spare the\nothers the lure of it. The repentant Boromir died trying to defend Merry\nand Pippin against a large force of Uruks from Isengard.\n\nThe Fellowship was dissolved on the banks of the Anduin that day. Frodo\nand Sam carried on towards Mordor; Boromir was given funerary rites and\nsent floating over the falls, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli departed on\ntheir way to save Merry and Pippin.\n\nBreaking of the Fellowship\n\nAfter Boromir died the Fellowship split into three paths. From there\nAragorn, Legolas and Gimli chased after the Uruk-hai who took Merry and\nPippin. Their plan was to take the hobbits to Saruman in Isengard. Along\nthe way the trio crossed through the Gap of Rohan and came across Éomer\nwho led the banished Riders of Rohan across the land. After questioning\nÉomer, they found out that the riders had already slain the Uruk-hai\nthey were meant to track, the night before in a bloody massacre. So upon\narriving to site of battle, Aragorn discovers that the hobbits fled deep\ninto Fangorn Forest.\n\nGandalf, though thought to be dead when he fell at the Bridge of Khazad\nDum in Moria, came back to Middle-earth, reincarnated as Gandalf the\nWhite. He encountered Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in Fangorn, and they,\nmistaking Gandalf for Saruman, attempted to kill him. Gandalf assured\nthem that Merry and Pippin were safe (knowing they were in the hands of\nTreebeard). From there they rode out to Edoras, capital of Rohan. It was\nthere they saw King Theoden in ill-condition, poisoned by Saruman's\nservant Grima Wormtongue.\n\nFrodo and Sam continued their journey, getting closer to Mordor. Gollum\nhad tailed them. While attempting to take “the precious” in their sleep,\nFrodo and Sam awoke and captured him. Frodo realizing who he was decided\nGollum could be used as guide into Mordor.\n\nThe Second Fellowship\n\nIn the book, Aragorn continues to call the company he leads (Legolas and\nGimli, occasionally joined by Gandalf, Merry, and Pippin) the Fellowship\nof the Ring even after the original Fellowship breaks up following\nBoromir's death.

Some even used their bare hands,\nballing them up into fists to smash the allied armies, or sweeping them\nup and throwing them like rag-dolls.\n\nThe less fortunate of these trolls were also hideously amputated by the\norcs, giving them morning star (wrecking ball-like) arms in place of\ntheir flesh and blood ones, some had metal hooks placed into their backs\nfor goblins to take hold of, and the most unfortunate was blinded and\ngiven reigns dangling from their eye sockets for orcs to directly take\ncontrol of.\n\nThese trolls were probably Mountain Trolls from Gundabad in the northern\nmisty mountains, this would explain their height, and color of their\nskin (being a peach like hue) instead of the darker blue cave troll skin\nor dark grey olog-hai skin.\n\nUnlike the smaller Guldur Olog's these trolls couldn't simply be taken\ndown by a spear throw to the neck or a few arrows.

Their most noted leader was Elendil, Lord of\n    Andúnië, who later founded the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor in\n    Middle-earth.\n\nBy the close of the Second Age Númenóreans had become split between the\nElendili and the King's Men — a faction centered around the King that\nsought to assert Númenórean authority and self-determination.

    "text": "The FIRST AGE began with the completion of Valinor, and ended with the\noverthrow of Morgoth. The First Age was also known as the ELDER DAYS.\n\nIt lasted about 3,000 Valian years, and each Valian year is the\nequivalent of 10 solar years.(making it the longest of the three Ages\ndescribed by Tolkien), and ended with the final overthrow of Morgoth by\nthe combined armies of Valinor and Beleriand.\n\n\n\nTolkien describes primarily the events that occurred in Beleriand. These\nwere centered on a series of wars waged by the Sindar, the Ñoldor and\nthe Three Houses of the Edain, against the power of Morgoth. The wars\nhad actually begun during the Years of the Trees, but began again with\nrenewed fury after the arrival of the Ñoldor in Beleriand. There had\nbeen Elves in Beleriand for uncounted millennia, but they sought merely\nto exist, and Morgoth had little to do with them. The Ñoldor, on the\nother hand, particularly the Sons of Fëanor, had come with the express\npurpose of defeating Morgoth.\n\nChief Battles of this Age\n\n-   The Dagor-nuin-Giliath, so named because it was fought before the\n    rising of the Sun) was fought soon after the arrival of the Ñoldor.\n    Morgoth sent a raiding party from Angband to attack the Ñoldor\n    encampment in Hithlum, but the elves drove it back. Fëanor was\n    killed. It is considered the second battle in the Wars of Beleriand,\n    after one that took place during the Years of the Trees.\n\n\n\n-   The Dagor Aglareb was fought about seventy-five years after the\n    return of the Ñoldor. Morgoth again attacked the Ñoldor, and (again)\n    with no success. The Ñoldor became so bold as to besiege Angband.\n    However, the Siege was of limited effectiveness, because the\n    northern side of Angband on the north side of the Ered Engrin, and\n    was unapproachable to the Elven forces.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The Dagor Bragollach began when Morgoth poured rivers of fire out of\n    Angband, ruining the besieging Ñoldorin armies. The Ñoldor\n    eventually mustered a defense, but their losses were severe. For\n    instance, the green plain of Ard-galen had been permanently laid\n    waste by the rivers of fire, and was now called _Anfauglith_, the\n    Choking Dust; and the highlands of Dorthonion, which had been\n    inhabited by Edain, were made inhospitable.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The Nirnaeth Arnoediad was the first battle to be started by the\n    Ñoldor for the purpose of ending the power of Morgoth. They massed\n    an army composed of Elves, Edain, and the Easterling houses of Bór\n    and Ulfang allied to the Sons of Fëanor. The Elves and their allies\n    came very close to Angband, but Morgoth's trickery had upset their\n    battle plan, and Ulfang proved to be treacherous. The name\n    “Unnumbered Tears” comes from the fact that the Elves' last hope of\n    victory was destroyed. The land of Hithlum was lost, the Sons of\n    Fëanor were largely scattered, and the free peoples of Beleriand had\n    been decimated. The forces of Morgoth made a heap of the Elven and\n    Mannish dead in the center of Anfauglith.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The War of Wrath took place after Eärendil sailed to Valinor and\n    persuaded the Valar to help those whom they had forsaken. The Valar\n    gathered an army comprised of Maiar, Vanyar, and those Ñoldor who\n    had stayed in Valinor. The Teleri refused their aid, due to the\n    Kinslaying at Alqualondë, but consented to ferry the armies of the\n    Valar in their famous ships. This battle marked the first appearance\n    of the winged dragons, most notably Ancalagon the Black, but the\n    Valar had the day. Morgoth was captured, and cast out of Arda, but\n    his lands, as well as most of Beleriand, had been destroyed and sunk\n    under the sea in the heat of battle."

    "page_id": "200",
    "text": "ARNOR, also known as the NORTHERN KINGDOM, was a kingdom of men located\nin the land of Eriador in Middle-earth. The name probably means “Land of\nthe King”, from Sindarin ARA- (high, kingly) + (N)DOR (land).\n\n\nHistory\n\nArnor was founded in SA 3320 by Elendil and sons who went on to found\nthe southern realm of Gondor. The history of the two kingdoms is\nintertwined; both kingdoms are known as the Realms of the Dúnedain in\nExile.\n\nBefore the foundation of Arnor there was already a sizable Númenórean\npopulation living there, a result of the slow emigration of Númenóreans\nwhich had started under Tar-Meneldur and Tar-Aldarion. Before the\narrival of the Dúnedain, Arnor was home to Middle Men of Edain stock,\nand the early colonists soon interbred with the indigenous population.\nArnor was originally favoured over the more southern regions (Gondor)\nbecause the Elves under Gil-galad lived near it across the river Lhûn.\nHowever, in later days after the Númenóreans fell under Sauron's shadow\nthey settled more to the south. This led to a situation where Elendil\narrived in an area populated by people who, unlike his own Númenóreans,\nwere mainly still friends with the Elves, and unlike Gondor to the south\nin Arnor much knowledge of the Elder Days was preserved.\n\nArnor's second king Isildur (also King of Gondor) was killed in TA 2 by\norcs in the disastrous Battle of the Gladden Fields. His three eldest\nsons were killed with him, but the fourth and youngest, Valandil,\nsurvived and became king of Arnor (TA 2 or 10?).\n\n\n\nBecause Valandil and his heirs did not claim the throne of Gondor the\nrealms were split, but Arnor's ruler kept the title High King, whereas\nin the south the ruler was just _King._ At its height, Arnor borders\nextended from the Ice-Bay of Forochel in the north, the river Greyflood\ndown to Belegaer in the south, the river Hoarwell in the east, and the\nriver Lune in the west. The capital city was Annúminas, and the realm\nincluded other cities such as Fornost, Tharbad, Lond Daer, and Tyrn\nGorthad.\n\nDecline\n\nHuman folly and the plots of a deathless evil had undone this dream.\nArnor was no more; divided into the three kingdoms of Arthedain,\nCardolan and Rhudaur, the Dúnedain of the North spent their strength in\nfoolish, petty wars and while corruption and ambition sapped their\nstrength, enemies gathered on their frontiers. Arnor's capital was\nAnnúminas on Lake Evendim, but by TA 861 Fornost Erain had become the\ncapital instead as Annúminas became depopulated.\n\nAfter the death of its tenth king, Eärendur, in 861, Arnor was shaken by\ncivil war between the three sons of Eärendur. The eldest son, Amlaith,\nclaimed Kingship over all Arnor but was reduced to only ruling the\nregion of Arthedain as his kingdom, while the other sons founded the\nkingdoms of Cardolan and Rhudaur.\n\nArnor was refounded in name by Arthedain's king Argeleb I, when Cardolan\nplaced itself under the suzerainty of Arthedain. However, even Arthedain\nwas eventually destroyed. The people of Arnor were mostly wiped out by\nthe wars, but the Hobbits survived in the Shire, men survived in Bree\nand probably other villages, and the Dúnedain of Arnor created new homes\nin the Angle south of Rivendell, where some of them became known as the\nRangers of the North.\n\nReunited Kingdom\n\nAragorn II as King Elessar refounded the Kingdom of Arnor as part of the\nReunited Kingdom, and made Annúminas his summer capital. After the fall\nof Sauron, Arnor was safe again for human population, and although it\nremained less populated than Gondor to the south, in time Arnor became a\nmore densely populated area again, even when it had dwindled in size due\nto the independence of the Shire.",

    "text": "SINDARIN was the Elvish language most commonly spoken in Middle-earth\nduring in the Third Age - in the real world it is universally referred\nto as, when not in canonical context, “ELVEN” or “ELVISH”.\n\nThe written alphabet of Sindarin, as with Quenya, is typically Tengwar\n(the Feanorian Characters), although Cirth (Runes) can also be used.\n\n\nHistory\n\n It was the language of the Sindar,\nthose Teleri who chose to stay behind on the Great Journey of the Elves.\nIt was derived from an earlier language called “Common Telerin”. When\nthe Ñoldor came back to Middle-earth, they adopted the Sindarin\nlanguage, for the Sindar were more numerous and slower to learn the\nlanguage of Valinor, Quenya the Noldor's native language. Later events\nled to the banning of the use of Quenya within and around Beleriand\nleading to it's eventual use as a high language of law. Before the\ndownfall, most of the Men of Númenor also spoke the language. Knowledge\nof it was kept in the Númenorean realm in exile Gondor, especially among\nthe learned. Dwarves, notably Durin's Folk, used Sindarin when\ncommunicating with Elves. Sindarin is the language referred to as _the\nElven-tongue_ in _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\nTolkien originally imagined that the language which would become\n_Sindarin_ was spoken by the Ñoldor (second clan of Elves). However he\nlater decided that it was the language of the Sindar. For this reason it\nis called _Noldorin_ in the older material, such as the Etymologies.\nWhen Noldorin became Sindarin, it also adopted some features of the\noriginally unrelated language _Ilkorin_. Tolkien based the sound and\nsome of the grammar of his Noldorin/Sindarin on Welsh, and Sindarin\ndisplays of the consonant mutations that characterise the Celtic\n(especially Brythonic) languages. The language was also probably\ninfluenced to an extent by the Germanic languages, as Tolkien was a\nscholar of both Old English and Old Norse.\n\n\nGrammar\n\nSindarin is mainly analytic, though traits of its highly inflected\nprogenitor can still be seen.\n\nPhonology\n\nSindarin was designed to have a Welsh-like phonology. It has most of the\nsame sounds and similar phonotactics.\n\n  -------- ----- -------------------------------------------------------------\n  LETTER   IPA   NOTES\n  a              \n  b              \n  c              \n  ch             The “ch” in the German word “Buch”, not as in “church”\n  d              \n  dh             The “th” in “heather”\n  e              \n  f              Represents  when final or before n,  everywhere else.\n  g              \n  h              \n  hw             \n  i              Represents  when initial,  everywhere else.\n  l              \n  lh       ɬ     The same as the Welsh LL.\n  m              \n  n              \n  ng             Represents  when final,  everywhere else.\n  o              \n  p              \n  ph             Represents  when final,  everywhere else.\n  r              \n  rh             \n  s              \n  t              \n  th             The “th” in “heath”\n  u              \n  v              \n  w              \n  y              Pronounced like German _ü_\n  -------- ----- -------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn accent signifies a long vowel (á, é, etc.). In a monosyllabic word, a\ncircumflex is used (â, ê, etc.). However, for practical reasons, users\nof the ISO Latin-1 character set often substitute ý for ŷ.\n\nDiphthongs are _ai_ (pronounced like AIsle), _ei_ (dAY), _ui_ (tOO\nYoung), _au_ (cOW), and _oi_ (bOY). If the last diphthong finishes a\nword, it is spelt _aw_. There are also diphthongs _ae_ and _oe_ with no\nEnglish counterparts; Tolkien recommended to substitute _ai_ and _oi_\nrespectively if one does not care about details. If one does care, it is\nsimilar to pronouncing _a_ or _o_ respectively in the same syllable as\none pronounces an _e_ (as in pEt).\n\nIn archaic Sindarin, there was a vowel similar to German _ö_ (IPA: ),\nwhich Tolkien mostly transcribed as _œ_ (usually _not_ as _oe_ as is\noften found in publications like the Silmarillion, cf. _Nirnaeth\nArnoediad_ , _Goelydh_ ).\nThis vowel later came to be pronounced and is therefore transcribed as\nsuch .\n\nArchaic Sindarin also had a spirant _m_ or nasal _v_ (IPA: ), which was\ntranscribed as _mh_ (though always pronounced in later Sindarin).\n\nNouns\n\nPluralization\n\nSindarin plurals are characterised by _i-affection_, or _umlaut_. The\nSindarin term for this is _prestanneth_ (disturbance, affection). Almost\nall Sindarin words form their plurals like English man/men and\ngoose/geese — by changing the vowels in the word. The plural patterns\nare:\n\n-   In non-final syllables:\n    -   a > e — galadh > gelaidh\n    -   e > e — bereth > berith\n    -   i > i — dineth > dinith\n    -   o > e — gowest > gewist\n    -   u > y — tulus > tylys\n    -   y > y — (no example available)\n-   In final syllables:\n    -   a > ai — anar > enair\n    -   â > ai — tâl > tail\n    -   e > i — adaneth > edenith\n    -   ê > î — hên > hîn\n    -   i > i — brennil > brennil\n    -   î > î — dîs > dîs\n    -   o > y — brannon > brennyn\n    -   ó > ý — bór > býr\n    -   ô > ý — thôn > thýn\n    -   u > y — urug > yryg\n    -   û > ui — hû > hui\n    -   y > y — ylf > ylf\n    -   ý > ý — mýl > mýl\n    -   au > oe — naug > noeg\n\nNote that _ai_ can sometimes become _î_ (or, less commonly, _ý_).\n\nThe reason for this is that the primitive plural ending _-î_ (still\npresent in Quenya as _-i_) affected the vowels in the word by making\nthem higher and fronter. After this sound change occurred, the suffix\n_-î_ disappeared when all final vowels were lost.\n\nClass Plural\n\nSindarin also has several suffixes which denote a so-called class\nplural. For example, _-ath_ indicates a group of something, e. g.\n_elenath_ from elen (an archaic form of _êl_), meaning _star_ and\n_-ath_. It means _a group of stars_ or _all the stars in the sky_.\nAnother ending, _-rim_, is used to indicate a race, e. g. _nogothrim_\nfrom _nogoth_ — _dwarf_ and _-rim_, meaning _the race of dwarves_. The\nending _-hoth_ is generally used in an unfriendly sense, e. g.\n_gaurhoth_ from _gaur_ — _werewolf_ and _-hoth_, meaning\n_werewolf-host_.\n\nMutation\n\nSindarin has a complex series of mutations. There are three main\ndifferent types of mutations: _soft mutation_ (or lenition), _nasal\nmutation_ and _stop_ (occlusive) _mutation_. Additionally, a _mixed\nmutation_ is also observed after certain particles or prepositions.\nFinally, it is presumed that Sindarin also once had what we could call\nan _archaic spirantal mutation_ (also sometimes called _liquid mutation_\nby scholars). It is still uncertain whether this mutation is still\nproductive or if it only occurs in ancient constructs.\n\nInitial mutations must not be confused with assimilations that may occur\nin compound words (such as, for instance, in the names _Araphor_,\n_Arassuil_ and _Caradhras_).\n\nThe following table outlines how different consonants are affected by\nthe different mutations.\n\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n  BASIC   SOFT   NASAL   MIXED   STOP   LIQUID\n  b       v      m       b       b      v\n  c       g      ch      g       ch     ch\n  d       dh     n       d       d      dh\n  g       '      ng      g       g      '\n  h       ch     ch      h       ch     ch\n  lh      thl    'l      'l      thl    'l\n  m       v      m       m       m      v\n  p       b      ph      b       b      ph\n  rh      thr    'r      'r      thr    'r\n  s       s      s       h       s      s\n  t       d      th      d       th     th\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n\nHere the apostrophe indicates elision.\n\nWords beginning in _b-_, _d-_, or _g-_ which descend from older _mb-_,\n_nd-_, or _ng-_ are affected differently by the mutations:\n\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n  BASIC   SOFT   NASAL   MIXED   STOP   LIQUID\n  b       m      mb      mb      mb     b\n  d       n      nd      nd      nd     d\n  g       ng     g       g       g      g\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n\nTake, for example, the deictic article _i_, which triggers soft\nmutation. When added to a word like _tâl_, it becomes _i dâl_. In\nSindarin's phonological history, _t_ became _d_ in the middle of a word.\nBecause _i tâl_ at the time was considered one word, the _t_ became _d_,\nand thus _i dâl_. However, without the article the word is still _tâl_.\n\nMutation is triggered in various ways:\n\n-   Soft mutation, the most widely occurring mutation, is triggered by\n    the singular article _i_, the prefixes _athra-, ath-, go-, gwa-,\n    ú-,_ and _u-_, as well as the prepositions _ab, am, adel, be, dad,\n    di, na, nu,_ and _î_, and after _avo_. It also affects the second\n    element in a compound, an adjective following a noun, and the object\n    of a verb.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Nasal mutation is triggered by the plural article _in_, and the\n    prepositions _an, dan,_ and plural _'nin_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Mixed mutation is triggered by the genitive article _en_, and the\n    prepositions _ben, erin, nan, 'nin,_ and _uin_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Stop mutation is triggered by the prepositions _ed, ned,_ and\n    _o(d)_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Liquid mutation is presumably triggered by the preposition _or_.\n\nPronouns\n\nPronouns are perhaps the most poorly attested feature of Sindarin. What\nhas been reconstructed by the comparative method is largely conjectural\nand is not agreed upon, and therefore will not be addressed in this\narticle.\n\nSindarin pronouns, like those in English, still maintain some case\ndistinction. Sindarin pronouns have nominative, accusative, genitive,\nand dative forms.\n\n \n\nFirst Person\n\nSecond Person\n\nThird Person\n\n \n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nNominative\n\nim\n\nme\n\nle, ci\n\nle, ci\n\ne, te\n\nti\n\nAccusative\n\nnin\n\nmen\n\nlen, cin\n\nlen, cin\n\nten, den\n\ntin, hain\n\nGenitive\n\n \n\nmín\n\n \n\nlín\n\ndîn\n\n \n\nDative\n\nanim, enni\n\nammen\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEnclitic\n\n-n\n\n-m\n\n-ch\n\n \n\n—\n\n-r\n\nVerbs\n\nSindarin verbs are also quite complex. The number of attested verbs in\nSindarin is small, so the Sindarin verb system is imperfectly known; no\nverb has a full paradigm of forms available. There are two main types of\nverbs: _basic_ and _derived_. Basic verbs have stems which end in a\nconsonant, and derived verbs have stems which incorporate some sort\nderivational morpheme (such as a causative ending) which ends in _-a_.\n\nBasic Verbs\n\nBasic verbs, though smaller in number than derived verbs, have a very\ncomplex conjugation which arises from Sindarin's phonological history.\n\nBasic verbs form the infinitve by adding _-i_: _giri_ from _gir-_. This\nending causes an _a_ or _o_ in the stem to umlaut to _e_: _blebi_ from\n_blab-_. Sindarin does not use infinitive forms very often, and rather\nuses the gerund to achieve the same meaning.\n\nFor all persons except the third person singular, the present tense is\nformed by the insertion of _-i_, and the proper enclitic pronomial\nending: _girin_, _girim_, _girir_. As with the infinitive, _-i_ causes\nan _a_ or _o_ in the stem to umlaut to _e_: _pedin_, _pedim_, _pedir_,\nfrom _pad-_. The third person singular, because it has a zero-ending,\ndoes not require the insertion of _-i_. This leaves the bare stem,\nwhich, because of Sindarin's phonological history, causes the vowel of\nthe stem to become long: _gîr_, _blâb_, _pâd_.\n\nThe past tense of basic verbs is very complicated and poorly attested.\nOne common reconstructed system is to use _-n_: _darn_. However, the\nonly time this _-n_ actually remains is after a stem in _-r_. After a\nstem ending in _-l_, _-n_ becomes _-ll_: _toll_. After _-b, -d, -g, -v,_\nor _-dh_, it is metathesized and then assimilated to the same place of\narticulation as the consonant it now follows. The consonant then\nexperiences what could be called a “backwards mutation”: _-b, -d,_ and\n_-g_ become _-p, -b,_ and _-c_, and _-v_ and _-dh_ become _-m_ and _-d_.\nThe matter is complicated even further when pronomial endings are added.\nBecause _-mp, -mb, -nt, -nd,_ and _-nc_ did not survive medially, they\nbecome _-mm-, -mm-, -nn-, -nn-,_ and _-ng_. In addition, past tense\nstems in _-m_ would have _-mm-_ before any pronomial endings. Because\nthis all may seem rather overwhelming, look at these examples which show\nstep-by-step transformations:\n\n-   _cab-_ > **_cabn_ > **_canb_ > **_camb_ > _camp_, becoming _camm-_\n    with any pronomial endings.\n-   _ped-_ > **_pedn_ > **_pend_ > _pent_, becoming _penn-_ with any\n    pronomial endings.\n-   _dag-_ > **_dagn_ > **_dang_ (_n_ pronounced as in _men_) > **_dang_\n    (_n_ pronounced as in _sing_) > _danc_, becoming _dang-_ with any\n    pronomial endings.\n-   _lav-_ > **_lavn_ > **_lanv_ > **_lanm_ > **_lamm_ > _lam_, becoming\n    _lamm-_ before any pronomial endings.\n-   _redh-_ > **_redhn_ > **_rendh_ > **_rend_ > _rend_, becoming\n    _renn-_ before any pronomial endings.\n\nThe future tense is formed by the addition of _-tha_. An _-i_ is also\ninserted between the stem and _-tha_, which again causes _a_ and _o_ to\numlaut to _e_. Endings for all persons except for the first person\nsingular can be added without any further modification: _giritham_,\n_blebithar_. The first person singular ending _-n_ causes the _-a_ in\n_-tha_ to become _-o_: _girithon_, _blebithon_, _pedithon_.\n\nThe imperative is formed with the addition of _-o_ to the stem: _giro!_,\n_pado!_, _blabo!_.\n\nDerived Verbs\n\nDerived verbs have a much less complex conjugation because they have a\nthematic vowel (usually _a_) which reduces the number of consonant\ncombinations which occur.\n\nThe infinitive is formed with -o, which replaces the -a of the stem, e.\ng. _lacho_ from _lacha-_.\n\nThe present tense is formed without modification to the stem. Pronomial\nendings are added without any change.\n\nThe past tense is formed with the ending _-nt_, which becomes _-nne_\nwith any pronomial endings, e. g. _erthant_, _erthanner_.\n\nThe future tense is formed with _-tha_. With the addition of the first\nperson singular _-n_, this becomes _-tho_.\n\nThe imperative is formed like the infinitive.\n\n\nDialects\n\nDuring the First Age there were several dialects of Sindarin:\n\n-   _Doriathrin_ or the language of Doriath, a form of the language\n    which preserved many archaic forms;\n-   _Falathrin_ or the language of the Falas, later also spoken in\n    Nargothrond;\n-   _North Sindarin_, the dialects originally spoken in Dorthonion and\n    Hithlum by the Sindar, these dialects contained many unique words\n    and were not fully intelligible with the Sindarin of Beleriand\n    proper.\n\nWith the exception of Doriathrin, the dialects were changed under\nÑoldorin influence, and adopted many Quenya features, as well as unique\nsound changes devised by the Ñoldor (who loved changing languages). The\ndistinct dialects disappeared after the Ñoldor and Sindar were dispersed\nduring the later Battles of Beleriand. In the refuges on the Isle of\nBalar and the Mouths of Sirion a new dialect arose under the refugees,\nwhich mainly took after Falathrin. During the Second Age and Third Age\nSindarin was a lingua franca for all Elves and their friends, until it\nwas displaced as the Common tongue by Westron, a descendant of Adûnaic\nwhich was heavily influenced by Sindarin.\n\n_Sindarin_ is actually a Quenya term. The Sindarin word was perhaps\nEDHELLEN (“Elvish”).\n\n\nSample Phrases\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings_\n\n-   _Ai na vedui Dúnadan! Mae govannen!_ - Ah, at last, Westman!

It\nwas an age of peace, and was also known as the “Age of Men”.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Fourth Age began after Sauron was vanquished and the One Ring was\ndestroyed. The Shire and the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor were restored.\nIt marked the ascent of Men and the final diminishing of the Elves.\nGandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Bilbo and Frodo sailed for the Undying\nLands.\n\nThe allies of Sauron suffered a devastating blow that would take them\ncenturies to recover, if they did at all. Harad was defeated and\nconcluded a peace with King Aragorn II Elessar, by which Umbar, whose\nfleet had been completely destroyed in the mouths of the Anduin, was\nreturned to Gondor, and South Gondor also annexed. The Easterlings also\nsuffered a terrible defeat as their Orc allies fled in terror from the\nBattle of the Black Gate. However, King Elessar, his descendants and\nallies such as King Éomer still on occasion warred with their enemies\nover land, particularly over the bitterly contested region of the Sea of\nRhûn. King Elessar died in FO 120 and was succeeded by his son Eldarion\nwho ruled until about FO 220. Of the kings of the Reunited Kingdom after\nhim, nothing is known.\n\nTolkien said that he thought the distance between the end of the Third\nAge and the 20th century A.D. was about 6000 years, and that 1958 should\nhave been around the end of the Fifth Age if the Fourth and Fifth Ages\nwere about the same length as the Second and Third Ages. He said,\nhowever, in a letter written in 1958 that he believed the Ages had\nquickened and that it was about the end of the Sixth Age or beginning of\nthe Seventh (this letter is referred to in the “Fourth Age” article of\n_The Encyclopedia of Arda,_ as mentioned below)."

    "text": "VALINOR (Quenya; IPA: ; also\nVALINÓRË; ; meaning _Land of the Valar_), the Land_' across the Sea_',\nwas the realm of the Valar in Aman; the place to which they migrated\nafter being driven from Almaren by Melkor in times before the First Age.\nIt was also known as the Undying Lands as only immortal souls were\nallowed to reside there, with some exceptions when it came to the\nbearers of the One Ring; and additionally, even Gimli, who accompanied\nhis friend Legolas to these lands.\n\n\nLay of the land\n\nIts major city was Valmar, where the Vanyar and the Valar resided. Two\nother cities were Alqualondë and Tirion, the respective homes of the\nTeleri and the Noldor. It also had an island, Tol Eressëa, just off its\neast coast.\n\nValinor as explained was the home of the Valar, the Powers of\nMiddle-earth. The sea to the west of the island was called Ekkaia, or\nthe Encircling Sea; it surrounded both Valinor and Middle-earth.\n\nEach of the Valar had their own region of the land where they resided\nand altered things to their desire. Yavanna, the Vala of nature, growth,\nand harvest, resided in the Pastures of Yavanna in the south of the\nisland. Orome, the Vala of the hunt, lived in the Woods of Orome to the\nnorth-east of the pastures. The forest was home to many creatures which\nOrome could track and hunt. Nienna, the lonely Vala of sorrow and\nendurance lived cut off in the far west of the island in the Halls of\nNienna where she spent her days crying, looking out to sea. Just south\nof the Halls of Nienna and to the north of the pastures there were the\nHalls of Mandos. Mandos, the brother of Nienna, was the Vala of the\nafterlife. All inhabitants of Middle-earth went to the Halls of Mandos\nshould they happen to die, mortals and immortals alike (immortals could\nbe killed although they did not die of old age) although it was said\nthat in death as in life, they were separated. Also living in the Halls\nof Mandos was his spouse Vairë the weaver, who wove the threads of time.\n\nTo the east of the Halls of Mandos was the Isle of Estë, which was\nsituated in the middle of the lake of Lorellin which in turn was\nsituated to the north of the Gardens of Lórien (not to be confused with\nLothlórien in Middle-earth which was created by the same Valar, Lórien\nalso known as Irmo, the Vala of dreams). Este and Lórien being husband\nand wife lived close together. To the north of this were the Mansions of\nAule the smith Valar who was spouse to Yavanna. In the north-east lay\nthe Mansions of Manwe and Varda, the two most powerful Valar, also\nmarried. To the west of them stood the Trees of Valinor, Telperion and\nLaurelin. The entire great island of Valinor was surrounded on three\nsides (excluding the north which was instead protected by ices flows) by\na huge mountain range called the Pelóri mountains. In the extreme\nnorth-east, past the mountain range was the pass of Helcaraxë, a vast\nand treacherous ice sheet which in the beginning, before the fall of\nNúmenor, joined the two continents of Valinor and Middle-earth. In the\nbeginning, the Noldor, tricked by the evil Vala Melkor passed along this\npass to go back to Middle-earth, among those was Galadriel who was\nfeatured in the War of the Ring. Those who took this pass were not\nallowed back to Valinor for many years, but in the end pity was taken on\nthem when Middle-earth began to fade and pass into the age of men and\nthey were allowed to pass back to the Undying Lands of their own accord\nwhen they felt ready to do so.\n\nAlso, for a time after the exile of the Noldor and before the ruin of\nNúmenor, a long chain of small islands called the Enchanted Isles ran\nthe full length of the east coast to the continent. The enchanted\nislands and a bewildering shadow created the Shadowy Seas, which to\nprevent mariner, mortal or immortal, from reaching the land by sea (by\nthe Belegaer, the Great Sea which separated Middle-earth and Valinor.\nUntil the Changing of the World in the center of this sea was the isle\nof Númenor. This defence lasted centuries until Eärendil was guided\nthrough the Shadowy Seas by the light of the Silmaril brought on board\nby his wife Elwing. They sailed on Vingilot, said to be the fairest ship\never fashioned, constructed by Earendil and Cirdan the shipwright.\n\nAfter the destruction of Númenor and the Changing of the World, the\nUndying Lands were no longer a physical part of Arda so that Men could\nno longer sail to Aman or Tol Eressea. Only the Elves could sail there\nby the Straight Road and in ships capable of passing out of the Spheres\nof the earth.\n\nBy special permission of the Valar, the Hobbits Frodo Baggins, Bilbo\nBaggins, and Samwise Gamgee were also permitted to go to Valinor, and\nLegolas the elf brought with him Gimli the Dwarf.\n"

    "text": "ERIADOR was a large region situated in northwestern Middle-earth. It was\nlocated between the Blue Mountains (to the west) and the Misty Mountains\n(to the east).\n\n\nDescription and Climate\n\nAccording to _The Atlas of Middle-earth_, Eriador was about six-hundred\nmiles (approximately 965.5 kilometers) from east to west. It was\nmostly lowlands. Hill areas were mainly in around the realms of Arnor,\nthe Shire in the center of the region and in the far eastern parts near\nthe Misty Mountains. Plains and bottomlands were in the south and\nsouthwestern parts. A plateau area existed in the area where Rivendell\nand the Trollshaws were located. Eriador was largely made up of\nscattered woodlands with scrublands in the north and northeastern parts.\nThe rest were short grasslands mainly in the center of the region.\n\nThe climate was mainly humid with relatively mild to cold winters with a\nconstantly warm and moist prevailing wind blowing over the Blue\nMountains. In the northern part, cold and dry prevailing winds blow down\nfrom the polar north influencing the climate as well.\n\nMost of the population was concentrated in the center area around Arnor\nand the Shire and the dominant language was Westron at least by the\nThird Age.\n\nIts boundaries were:\n\n-   To the east, the Misty Mountains.\n-   To the north, the Ice-Bay of Forochel, which flooded part of the\n    lands of Morgoth after the War of Wrath.\n-   To the west, the Blue Mountains.\n-   To the south, the river Greyflood and the land of Enedwaith. After\n    the War of Wrath, part of the southwestern border lies along the\n    shores of Belegaer.\n\nImportant rivers were the Lune (Elvish _Lhûn_), the Brandywine or\n_Baranduin_ in Elvish and the Greyflood.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the Second Age, and possibly much earlier, it was largely forested,\nbut Men cleared the land for farming and the massive old forests never\nrecovered. Much of it was encompassed in the early Third Age by the\nkingdom of Arnor, which later split into the rival kingdoms of Rhudaur,\nArthedain and Cardolan. The Shire occupies part of the former Kingdom of\nArthedain, while Bree and its neighbouring villages lie on the border\nwith the former Cardolan. The Barrow-wights dwell within ancient burial\nmounds constructed in the First Age by the Edain as they journeyed to\nBeleriand. Other important places in Eriador are Rivendell and the\nabandoned kingdoms of Eregion and Angmar.\n\nAt the beginning of the Second Age, large populations of both regular\nMen and Dúnedain inhabited the region. There was also a group of\nNoldorin exiles living in Eregion, near Moria and also located in the\nwestern most region of Eriador (and also in Middle-earth) was the High\nElven Kingdom of Lindon, once the greatest and mightiest kingdom of\nMiddle earth. Sauron's assault on the Elves of Eregion laid waste to\nthat land, and many of the Elves of the Lindon fell in the War of the\nLast Alliance.\n\nEven after his fall, Sauron's evil spirit acted through his agents, such\nas the Witch-king of Angmar, and he also concocted virulent plagues\nwhich swept over the land. Between warfare against the surviving\nDúnedain kingdoms, the plagues, and the general lawlessness sweeping\nover the land, the population dropped considerably. The Angmar War\nturned Eriador into a beautiful, but mostly wild and untamed land, and\nthe only concentration of Elves was either in the valley of Rivendell or\nLindon.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ERIADOR_ is a Sindarin word that meant 'Lonely land' or\n'Lone-lands'.",

    "text": "The WAR OF THE RING was fought between Sauron and the free people of\nMiddle-earth for control of the One Ring and dominion over the\ncontinent. It took place at the end of the Third Age. Together with the\nQuest of Mount Doom, it is one of the overarching plot-lines of _The\nLord of the Rings_.\n\nThe war was initiated by Sauron, who had gained strength since the end\nof the Second Age and sought the One Ring. During the War of the Ring,\nmany thousands of Men of Rohan and Men of Gondor were killed. The\noverall number of combatants in the war is estimated to be over one\nmillion—tens of thousands from the side of the Free Peoples and hundreds\nof thousands from the Evil side. The war also signified the decline of\nthe Elves' power in Middle-earth, the rise of Men in the West, the\nrestoration of the King of Gondor and Arnor and the start of the Fourth\nAge.\n\nBattles were fought in Gondor, Rohan, Lórien, Mirkwood, at the Lonely\nMountain and at Dale. These were primarily waged against Sauron's\nforces, but Saruman, a third contender, also had armies, who fought\nbattles at the Fords of Isen and Helm's Deep.\n\nThe first full-scale battle fought in the war was the first Battle of\nthe Fords of Isen, and the war ended after the Battle of Bywater and,\nshortly afterwards, the deaths of Saruman and Gríma Wormtongue. Towards\nthe end of the War of the Ring, Elessar was crowned King of Gondor, and\nforgave the Men who had fought under Sauron, heralding a great renewal\nof cooperation and communication between Men, Elves, and Dwarves.\n\n\nOrigins of the War\n\nAccording to Mithrandir, the War of the Ring had begun at the\ntime Thorin Oakenshield met Bilbo Baggins in The Shire. Gandalf's\nreasoning is explained in the book _Unfinished Tales_. This is an\nexcerpt from a narrative of Gandalf to Frodo set in a house in Minas\nTirith. “_You may think that Rivendell was out of his reach, but I did\nnot think so. The state of things in the North was very bad. The Kingdom\nUnder the Mountain and the Strong Men of Dale were no more. To resist\nany force that Sauron might send North to regain Angmar were only the\nDwarves of the Iron Hills, and behind them lay desolation and a Dragon.\nThe Dragon Sauron might use with terrible effect._” That is why Gandalf\nthought that he had to get rid of Smaug, and he chanced upon Thorin and\nBilbo at different times, and saw the way to do it, which is told in\n_The Hobbit_.\n\nGandalf's role\n\nGandalf was to the Free Peoples of Middle-earth as a field marshal is to\nhis army fighting on the field—a master strategist and tactician. As\nseen in the opening stages of _The Fellowship of the Ring_ book and\nmovie, Gandalf the Grey would spend many hours, searching, scavenging,\nand sifting out archaic maps and accounts in long-hidden archives strewn\nabout Middle-earth. He would often carefully examine them, figuring out\nthe best way to defeat the Enemy and marshal as many allies as possible\nto his cause.\n\nGandalf likely spent much thought in strategy, before implementing his\nplans to maximum effect. He had been roaming Middle-earth for many years\nduring the Third Age, before Sauron's power was at its apex. He might\nhave had a 'hit list' of targets to neutralize that Sauron might use in\nthe next war upon the Free Peoples. One of these targets was Smaug, as\nseen in _The Hobbit._\n\nGandalf's adaptability and aptitude for strategy proved invaluable to\nhis allies during the complicated web that was to prove to become the\nWar of the Ring. As told in _Unfinished Tales_, Gandalf had known for\nquite a while that Sauron's use of Smaug would virtually guarantee\nvictory over his enemies, namely those of Gondor. He and his Dwarf\ncompanions thus set out to destroy Smaug, and bring the victory of the\nWar of the Ring one step closer for the Free Peoples.\n\nThe Roles of the other Istari\n\nSaruman became the secondary enemy in the War of the Ring, originally\nhaving served the Free Peoples and eventually succumbing to the power of\nthe One Ring.\n\nThe two Blue Wizards, Alatar and Pallando, also served an important role\nin the outcome of the war. Although they weren't directly mentioned in\nthe _Lord of the Rings_, they were enemies of Sauron, and might have\nused the Dark Elves and the Dwarves of the Red Mountains to weaken the\nEasterlings.\n\n\nEvents\n\nSouthern Theatre\n\nThe objective of Sauron's grand strategy was to defeat the strongest of\nthe nations that opposed him, Gondor, and to do so he would need to take\nthe capital city and greatest fortress of Gondor, Minas Tirith. To this\nend, the war effort of Mordor was focused in the south in and around\nGondor, in a strategy of divide and conquer. To keep Gondor's ally\nRohan, on its northern border, from sending aid, Sauron promoted the\nrise of Saruman at Isengard to the west of Rohan. Thus all of Rohan's\nforces would be focused in the west trying to stem the tide of the\nIsengard attack, and none would be sent to Minas Tirith's defence.\nMeanwhile, Sauron sent the Mordor-allied Corsairs of Umbar to attack\nGondor's populous southern coastal fiefs, which as a result sent only a\nfraction of their forces to defend Minas Tirith in northern Gondor,\nwhile the rest stayed on the coasts preparing for the Corsair assault.\nHowever, Sauron's divide and conquer strategy was ultimately foiled and\na united front of Gondor and Rohan's forces faced Mordor.\n\nRohan\n\nThe War of the Ring started in Rohan when Saruman's troops crossed the\nFords of Isen. Théodred, the son of the King Théoden, had mustered his\nforces on the fords in order to launch a surprise attack against the\nenemy. On February 23, 3019 he attacked the vanguard of the Orcs\nmarching out of Isengard. Reinforcements were quickly sent from Isengard\nhowever, and Théodred ordered a retreat. His forces retreated to an\nisland in the fords, but they were soon surrounded and he was killed.\nGrimbold managed to hold the island, but would not have succeeded if\nElfhelm had not come with reinforcements from Helm's Deep. Thus the\nfirst battle of the Fords of Isen ended in victory for the Rohirrim.\n\nNow that the Marshal of the Westmark was dead, Erkenbrand took command\nof the Westfold. He placed Grimbold and Elfhelm at the Fords. However,\nthey were unable to withstand the force of Isengard, and were\nsurrounded. Though they successfully broke through the enemy's lines,\nthey ended up scattered around the Westfold, giving Saruman clear\npassage into Rohan.\n\nMeanwhile, Gandalf drove Gríma Wormtongue out of Edoras and went to\ngather Erkenbrand's scattered forces, advising King Théoden to move to\nthe stronghold of Helm's Deep. The king and his forces arrived\nunmolested, but soon the fortress was surrounded by Saruman's troops.\nAll through the night of March 3rd-4th a combined force of Orcs and Wild\nMen from Dunland besieged Helm's Deep, and despite the efforts of the\nRohirrim (aided by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli) hope appeared lost.\nBelieving Rohan was lost, Théoden decided to mount a final, suicidal\ncharge against Saruman's forces. Unexpectedly, however, Gandalf arrived\nin the nick of time with Erkenbrand and the scattered Rohirrim, along\nwith a forest of Huorns who had been sent to the battle by Treebeard.\nThe Orcs were trapped and utterly annihilated. The wild Men were taken\ncaptive, however, were freed after swearing an oath of loyalty to Rohan\nand clearing the battlefield of the dead. (The mercy of this act amazed\nthe captives, who had been told by Saruman that the men of Rohan were\ncruel and burned their captives alive.)\n\nDays before, at an Entmoot in Fangorn Forest, the Ents, furious over the\ndestruction Saruman had wrought upon the forest, decided to march on\nIsengard. They were to move up to Isengard and destroy it. By 3 March\nthe destruction was completed, and the command of Isengard was taken by\nthe Ent Treebeard. At Gandalf's request he sent a large herd of Huorns\nto the Battle of Hornburg, to aid the Rohirrim.\n\nGondor\n\nFor over 3000 years, the realm of Gondor had held back the threat from\nthe East. In time, the kingdom declined, and Sauron prepared to swoop in\nfor the kill. Faramir, captain of Gondor, had divided his forces to too\nmany fronts. The two most important of these were in the island citadel\nof Cair Andros and the ruined city of Osgiliath. In a strict sense, the\nWar of the Ring began with the Great Signal from Minas Morgul and the\nanswering signal from Mount Doom, and thus the attack on Osgiliath was\nthe first battle of the war proper. Sauron's two armies obliterated the\nfortresses, and Faramir was forced to retreat to the causeway forts, the\nlast defence against the Morgul forces. Soon these too were destroyed,\nand only Minas Tirith remained.\n\nThe attack soon began, as the Nazgûl hovered above and spread terror and\nconfusion, and siege towers tried to take the walls but were all\ndestroyed. After several repulsed attacks, the Gate of Minas Tirith was\nbroken, and the Lord of the Nazgûl entered. He was the first and only\nenemy to do so. All seemed lost — until six thousand Rohirrim, under\nKing Théoden's command, came and somewhat relieved Gondor's defenders.\nStill, the battle was in doubt until Aragorn arrived with a large force\nout of South Gondor. The joint force of Gondor and Rohan then\nsuccessfully defeated their enemies after an exhausting day of fighting.\nThis battle resulted in the deaths of the Witch-king of Angmar, King\nTheoden, and Denethor, Steward of Gondor.\n\nThe Battle of the Morannon was the final major battle against Sauron in\nthe War of the Ring, fought at the Black Gate of Mordor. The Army of the\nWest, roughly 6,000 strong, led by Aragorn marched on the gate and faced\na vastly larger force as a diversionary feint to distract Sauron's\nattention from Frodo and Sam, who were carrying the One Ring through\nMordor. It was hoped that Sauron would think Aragorn had the Ring and\nwas now trying to use it to overthrow Mordor. Despite the seemingly\nimpossible odds the Army of the West was eventually victorious, for when\nthe Ring was destroyed, Sauron's forces fled or surrendered in dismay.\n\nNorthern Theatre\n\nMordor's war effort was focused in the south against Gondor, but using\nhis outstretched right arm Sauron attempted to flank the lands of the\nFree Peoples through Rhovanion, using orcs and allied barbarian nations\nof Men. In this theatre of the war (which had spread far across\nMiddle-earth) Sauron's primary objective was to use the forces at his\nprimary base of operations in the area, Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood,\nto defeat Lothlórien, then pass the Misty Mountains (attacking\nRivendell), and wheel around to take Rohan and Gondor from the rear.\nHowever, Dol Guldur had to deal with the threat of the Woodland Realm of\nThranduil, and thus split their forces between the attack on Lothlórien\nand the one on the Woodland Realm. Sauron wanted to use his barbarian\nEasterling allies in a joint attack with the Orcs from Dol Guldur on the\nWoodland Realm, and then have this victorious army link up with the\nother ones attacking Lothlórien and defeat it. However, unfortunately\nfor Sauron a strong and extremely powerful Dwarf nation now existed at\nthe Lonely Mountain thanks to the efforts of Gandalf, as well as the\nDwarves of the Iron Hills and allied Men of Dale. Mordor's Easterling\nallies were tied up fighting the Dwarves of Erebor and Men of Dale,and\nnever linked up with the Mordor forces assaulting the Woodland Realm,\nwhich in turn could not link up with those attacking Lothlórien, and the\nline held.\n\nBridging the gap between the northern and southern theatres of the war\nwas the line of the River Anduin between Lothlórien and Gondor, running\nalong the Rohan border. Orc armies peeling off from the assault on\nLothlórien tried to enter Rohan via this route, while almost its entire\narmy had left to fight at Minas Tirith, but the Ents of Fangorn forest\ncounterattacked and drove the orcs back in a panic, and most if not all\ndrowned while attempting to flee by crossing the river.\n\nDale and the Lonely Mountain\n\nWhen the war began, the Dwarves of Erebor\nrefused to cooperate with Sauron in his hunt for the Ring. And so Sauron\nsent an army of Easterlings to Dale. On March 17 they met the armies of\nthe Dwarves of Erebor (and of the Iron Hills as well) and the Men of\nDale. After three days of fighting, Men and Dwarves were overrun, Dale\nwas sacked and razed to ash (the second, possibly third, time in a\ncentury) and sought refuge in Erebor. The defenses of the Lonely\nMountain were prepared for the battle that would decide the fate of\nnorthern Middle-earth, and possibly even the War of the Ring itself.\n\nThe Easterlings hurled their full force at the allied armies, exploiting\ntheir dreaded heavy infantry force to punch a hole in the Dwarvish and\nMannish lines. A furious melee ensued, evolving into a tempest of fire,\ndead and dying men, and the flash of steel. Both sides took horrendous\nlosses, the Easterlings from the arrows, spears, and rocks cast from the\nLonely Mountain's cliffs, and the Men and Dwarves from the scimitars and\nmaces of the Easterlings. Finally, King Brand of Dale fell before the\ngate of the Lonely Mountain, and King under the Mountain Dáin II\nIronfoot fell as he was defending Brand's body.\n\nThe Dwarves of Erebor had learnt a crucial lesson from the devastation\nof Smaug and the Battle of the Five Armies nearly a century earlier, a\nlesson bought with the blood of loved ones. They fortified all of the\nsides of the Lonely Mountain, preventing the breakthrough of orcs that\nnearly caused the loss of the Battle in the days of Bilbo Baggins and\nThorin Oakenshield. The defenders knew with grim fatalism that there\nwould be no Beorn and no Eagles to save them this time, and they were\nthus determined to fight to the last. The Lonely Mountain was staged to\nbecome the Minas Tirith of the North, a ruthless battle of the will of\nthe defender and the will of the aggressor.\n\nThe invaders from the east constructed siege works, battering rams, and\nassorted siege catapults to bombard their enemies into submission.\nHowever, despite all of their efforts, the great gates of the Lonely\nMountain withstood the tidal wave of invaders from the East. Many Men\nand Dwarves made their escape to Erebor however and were able to\nwithstand the siege of the mountain fastness. When news spread about the\nvictory in the South, the Easterlings became extremely demoralized and\nproceeded to scatter, while the sons of Brand and Dáin let their army\nout of Erebor to break the encirclement.\n\nLothlórien and Mirkwood\n\nOn March 11, Lothlórien was first attacked from Dol Guldur. It was\nattacked two further times, on the 15 and the 22. When the Dark Lord had\nfallen, Celeborn led his army out of Lóerin, and crossed the Anduin. Dol\nGuldur was captured and destroyed by Galadriel.\n\nThranduil of Mirkwood was also attacked from Dol Guldur on March 15\nresulting in the long Battle Under the Trees, in which Thranduil's\nkinfolk won a hard victory. After the destruction of Dol Guldur,\nCeleborn met Thranduil on April 6, and as the shadow had passed, they\ndivided Mirkwood and renamed it Eryn Lasgalen.\n\nThe Shire\n\nAfter the defeat of the Dark Lord, Saruman used the magic of his voice\nto convince Treebeard to release him from Isengard. He travellled to the\nShire, where he replaced Lotho Sackville-Baggins as the Chief under the\nname _Sharkey_. Under his command Ruffian men entered The Shire and\nruined it. They were defeated by Hobbits under the lead of Meriadoc\nBrandybuck and Peregrin Took in the Battle of Bywater on the 3rd of\nNovember. The Hobbits headed to Hobbiton where Frodo ordered Saruman and\nWormtongue to leave the Shire. Wormtongue, however, killed Saruman,\nbefore he himself was killed by the Hobbits and their arrows. With the\ndeath of the wizard Saruman, the War of the Ring finally ended, as did\nthen the Third Age.\n\n\nConsequences and Legacy\n\nThe War of the Ring had great influence on all of the lands of the\nnorthwest of Middle-earth. Most importantly it led to the restoration of\nthe Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor as the Reunited Kingdom, under King\nElessar Telcontar. The Steward of Gondor was dead, but he was succeeded\nby his son Faramir, who kept the office and was given the title _Prince\nof Ithilien_.\n\nIn Rohan the heir apparent, Théodred, was killed, and, during the Battle\nof Pelennor Fields, King Théoden died as well. He was succeeded by his\nnephew Éomer. In the Glittering Caves at the Hornburg, a Dwarven colony\nwas established, and Isengard was given to the Ents, who filled\nSaruman's pits and reforested the land, renaming it The Treegarth of\nOrthanc\n\nIn Dale, both King Brand and King Dáin II Ironfoot were killed, who were\nsucceeded by their sons Bard and Thorin III Stonehelm. They sent their\nemissaries to the crowning of Elessar, and were in alliance with Gondor\nuntil their Kingdoms ended.\n\nFor the Elves, the final decline had begun. With the destruction of the\nOne Ring, the power of the Three Rings faded, and the kingdoms that had\nbeen preserved by their magic began to fade with them. The bearers of\nthe Rings left Middle-earth, and Lórien was eventually abandoned. The\nElves of Lothlórien who did not depart over the Sea moved east to the\nsouthern third of Mirkwood, below the Narrows, which they named East\nLórien. In Eryn Lasgalen however, Thranduil's rule continued, and they\nhad peace. There was also an Elven colony in Ithilien. Many of the Elves\nof Rivendell departed over the Sea, and by Aragorn's death 120 years\nlater, it was entirely deserted.\n\nIn the Shire life continued as it had prior to the war. It was declared\na free land under the Sceptre of Annúminas, and Men were forbidden to\nenter it. The Westmarch was added to the Shire by King Elessar in SR\n1452.\n\nThe different races of Men that had served Sauron suffered grievously at\nthe hands of what appeared to be booty and loot just begging them to\ncome; much of Harad's army was annihilated on the Pelennor Fields,\nslaughtered by the swords of Gondor and the lances of Rohan. The mighty\nEasterlings hastily retreated back to their homelands after Sauron's\nfall and fought several territorial wars with King Elessar over lands\nnear the Sea of Rhûn, but ceased to be a threat altogether. While they\nwere still a menace, much like a sleeping viper, they never troubled the\nReunited Kingdom again.\n\nOnce the Fourth Age began, the elves stopped having an active influence\non the affairs of Middle-earth, having started fading away ever since\nthe Third Age. Orcs never became a serious threat again, reduced to\nsmall bands of mountain brigands they were never more than a nuisance.\nAll the Nazgûl were killed, with Sauron reduced to a mere shadow of\nmalice. Wars would still be fought by the Reunited Kingdom and Rohan\nagainst the Men that had allied with Sauron, the Haradrim and\nEasterlings."

    "page_id": "163",
    "text": "GONDOR was the prominent kingdom of Men in Middle-earth, bordered by\nRohan to the north, Harad to the south, the cape of Andrast and the Sea\nto the west, and Mordor to the east. Its first capital was Osgiliath,\nmoved to Minas Tirith in TA 1640. The city of Minas Tirith remained the\ncapital of Gondor for the rest of the Third Age and into years of the\nFourth Age; other major fortresses include Dol Amroth in Belfalas and\nOsgiliath, which was a city on the Anduin.\n\nGondor was founded by the brothers Isildur and Anárion, exiles from\nNúmenor. Gondor was an allied kingdom with Arnor, whose line of king\nchieftains came from Isildur, while the Line of the Kings of Gondor was\nfrom Anárion. Gondor was at the height of its power in its early years\ndue to the ships and the military might that its armies possessed.\nHowever, continued attacks by allies of Sauron, civil war, and a\ndevastating plague caused it to gradually decline over the course of the\nThird Age until Sauron's final defeat and the crowning of Aragorn II\nElessar. Following that time the power of Gondor once again expanded,\nuntil the former lands of Arnor were brought under the banner of the\nReunited Kingdom. \n\nIn all, there were thirty-one kings of Gondor after Anárion, who was\nslain before Barad-dûr at the Siege of Barad-dûr. \n\n\nHistory\n\nLike Arnor to the north, Gondor was a Mannish kingdom founded by\nAnárion, the youngest son of Elendil, after the Downfall of Númenor. It\nwas located to the South of Rohan and to the West of Mordor, on the Bay\nof Belfalas.\n\nEarly years\n\n Before the Downfall of Númenor,\nGondor was home to many Númenórean colonists, who either mixed blood\nwith the indigenous Middle Men if they were friendly, or dispersed them\ninto Ras Morthil, Dunland, and Drúadan Forest. Gondor, at a latitude\ncomparable to Venice, was a more fertile region than Arnor to the north,\nand therefore it already had a larger population before the ships of\nElendil's sons arrived, including a well-established city, Pelargir.\n\nThe Faithful or Elendili from Númenor were given a warm reception upon\ntheir arrival by those that had already colonized Middle-earth,\nincluding a colonial branch of Númenorean royalty at Dor-en-Ernil. The\ncolonists north of Anduin accepted Elendil's claim to kingship over\nthem. South of the Great River, however, the newly exiled Númenoreans\ndid not recognize Elendil's claim.\n\nGondor was being founded after Númenor's population had already split\nbetween The Faithful and King's Men, and all of the more southern\ncolonies (such as Umbar) remained enemies of The Faithful.\n\nThe newly founded kingdom of Gondor was then part of the Last Alliance\nof Elves and Men which overthrew Sauron for the first time at the very\nend of the Second Age, and when Isildur cut the finger of Sauron.\n\nGondor Prospers\n\nAfter the war, Gondor's power and wealth grew steadily (only interrupted\nby an Easterling invasion in TA 492). Its power would continue to grow\ninto the 9th century Third Age. While the power of Gondor's sister\nkingdom Arnor peaked during the 9th century, when it broke into various\nsuccessor states, Gondor's greatest glory was yet to come. Gondor's\ngreat cities Minas Anor, Minas Ithil, Osgiliath and Pelargir only grew\nand the Dunedain of Gondor started to rule over more and more of the\nlesser people.\n\nGondor's Golden Age\n\n\n\nGondor's power reached its Golden Age under the four “Ship-kings”:\n\n-   Tarannon Falastur r. TA 830 – TA 913. First of the Ship-Kings, died\n    childless\n-   Eärnil I r. TA 913 – TA 936. Nephew of Tarannon\n-   Ciryandil r. TA 936 – TA 1015\n-   Hyarmendacil I (Ciryaher) r. TA 1015 - TA 1149. Last of the\n    Ship-Kings. In the reign of the powerful king, Hyarmendacil I (c.\n    12th century TA) Gondor reached the height of its power. During\n    Hyarmendacil's reign, Gondor's borders reached their furthest\n    extent. The Kingdom extended east to the Sea of Rhûn, south to the\n    nearest lands of the Haradrim, as far north as Mirkwood, and west\n    towards the borders of Arnor.\n\nSuch was Gondor's wealth during the period that men from other lands\nwould say in envy: “In Gondor precious stones are but pebbles for the\nchildren to play with.” Gondor would also enjoy several centuries of\npeace due to its military might.\n\n\n\nThe Decline of Gondor\n\nHowever, after decadence spread under the Kings of Gondor and a long\nperiod of decline began (although Gondor experienced several revivals).\nThree great calamities struck Gondor during the second millennium of the\nThird Age, which are held to be the chief reasons for its decline: the\nKin-strife, the Great Plague, and the invasion of the Wainriders (a\ntribe of Easterlings).\n\nThe Kin-strife\n\nIn the 15th century TA a great civil war named the Kin-strife tore the\nnation apart. The current King Eldacar was of mixed blood: his mother\nwas of the Northmen. Popular displeasure at this led to the overthrow of\nKing Eldacar by Castamir, the admiral of all of Gondor's naval forces\nwho possessed some royal blood. Eldacar's son was slain, and he fled\nnorth. Castamir was afterwards known as Castamir the Usurper. During his\nten-year rule, he proved to be very cruel, and because of his love of\nhis old fleet, he lavished attention on the coastal regions while the\ninterior provinces were ignored and left to rot. Eldacar then returned\nwith an army of his Northman kinsmen, and the armies of the Men of\nGondor joined them from interior provinces such as Anórien. Osgiliath\nwas devastated during this conflict, its great bridge destroyed and its\n_Palantír_ lost. Eldacar slew Castamir and reclaimed his throne, but\nCastamir's sons and their forces were besieged in Pelargir, the great\nport of Gondor. They eventually retreated to Umbar, where they joined\nwith the Corsairs, and troubled Gondor for many years, until their\ndescendants died out.\n\nThe Great Plague\n\nLater, the Great Plague struck and the White Tree died. This Plague was\nno localized event: the Plague swept through all of Middle-earth,\nreaching the successor states of Arnor and the Hobbits of the Shire in\nthe North. King Tarondor found a sapling of the White Tree, and moved\nthe capital from Osgiliath to Minas Anor, the City of Anárion. During\nthis time, Gondor was so depopulated that the fortifications guarding\nagainst the re-entry of evil into Mordor were abandoned. It is believed\nthat had the Haradrim or Easterlings been capable of attacking Gondor at\nthis time, it would have fallen. However, the Plague left Gondor's\nenemies in no better condition than Gondor itself, and neither side was\ncapable of mounting new offensives.\n\nThe Invasion of the Wainriders\n\nFollowing the sapping of Gondor's strength by the plague, it did recover\nbut then the Wainrider (Easterlings) invaded and devastated Gondor, and\nthe conflict lasted for almost a century. The Wainriders destroyed the\nNorthern Army of Gondor, but survivors linked up with the victorious\nSouthern Army of Gondor which destroyed the Haradrim as they crossed the\nriver Poros, led by a general named Eärnil, and they destroyed the\nWainriders as they celebrated their victory during the Battle of the\nCamp.\n\nThe Line of the Kings Fails\n\nReunification Rejected\n\nIn TA 1944 Gondor faced a succession crisis when King Ondoher was slain\nin battle with both his sons. Arvedui, Prince of Arthedain, Ondoher's\nson-in-law, and the victorious general Eärnil, who was a distant\nblood-relative of Ondoher, claimed the throne. Arvedui's claim lay\nmainly in the reintroduction of the old Nùmenorean law of accession,\nwhich stated the eldest (remaining) child should succeed the king. If\nthe law was reintroduced, then Arvedui's wife Fíriel, Ondoher's daughter\nand last remaining child, would become Ruling-Queen, making their\ndescendants Kings of both Arnor and Gondor. Arvedui also tried to put\nweight behind his claim, as he was Isildur's heir. The council of Gondor\nrecognised that the name of Isildur was held in honour in Gondor, but\nthey dictated that the South-Kingdom must be ruled by an Heir of\nAnarion. Due to his ancestry from Fíriel and Arvedui, more than a\nmillennium later, Aragorn Elessar put forward his claim as the heir of\nboth Isildur and Anarion.\n\nEärnil laid his claim as being a direct descendant of King Telumehtar\nUmbardacil. His claim was also greatly bolstered by the popularity he\nhad gained as the victorious general who saved Gondor from the\nWainriders after winning the southern theatre of the war. Steward\nPelendur who was temporarily ruling Gondor as serving as arbiter of\nsuccession, intervened in favour of Gondor's victorious general who\nwould rule as Eärnil II.\n\nThe Last Heir of Anárion\n\nDuring the Battle of Fornost, Eärnil II's heir Eärnur led Gondor's\nforces to victory over the Witch-king of Angmar, who was actually the\nLord of the Nazgûl. Although Eärnur wished to fight him, Eärnur's horse\nwas terrified and fled the battle against his wishes. By the time, he\nmastered his horse and returned the Witch-king had fled. Glorfindel the\nElf then prophesied to him that it was better that he not fight the Lord\nof the Nazgûl because “never by the hand of man shall he fall”.\n\nEärnur later ascended to the throne, ruling from Minas Anor (“Tower of\nthe Sun”). During this time, the Ringwraiths captured the city of Minas\nIthil (“Tower of the Moon”), renaming it _Minas Morgul_ (“Tower of Dark\nSorcery”) and taking it as their lair. Minas Anor was renamed _Minas\nTirith_ (Tower of Guard) as a result. The Lord of the Nazgûl repeatedly\nsent messengers to Minas Tirith challenging Eärnur to single combat,\ntaunting him that he had fled out of cowardice from facing him during\nthe Battle of Fornost. Eventually, King Eärnur was overcome by wrath and\nrode with a small company of knights to Minas Morgul, to accept the\nchallenge. They were never heard from again; and so ended the Line of\nAnárion.\n\nThe Stewards of Gondor\n\nThe Ruling Stewards\n\nA long line of hereditary Stewards governed the realm after the\ndisappearance of Eärnur, son of Eärnil, since there was no proof that\nthe last king was dead, and no claimant had enough support to be\naccepted as his successor. The line of Anárion was held to have failed,\nand Gondor was not willing to risk to another Kin-strife, which would\nsurely have destroyed it. Whenever there was a new Steward, he would\nswear an oath to yield rule of Gondor back to the King, in essence only\nan heir of Isildur, if he should ever return. In Gondor, there was no\none who could claim descent from Isildur in direct line, and the\nnorthern line of Arnor had effectively disappeared, so this oath was not\nconsidered seriously. The line of Stewards ruled as Kings, without\nhaving the title. During the War of the Ring, the ruling Steward of\nGondor was Denethor II, and his two sons were Boromir and younger\nFaramir- the latter being the last Ruling Steward of Gondor.\n\nCirion and Eorl\n\nIn TA 2510 when Steward Cirion ruled over Gondor, the nation faced one\nof its greatest perils: an Easterling tribe named the _Balchoth_ invaded\nGondor with mass force. Gondor's army marched to fight the Balchoth but\nwere cut off from Minas Tirith and pushed back in the direction of the\nLimlight.\n\nMessengers were sent to get help from the Éothéod, a tribe, which lived\nin the northern vales of the Anduin, but nobody expected the messengers\nto reach their destination. When certain peril came upon Gondor,\nhowever, the Éothéod turned the tide of the Battle of the Field of\nCelebrant. After the victory the Éothéod were awarded the fields of\nCalenardhon north of the White Mountains from the Gap of Rohan at the\nsouthern end of the Hithaeglir, Fangorn forest, rivers Limlight to\nAnduin, western Emyn Muil, and the Mering Stream, where they established\nthe kingdom of Rohan with Eorl the Young as their first king. A\npermanent alliance between Gondor and Rohan was established by the oath\nEorl swore to Cirion.\n\nThe War of the Ring and the Restoration\n\nSeveral centuries later, Sauron had prepared for the final conquest, and\nin TA 3018 his forces overran Ithilien. The attack was stopped at\nOsgiliath with the destruction of the bridge across the Anduin. The\nfollowing year Minas Tirith faced a larger attack from Mordor, with\nadditional threat from the Corsairs of Umbar. Aragorn summoned the Dead\nMen of Dunharrow to destroy the forces from Umbar, freeing forces in the\nsouth of Gondor to come to the aid of Minas Tirith. Gondor then defeated\nthe army of Mordor with the aid of the Rohirrim in the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields, though with heavy losses. The combined army of the West\nthen carried the battle to Sauron at the Battle of the Morannon, a feint\nto distract Sauron's attention from Frodo Baggins's quest to destroy the\nOne Ring in Mount Doom, thus causing Sauron's destruction and the\nallies' ultimate victory.\n\nAfter the second and final defeat of Sauron, the Kingship was restored,\nwith Aragorn crowned as King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor\nand Gondor. Faramir, last heir of the Ruling Stewards, retained his\noffice as the Steward to the King, and ruled over Gondor's eastern\nregion of Ithilien; a fair land between the river Anduin and the Ephel\nDúath. The oaths between Gondor and Rohan were renewed, and several\njoint campaigns were fought in the east and south against the remnant of\nthe Easterlings and Haradrim; all former territories of the\nSouth-kingdom were won back during the following centuries, and its\npower and wealth were restored. Several Tolkien's writings state that\n_“...of Eldarion son of Elessar it was foretold that he should rule a\ngreat realm, and that it should endure for a hundred generations of men\nafter him, that is until a new age brought in again new things; and from\nhim should come the kings of many realms in long days after”_.\n\n\nArmies\n\nSecond Age\n\nThe soldiers of Gondor were renowned during the Second Age for their\nskill and valour. Training men of Gondor during the Second Age instilled\nwithin their soldiers a martial spirit and ardor, goading them to fight\nto the death against the hordes of Mordor, Rhûn, and Harad. Every man\nwas physically imposing: being very tall at over six feet, very broad,\nand very strong as well. Every single soldier was in peak fighting\ncondition and ready to fight against Sauron's hordes (especially during\nthe War of the Last Alliance). The three major weapons they used were\nspears, longswords, and longbows. They also knew how to form cohesive\nbox-formations, which were sturdy enough for both offensive and\ndefensive purposes. The soldiers wore heavy plate armour and utilised\nlarge shields made out of multi-layered wood and edged in metal for\nreinforcement.\n\nThird Age\n\nGondor's armies prevented Mordor and its allies from overwhelming the\nrest of Middle-earth. Gondor was in a very crucial position, in order to\nguard Middle Earth and because of Gondor's proximity to Mordor, its\nmilitary forces had to be proficiently trained and vigilantly on guard\nat all times. Because of this, they were arguably the strongest country\nthat opposed Sauron. During the Third Age, most of Minas Tirith's armies\nwere trained and drilled to fight in tight infantry formations,\nsupported by archers and cavalry. Their armaments consisted of a\nchainmail undercoat with either a black tabard or plate armor over it.\nTheir standard weapons were long spears, longswords, and longbows,\ncomplimented by tower shields. \n\nMinas Tirith's immediate defenses comprised thousands of infantrymen\nstationed throughout Osgiliath, Cair Andros, and the Rammas Echor. These\nunits were most likely temporary detachments from the city. Minas Tirith\nalso had at least three companies of the elite Guards of the Citadel,\ntasked to defend the upper levels of the city. They wore black robes,\nsurcoats and winged silver crowns. The Guards of the City were not\nallowed to go in the main part of the City in their uniform.\nAdditionally, the sixth level of the city housed stables for a small\nforce of horsemen. Beyond Anduin and the defenses of Minas Tirith\noperated a secretive group of soldiers called the Rangers of Ithilien\nThe Rangers of Ithilien had guerrilla warfare aginst the Southrons,\nallies of Mordor. Similar to the Rangers of the North, the Rangers of\nIthilien were comprised of the remnant of the Dúnedain in their\nrespective Kingdom, in this case being the Dúnedain that once dwelled in\nIthilien.(the Rangers of the North were Arnorian Dúnedain, while the\nRangers of Ithilien are Gondorian- and were more populous than their\nnorthern kin).  Armed with longbows, swords, and spears, these men\nwatched and harassed the enemy throughout Ithilien, much akin to\nguerrilla warfare. The captain of the Rangers of Ithilien during the War\nof the Ring was Faramir, the younger brother of Boromir and the son of\nthe Steward of Gondor, Denethor II.\n\nThe defense of Gondor's fiefdoms were the responsibility of the\nrespective lords of these territories. Their training, strength in\nnumbers, and armaments varied from each fief (Lossarnach brought axemen\nto the aid of Minas Tirith while the men of Morthond Vale consisted of\narchers). The greatest of these fiefs was Dol Amroth, which brought\nforth the largest force to Minas Tirith, made up of men-at-arms and\narguably the best cavalry in Middle Earth- the elite Swan Knights.\n\nGondor's fleet at the time of the War of the Ring was docked at\nPelargir. This port and the Anduin River was essential in the defense of\nMinas Tirith. As made evident by the fiefdom's dire need to defend their\ncoasts and many rivers of Gondor, a majority of the fleet was\nconcentrated at Pelargir. This fleet was destroyed when the Black Ships\nof Umbar attacked, enslaving many of Gondor's sailors into the service\nof Mordor.\n\n\nSong of Gondor\n\n_Gondor! Gondor, between the Mountains and the Sea!_\n\n_West Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver Tree_\n\n_Fell like bright rain in gardens of the Kings of old._\n\n_O proud walls! White towers! O wingéd crown and throne of gold!_\n\n''O Gondor, Gondor! Shall Men behold the Silver Tree, ''\n\n_Or West Wind blow again between the Mountains and the Sea?_\n\nThis was sung by Aragorn on his trip with Legolas and Gimli to find\nPippin and Merry.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Gondor_ name means 'Land of Stone', from Sindarin GOND (stone) + (N)DOR\n(land), most likely given to it because of the White Mountains (Ered\nNimrais) and other mountain chains in the land (hypothetical Quenya name\nONDONÓRË).\n\n\nRegions of Gondor\n\n  Gondor was divided between several nearly\nautonomous regions. These were the following:\n\n-   Ithilien, a region along the east bank of the Anduin river under the\n    shadow of the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow). Ithilien was\n    abandoned and mostly under the control of Mordor during The War of\n    the Ring. (Although Gondor did have secret bases throughout the\n    region such as Henneth Annûn, and the Rangers of Ithilien used\n    guerilla warfare tactics to harass the enemy throughout Ithilien,\n    and disrupt supply lines and companies marching to and from Mordor.\n    After the War of the Ring, Faramir was made Lord Paramount of\n    Ithilien by Aragorn.\n-   South Ithilien, a portion of the the Ithilien south of Osgiliath.\n    The road (the Harad Road) the Southrons took to get to Morder lied\n    here.\n-   Anórien, a strip of land along the northern edge of the White\n    Mountains. Bordered by the Mering Stream and Rohan to the west,\n    Anduin to the east, the Mouths of Entwash to to the north, and\n    theWhite Mountainsand Rammas Echor to the south.\n-   Lossarnach, a heavily-populated farmland region southwest of Minas\n    Tirith.\n-   Lebennin, a plain extending from the White Mountains down to the Bay\n    of Belfalas that bordered Lossarnach.\n-   Belfalas, a fiefdom ruled by the Princes of Dol Amroth.\n-   Dor-en-Ernil, a narrow strip of land along the Bay of Belfalas ruled\n    by the Princes of Dol Amroth.\n-   Lamedon, a plain between the White Mountains and the River Ringló.\n-   Anfalas or _Langstrand_, a narrow strip of land along the sea\n    bordered by the Pinnath Gelin.\n-   Andrast, The western-most province of Gondor located on a narrow\n    peninsula jutting out into the Sea.\n-   Ringló Vale, a mini-province.\n-   Morthond or Blackroot Vale, where Duilin comes from.\n\nThe long cape of Andrast was not populated (by the descendants of\nNúmenóreans, but evidence from the _Unfinished Tales_ suggests that a\nsmall group of Púkel-men inhabited it.)\n\nAdditionally, Gondor held or had held the following regions at certain\npoints in its history:\n\n-   South Gondor or Harondor, an arid region between the rivers Porosand\n    Harnen, which was contested between Gondor and Harad.\n-   Calenardhon, which was given to the Éothéod and became Rohan. It's\n    boundaries were the rivers of Anduin in the east, Isenin the west,\n    Limlightin the north, and the White Mountains/ Mering Stream in the\n    south.\n-   Enedwaith, a region between the rivers Isen and Greyflood. It was\n    never truly populated by Gondor and was soon abandoned.\n-   Rhovanion, which was never fully under the control of Gondor but\n    under Gondorian control at certain times during the Third Age.\n-   Ephel Dúath, the Mountains of Shadow, which was the extreme eastern\n    region of Gondor where she kept watch over Mordor with many\n    fortresses and cities such as Minas Ithil, Durthang, and the Tower\n    of Cirith Ungol. Evil things re-entered Mordor after Gondor's watch\n    upon the land slackened during the Second Age.\n\n\nMajor Sites\n\n Cities, Fortresses, and Strongholds in Gondor included:\n\n-   Cair Andros, an island-fortress in the river Anduin, roughly 40\n    miles north of Osgiliath. Gondor maintained a steady garrison here,\n    as it was of paramount importance to Gondor during the long war with\n    Mordor, in order to prevent the enemy from crossing the river and\n    entering into Anórien.\n\n\n\n-   Calembel, a city in Lamedon.\n-   Dol Amroth, a city in Belfalas ruled by the Prince of Dol Amroth.\n-   Ethring, a ford and a large township built on either side of the\n    river Ringló.\n-   Henneth Annûn, a hidden refuge of Gondorian rangers in the northern\n    part of Ithilien along the Ephel Duath, the Mountains of Shadow.\n-   Linhir, a port city in Lebennin.\n-   Minas Tirith (originally Minas Anor), City of the Kings, the capital\n    (Third Age) and largest city of Gondor.\n-   Osgiliath, a city and former capital of Gondor on the river Anduin,\n    largely destroyed and abandoned by the end of the Third Age. During\n    the War of the Ring, Gondor kept a garrison on the west bank to\n    prevent the Enemy from crossing the river and assaulting Minas\n    Tirith. Osigiliath was the key to besiege Minas Tirith because of\n    its location and access to the river. Although the massive\n    Morgul-host led by the Witch-King to beseige Minas Tirith\n    overwhelmed the garrison, and drove the Gondorians out thus gaining\n    the passage of Anduin- the true beginning of the Siege of Gondor\n    that would conclude at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. King\n    Elessar had it rebuilt after Sauron's downfall.\n-   Pelargir, the great southern harbour, which was captured by the\n    Corsairs during the War of the Ring. The people of Pelargir helped\n    in the Batttle of Pell\n-   Tarnost, a hill-town in Belfalas.\n\nAdditionally, Gondor had held the following locations at certain points\nin its history:\n\n-   Angrenost (Isengard), one of the three Fortresses of Gondor and held\n    within it one of the realm's Palantiri. Its location in Nan\n    Curunir (valley at the end of the Misty Mountains), was at the\n    northwestern corner of the Southern Kingdom of Gondor, guarding the\n    Fords of Isen from enemy incursions into Calenardhon, and together\n    with the fortress of Helm's Deep to its south protected the Gap of\n    Rohan. After Calenardhon was given to the Éothéod by Cirion, Steward\n    of Gondor and became Rohan, Isengard remained part of Gondor, and\n    the company of Aglarond removed to the northern fortress, although\n    the rest of Gondor almost forgot about it. The small guard\n    intermarried much with the Dunlendings , until the place became a\n    Dunlending fortress in all but name. Orthanc, however, remained\n    closed, as the Steward of Gondor still held the keys. Isengard soon\n    came all but deserted.\n-   Durthang, the largest fortress in Mordor, originally built to guard\n    the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow)..\n-   Erech, a town of Gondor that was abandoned by the end of the Third\n    Age. To the north lay the Paths of the Dead.\n-   Minas Ithil, a city founded by Isildur that was originally the\n    sister city of Minas Anor. Located in an upland valley at the feet\n    of the Mountains of Shadow, it was built as a fortress city to\n    defend Gondor from Sauron in Mordor. It was later conquered by\n    the Nazgûl and renamed Minas Morgul.\n-   Tharbad, a city on both sides of the river Greyflood, (at one time\n    held by Gondor in the south and Arnor in the north) but abandoned as\n    Gondor's borders recessed through Enedwaith to the Isen, and later\n    ruined.\n-   Tower of Cirith Ungol, a Tower Fortress in western Mordor built by\n    Gondor to guard the pass of Cirith Ungol from any evil creature\n    trying to enter -or leave- Mordor. The Great Plague wiped out the\n    garrison located here, so it was easily captured when Sauron's\n    minions re-entered Mordor.\n-   Towers of the Teeth, two towers situated on either side of the Black\n    Gate. The two towers, called Carchost and Narchost, that stand on\n    either side of Cirith Gorgor, the Haunted Pass, which lies between\n    the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow), and the Ash\n    Mountains. Originally built by Men of Gondor following the downfall\n    of Sauron at the end of the Second Age, the Towers of the Teeth were\n    eventually taken over by the servants of the Dark Lord. They were\n    then repaired and fortified and were incorporated into the defenses\n    of the pass and gate.\n-   Umbar, the far southern harbour which was lost and reclaimed several\n    times, in the end being the home of Black Númenóreans, the Corsairs\n    of Umbar.\n",

    "text": "ELWING, also known as ELWING THE WHITE, was the daughter of Dior the\nFair and his wife Nimloth. She was the younger sister of the twin\nbrothers Eluréd and Elurín. She became the wife of Eärendil the Mariner,\nand was the mother of Elrond and Elros.\n\n\nBiography\n\nElwing, as well as her brothers, were born in a house near Lanthir\nLamath and lived there until her father went to Doriath to assume his\ninheritance as King of Doriath.\n\nWhen the Sons of Fëanor attacked Doriath, all of her immediate family\nwas either killed or lost, but those loyal to her family took Elwing as\nwell as the Silmaril they sought and bore her away to the Havens of\nSirion.\n\nIt was at the Havens that Elwing met Eärendil and later married him. She\nbore him twin sons, Elrond and Elros. Elrond later went on to marry Lady\nCelebrian, daughter of Lord Celeborn and Lady Galadriel of Lothlórien.\nFrom this marriage they produced three children, Elladan and Elrohir,\ntwin brothers, and Arwen Undómiel, future Queen of Gondor. These\nchildren were therefore Elwing's grandchildren, a privilege shared with\nthe Lord and Lady of Lothlórien. In the present matter at hand, Elwing\nwas forced to abandon her children when the Sons of Fëanor came for the\nSilmaril in Elwing's possession. Rather than give it over, she threw\nherself into the Sea and was transformed into a great white bird.\n\nShe flew continuously until she found her husband's sailing ship, the\nVingilot. Then, on behalf of the Elves and Men of Middle-earth, they\nchose to sail for Valinor in the faint hope that they could make a final\nplea on behalf of those who suffered under Morgoth.\n\nWhen they arrived, Elwing chose to accompany her husband onto the\nshores, even though she knew it might mean her death. While Eärendil\njourneyed to visit the Valar, Elwing walked the shores, eventually\nmeeting the Elves of Alqualondë. There, she told them the tale of what\nwas happening in Middle-earth and became much loved by them.\n\nThe Valar eventually agreed to go to war to aid those in Middle-earth,\nand also decided to give both Eärendil and Elwing the choice of which\nkindred they would belong. Eärendil, out of respect for his wife,\nallowed her to choose for the both of them. She chose to be counted\namong the elves, in honor of her foremother, Lúthien.\n\nA white tower was later built for Elwing where she could live. It was\nalso said that the birds taught her their language and that she would\nfly to meet Eärendil when he returned from his nightly voyages.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name ELWING means “Star-foam”, from the Sindarin _el_ (“star”) and\n_wing_ (“foam, spray”).\n\n\nGallery",

Only a few actual Rohirric\nwords are given by Tolkien: _kûd-dûkan_, an old word meaning\n“hole-dweller” which led to _kuduk_, the name the Hobbits had for\nthemselves. Even these terms were translated in the book: “hobbit” is\nsaid to derive from the Anglo-Saxon construction “hol-bytla”, or\nhole-builder.\n\nThe only other Rohirric given is the element “lô–”/“loh–” corresponding\nto Anglo-Saxon “éo” (horse), and the derived names _Lôgrad_ for\n_Horse-Mark_, and _Lohtûr_ for _Éothéod_, horse-people, or horse-land.\n\nAll names beginning with Éo– are actually names beginning with Lô– or\nLoh–, but the real forms of Éomer, Éowyn etc. are not given.

    "text": "THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH (abbreviated sometimes\nas HOME, and here as THOME) is a 13-volume series of books that collects\nand analyses material relating to Middle-earth, twelve of which were\ncompiled and edited by the son of J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien.\n\nMost of the content consists of earlier versions of already published\nworks by Tolkien, while other portions are completely new material.\nThese books are extremely detailed, to the point of documenting scraps\nof paper (of J.R.R. Tolkien's) that had been erased multiple times with\nmany footnotes. Christopher Tolkien thoroughly documents the history of\nthe writing of the Middle-earth stories, with as much detail as his\nfather documented the fictional history of Middle-earth itself.\n\nThe first two books introduce readers to _The Book of Lost Tales_, a\nmythology for England from which Tolkien drew ideas that eventually\nbecame the 'Silmarillion' mythology. The next three books follow the\nhistory of the emerging early mythology usually known as _The\nSilmarillion_. The discussion of the published book is deferred until\nbook ten. Books six through nine discuss the development of _The Lord of\nthe Rings_, book nine's second half discussing the Númenor story (the\nfirst versions of which were covered in Book Five). Book ten and eleven\ndiscuss the _Annals of Beleriand_ and _Annals of Aman_, which works were\ndeveloped together with the _Silmarillion_ tradition and which also\nserved as source material for the published Silmarillion. Book twelve\ndiscusses the development of the Appendices to _The Lord of the Rings_,\nfollowed by some assorted essays from Tolkien's last years of life.\n\n1.  _The Book of Lost Tales Part One_ (1983)\n2.  _The Book of Lost Tales Part Two_ (1984)\n3.  _The Lays of Beleriand_ (1985)\n4.  _The Shaping of Middle-earth_ (1986)\n5.  _The Lost Road and Other Writings_ (1987)\n6.  _The Return of the Shadow_ (The History of The Lord of the Rings\n    v.1) (1988)\n7.  _The Treason of Isengard_ (The History of The Lord of the Rings v.2)\n    (1989)\n8.  _The War of the Ring_ (The History of The Lord of the Rings v.3)\n    (1990)\n9.  _Sauron Defeated_ (The History of The Lord of the Rings v.4) (1992)\n10. _Morgoth's Ring_ (The Later Silmarillion v.1) (1993)\n11. _The War of the Jewels_ (The Later Silmarillion v.2) (1994)\n12. _The Peoples of Middle-earth_ (1996)\n13. _The History of Middle-earth: Index_ (2002)\n\nThe thirteenth volume, _The History of Middle-earth: Index,_ completely\nintegrates all the indices from the other twelve books into one large\nindex."

    "text": "UNFINISHED TALES (fully titled _UNFINISHED TALES OF NÚMENOR AND\nMIDDLE-EARTH_) is a collection of stories by J.R.R. Tolkien that were\nnever completed during his lifetime, but were edited and concluded by\nhis son Christopher Tolkien and published in 1980.\n\n\nPublication and edition\n\nUnlike _The Silmarillion_, in which the narrative fragments were\nmodified to connect into a consistent and coherent work, the _Unfinished\nTales_ are presented as Tolkien left them, with little more than names\nchanged (the author having had a confusing habit of trying out different\nnames for a character while writing a draft). Thus some of these are\nincomplete stories, while others are collections of “factual”\ninformation about Middle-earth. Each tale is followed by a long series\nof Christopher's notes explaining inconsistencies and obscure points.\n\nAs with _The Silmarillion_, Christopher Tolkien edited and published\n_Unfinished Tales_ before he had finished his study of the materials in\nhis father's archive. Despite its shortcomings in editorial consistency,\n_Unfinished Tales_ does provide more detailed information about\ncharacters, events and places mentioned only briefly in _The Lord of the\nRings_. Versions of such tales including the origins of Gandalf and the\nWizards, the death of Isildur and the loss of the One Ring in the\nGladden Fields, and the founding of the kingdom of Rohan help expand\nknowledge about Middle-earth.\n\nOf particular note is the tale of Tar-Aldarion and Erendis (chapter two\nof Part Two), the only known story of Númenor before its fall. A map of\nNúmenor is also included in the book.\n\nThe _Unfinished Tales_ had commercial success, demonstrating that the\ndemand for Tolkien's stories several years after his death was not only\nstill present, it was actually growing. Considering this, Christopher\nTolkien began to embark upon the more ambitious twelve-volume work\nentitled _The History of Middle-earth_ which encompassed nearly the\nentire corpus of Tolkien's writings about Middle-earth.\n\n\nContents\n\nPart One: The First Age:\n\n-   “Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin”\n-   “Narn i Chîn Húrin (The Tale of the Children of Húrin)”\n\nPart Two: The Second Age:\n\n-   “A Description of the Island of Númenor”\n-   “Aldarion and Erendis: The Mariner's Wife”\n-   “The Line of Elros: Kings of Númenor”\n-   “The History of Galadriel and Celeborn”\n\nPart Three: The Third Age:\n\n-   “The Disaster of the Gladden Fields”\n-   “Cirion and Eorl and the Friendship of Gondor and Rohan”\n-   “The Quest of Erebor”\n-   “The Hunt for the Ring”\n-   “The Battles of the Fords of Isen”\n\nPart Four\n\n-   “The Drúedain”\n-   “The Istari”\n-   “The Palantíri”"

    "title": "Minas Tirith",
    "page_id": "240",
    "text": "MINAS TIRITH  (IPA:\n) was the capital of Gondor in the Third Age and the Fourth Age of\nMiddle-earth. Originally known as MINAS ANOR, the “Tower of the Setting\nSun”, it replaced the city Osgiliath as the new capital and stockade of\nGondor.\n\nWhen the Enemy began to take shape again, Minas Anor was renamed Minas\nTirith, the “Tower of Guard.” The city was also called THE WHITE CITY,\nas the courtyard in the front of the city's Citadel contained the White\nTree. Many important events took place in and in front of the city, such\nas the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the healing of Éowyn by Aragorn\nafter the battle, and the coronation of Aragorn II Elessar.\n\n\nLayout\n\nMinas Tirith was surrounded by the Rammas Echor, a large ringwall\nencircling the city and the Pelennor Fields. This wall was built after\nMinas Ithil fell and was renamed Minas Morgul. It was repaired by\nEcthelion II during the time of the War of the Ring, but it had not the\nstrength to defend the city from the Dark Lord Sauron's legions of\nUruk-hai from Mordor. The city itself lay on a hill beneath Mount\nMindolluin, which rose above the city's citadel, by a length of a couple\nof thousand feet. Mount Mindolluin was where Aragorn found the seedling\nof the White Tree. \n\nThe city was divided into seven one-hundred-foot high levels, each\nsurrounded by white walls, except the first walls which had the same\nkind of black stone as Orthanc as a face. The gates connecting the\nlevels did not lay behind one another in a line, but faced in different\ndirections. A spur of rock, whose summit was level with the city's\nuppermost tier, jutted out from the front of the city in an easterly\ndirection, dividing all but the first level into two. Each level was\nscattered with many alleys, narrow passageways, and full-fledged houses\n(which were probably quite rare in the city). On the sixth level were\nlocated the Houses of Healing, surrounded by pleasant gardens. Finally,\nwithin the seventh wall, was the Citadel of Minas Tirith, with the White\nTower of Ecthelion - three hundred feet high, so that its apex was one\nthousand feet above the plain.\n\nLevels\n\n\n\nThe First Level of Minas Tirith was the lowest level of Minas Tirith\nwhere was the Main gate.\n\nDuring the Siege of Minas Tirith, Uruk-hai cast fire into the First\nLevel, burning many buildings and causing general havoc to many of the\ndefenders. Later on, the Main Gate was breached when Grond was finally\nused against it, and the soldiers of Gondor and Uruk-hai clashed in the\nstreets of the First Circle but Aragorn ordered a retreat and then made\ntheir way up.\n\n\nHistory\n\nMinas Tirith (as Minas Anor) was built in SA 3320. King Ostoher rebuilt\nthe city in TA 420, and, gradually, it became more important than\nOsgiliath, the original capital, which in later years fell into ruin.\nKing Tarondor finally moved the King's House to the city in TA 1640,\nthereby making it the official capital of the kingdom of Gondor. In the\nyear TA 2002, the White City's companion tower Minas Ithil (the “Tower\nof the Moon”) on the borders of Mordor was captured by the Ringwraiths\nand renamed Minas Morgul (the “Tower of Sorcery”). Minas Anor was then\nrenamed Minas Tirith, meaning the “Tower of Guard”, to indicate that,\nsince the fall of Minas Ithil, Minas Tirith was the only thing that\ndefended Gondor and all the other lands around and behind it against the\ndarkness from Mordor. The Rammas Echor, the great wall encircling the\nrich farmlands and suburbs of the City, was built at this time.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nMinas Tirith only has Gondorian soldiers while the civilians dwell in\nOsgiliath with several Gondorian soldiers. After the Uruk-hai attacked\nand overran Osgiliath a thousand soldiers were killed while the\nremaining thousand soldiers fled to Minas Tirith while the civilians\nwere evacuated to Rohan. The remaining gondorian soldiers entered\nOsgiliath and once the uruk-hai were slain the civilians departed from\nRohan and returned to Osgiliath.\n\nSiege of Minas Tirith\n\nMinas Tirith was besieged by the armies of Mordor, under the Great\nDarkness generated by Sauron's power. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields\ntook place on March 15, 3019 in the fields surrounding the city. It was\na very large battle. Theoden, the King of Rohan was killed during this\nbattle by the Witch-king of Angmar. At about the same time, the\nWitch-king was destroyed by Éowyn, lady of Rohan, who was severely\nwounded in the process. It was also there that Gandalf took command of\nthe City's defenses from the Ruling Steward Denethor after he fell to\ndespair. Aragorn later arrived at the hour of need with Gondor's Army of\nthe South which he had liberated from defending the port city of\nPelargir, turning the tide of battle in favor of the Free Peoples. After\nthe battle, the stench of death was heavy in Minas Tirith's air, and the\nPelennor Fields lay strewn with bodies.\n\nFourth Age\n\nOn 1 May 3019, the Crowning of King Elessar took place on the plain\noutside Minas Tirith. After his coronation, he entered the city as the\nKing of Gondor, as he was destined to become from the start of his\nlifetime. With his coronation, King Elessar refounded the line of the\nKings of Gondor, and as he was also the King of the Kingdom of Arnor,\nMinas Tirith became Capital of the Reunited Kingdom.\n\nMinas Tirith was repaired by its new king (who grew plants inside of its\nwalls to add to its luster and beauty) and by the Dwarves of Glittering\nCaves, particularly Gimli, who built a new gate for the city (made of\nmithril and steel) and altogether fixed the layout of the city as well.\nMinas Tirith was said to have been made even more beautiful than when it\nwas at the time of its founding. The city is known to have stood firm\nand strong well into the Fourth Age because of these two renovations.\n\nIn _The Silmarillion_, as Of The Ring Of Power And The Third Age says,\nafter War of the Ring, the city is referred to as Minas Anor again after\nthe overthrow of Sauron and the destruction of Barad-dûr.\n",

    "text": "LINDON was a Elven Kingdom founded by Gil-galad at the beginning of the\nSecond Age. It was the longest-standing Eldarin Kingdom in the history\nof Middle-earth, and the mightiest throughout the Second Age. It was\nruled by its founder, Gil-galad, the High King of the Ñoldor, who,\nduring that age, was the strongest and most powerful enemy of Sauron in\nMiddle-earth.\n\nThe realm endured through the Third Age, though diminished, and was the\nsite of the Grey Havens, where the Elves, as well as the Ring-bearers,\nsailed to the Undying Lands.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nLindon was located in what remained of Ossiriand; the Land of Seven\nRivers and all that was left of the peninsula of Beleriand after the War\nof Wrath. The mountains, partially sunk in the ruin of Beleriand,\nformed a portion of the realm's east border. The realm reached as far\nnorth over the mountains as the Little Lune. North of that boundary was\nwhat remained of the Dwarf kingdom of Belegost. After the ruin of\nBeleriand, Gil-Galad founded the realm of Lindon, which encompassed all\nthe land west of the Blue Mountains and east of the sea in the North of\nMiddle-earth. The Gulf of Lune broke the realm of Lindon into Forlindon\nand Harlindon. The Grey Havens lay at the mouth of the river Lune.\nThrough a break in the Blue Mountains, the land of Eriador lay to the\neast, and farther southeast laid the Shire. Eastward also lay the\nKingdom of Eregion, at the feet of the Misty Mountains, which was also\nruled by Gil-Galad under the lordship of Celebrimbor. Towards the\nend of the Second Age, the realm of Arnor was established by Elendil to\nthe northeast of Lindon.\n\nThe lands of Lindon were said to be lush and green, with thick forests\nlining the foothills of the Blue Mountains. The havens of the elves were\nfound along the Gulf of Lune, where the land became rocky yet lush along\nthe coast. Tolkien stated that Lindon was Elven country “where no Man\ndwells”. It was the last realm that was fair and free. It also had a\nmildly tempered climate, with mild winters and mild summers.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the Second Age\n\n_Lindon_ was another name for the Ossiriand in East Beleriand, where the\nLaiquendi dwelt.\n\nSecond Age\n\nAfter the War of Wrath, those Elves who had sought refuge on the coast\nof the sea at the mouths of the river Sirion removed into the land that\nwas left in the northwest of Middle-earth. They, led by Gil-Galad,\nestablished the realm of Lindon in SA 1. In the North at Forlindon\nGil-galad ruled a majority of Noldorin Elves. In southern Harlindon,\nCeleborn ruled a fiefdom of many Sindar and the remaining Green Elves of\nBeleriand under Gil-Galad. He did not rule under Gil-galad for long,\nthough, eventually removing to the shores of Lake Nenuial with his wife,\nGaladriel. At the Grey Havens Círdan was the lord of many shipbuilders\nof the Teleri who survived the ruin of the First Age. The Elves believed\nnow that the threat of Morgoth was removed, and Lindon became a fair\nkingdom. Gil-galad and the Elves of Lindon had a very strong friendship\nwith Númenor and its kings before the Darkening of Númenor.\n\nEarly in the sixth century of the Second Age, the first ships of Númenor\nreturned to Middle-earth. Vëantur, father-in-law of Tar-Meneldur, led\nthe first expedition. Later he returned with his grandson and heir to\nthe throne, Aldarion, and the Númenoreans were well liked by Gil-galad\nand his people. Tar-Aldarion continued his voyages to Lindon throughout\nhis reign as the sixth King of Númenor, and Gil-galad and Círdan taught\nmuch to the mariners of Númenor. Gil-galad befriended Aldarion and gave\nhim and his father, Tar-Meneldur, many gifts. After the reign of\nAldarion, Númenor was less active in the affairs of Lindon for many\nhundred years, though friendship remained.\n\nIn the twelfth century, Sauron attempted to infiltrate Lindon disguised\nas 'Annatar', the Lord of Gifts. His strength now on the mend after\nMorgoth's defeat, Sauron purposed to corrupt the strongest of all the\nremaining Elf-kingdoms. Gil-galad denied him, and so did Elrond, who\ndwelt then with the King in Forlindon. Though they did not know\nAnnatar's true identity at the time, the wise king of Lindon foresaw\nevil in Annatar. Sauron then turned his attention to Eregion, where he\nsucceeded in befriending the Noldorin smiths under Celebrimbor who\nworked there.\n\n\n\nAfter Sauron forged the One Ring at the beginning of the sixth century,\nhe declared war on the Elf-kingdoms to capture the Rings of Power they\nhad hidden from him. Gil-galad sent a small army led by Elrond east to\nthe aid of Eregion. There he joined with Celeborn, but Sauron's forces\ndefeated the combined force. His army ravaged Eregion and the rest of\nEriador, and came to the borders of Lindon. There, Gil-galad's forces\ndug in against the forces of Sauron, and were strengthened by a great\nfleet sent from Númenor by Tar-Minastir, the King of Númenor, under his\nson and heir Ciryatan. With the aid of the Númenoreans, participating in\ntheir first war upon Middle-Earth, Lindon was freed and Sauron's forces\noverthrown. Sauron returned to Mordor and focused his attention now on\nruining Númenor.\n\nIn the year SA 3319 of the Second Age, Númenor was destroyed, and\nElendil and sons and his remnant of Faithful Númenoreans landed on the\ncoast of Middle-earth. Elendil established the Realms in Exile which\nwere the North-Kingdom of Arnor and the South-Kingdom of Gondor. He\nbecame close friends and ally with Gil-galad, and they pledged support\nto one another against the preparing blow of Sauron, who had risen to\npower once again after fleeing the ruin of Númenor.\n\nThe War of the Last Alliance began in SA 3434, and the Elves of Lindon\nformed a large part of the backbone of the Elven armies. Elendil's\nNúmenorean refugees, along with Dúnedain who had removed to Middle-Earth\nbefore the destruction of Númenor, marched alongside the host of\nGil-galad, and eventually they laid siege to the Dark Tower. Sauron\nhimself then came to battle, and fought Gil-galad and Elendil. The two\nkings defeated him but died in the process. Then, Isildur son of Elendil\ncut the ring from Sauron's hand, and he was for a time defeated.\n\nThird Age\n\nAfter the death of Gil-galad, the lordship of Lindon passed to Círdan;\nand the line of Noldorin kings in Middle-Earth came to an end. The\npopulation of Lindon had been reduced by the long and bloody war with\nSauron. With the loss of their king, many of the Noldor and Sindar left\nfor Valinor. Following the war, many Elves began to come to the Grey\nHavens and sail to Valinor, further depleting Lindon's population.\nCírdan continued his shipbuilding, and had much work constructing the\nvessels to carry the Elves west. However, the kingdom began to dwindle\nas the ships continued to sail.\n\nThe Witch-king of Angmar attacked the Kingdom of Arnor in the thirteenth\ncentury of the Third Age. Lindon lent what aid it could to the Dúnedain,\nbut after many years, the North-Kingdom was overthrown. The Dúnedain\nwent into exile, and the kingdom of Lindon shrank rapidly into a safe\nhaven for the Elves of Middle-earth. By the time of the War of the Ring,\nit was a shadow of its former glory, with only Grey Havens seeing\nregular traffic and activity. After Sauron's defeat, the last Elves\nbegan to sail for Valinor, and Círdan remained there well into the\nFourth Age, awaiting the last ship to sail west himself.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _LINDON_ means “Land of the Singers”, from the Quenya term\n_lin_ or _lind_ (“to sing, make musical sound”) and _-on_, which\nis a common suffix for regions.",

    "text": "The MISTY MOUNTAINS, also named the _HITHAEGLIR_ , was a mountain range that\nran 1280 kilometres (795.35 miles) from north to south between Eriador\nand the valley of the Great River, Anduin, and from Mount Gundabad in\nthe far north to Methedras in the south.\n\nAn early version of this range's name was _ERED HITHUI_ .\n\n\nGeographical description\n\n\n\nThe range's notable peaks were Caradhras, Celebdil, Fanuidhol, Mount\nGundabad, and Methedras.\n\nLocation\n\nThe northernmost peak of the Misty Mountains was Mount Gundabad; where\naccording to legend Durin (eldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves)\nawoke, though it became an abode and mountain-fortress of Orcs.\n\nThe greatest Dwarven realm in Middle-Earth, Khazad-dûm (later named\nMoria), was located at the midpoint of the Misty Mountains. The three\npeaks that were part of Khazad-dûm were Caradhras (Redhorn), Celebdil\n(Silvertine) and Fanuidhol (Cloudyhead). Inside Celebdil, the Dwarves\nbuilt the Endless Stair, from the foundations of the mountain to the top\nof it. The southernmost peak of the Misty Mountains was Methedras,\nmeaning “the Last Peak”.\n\nRoutes through the Misty Mountains\n\nThe most important passes were the High Pass and the Redhorn Pass. There\nwas also a pass at the source of the Gladden river.\n\nRoutes around the Misty Mountains\n\nThe Gap of Rohan was the valley (probably of the River Isen) between the\nsouthernmost peaks of the Misty Mountains and the northernmost of the\nWhite Mountains. There may have been a gap between Mount Gundabad in the\nMisty Mountains and the westernmost extremity of the Grey Mountains,\nthough published maps differ on this point. \n\nInhabitants\n\nUnder the Misty Mountains were the former Dwarf realm of Khazad-dum, and\nthe “Goblin-town” in which Bilbo Baggins stumbled across the One Ring,\nwhich had been in the possession of the creature Gollum, who also dwelt\nthere himself on the eastern side. Rivendell was hidden in the foothills\nof the Misty Mountains at the western end of the High Pass.\n\nCarn Dûm, where the Witch-King of Angmar resided for several centuries\nin the Third Age, lay between a western spur of the northern extreme of\nthe range, known as the Mountains of Angmar. Mount Gundabad, the largest\nGoblin dwelling in the Misty Mountains, was located south-east of\nAngmar.\n\nIsengard lay centered around the Tower of Orthanc in Nan Curunír, the\nvalley between the arms of Methedras, which was the southernmost peak of\nthe Misty Mountains. The “stone-giants” also inhabited this mountain\nrange, as told in _The Hobbit_.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Misty Mountains were created by Melkor during the Time of the Trees,\nwho wanted to make it difficult for Oromë, who often rode across\nMiddle-earth hunting his fell beasts, to pass.\n\nYears of the Trees\n\nThe Dwarves of Durin awoke under Mount Gundabad and later established\nthe caves of Khazad-dûm. Later, when the Elves on their Great Journey to\nValinor looked upon their terrible height a portion of the Teleri, later\nknown as the Nandor grew afraid and turned south down the Great River.\nThousands of years later, the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth and\nestablished great realms in the Beleriand and in the highlands, but they\nnever crossed the mountains or established realms within them.\n\nFirst and Second Ages\n\nOver three-hundred years into the First Age, the tribes of Men crossed\nthe Misty Mountains and began migrating into the Beleriand, first the\nEdain and then later the Easterlings or Swarthy Men. After the defeat of\nMorgoth, the surviving orcs and a Balrog came to live there and would\nremain a problem for over six-thousand years. The Easterling men who\nfought with Morgoth crossed the mountains and began living east of the\nWilderland in Rhûn. The Great Eagles also began living here in a place\nknown as the Eagles Eyrie.\n\nThe great Dwarven realm of Khazad-dûm beneath the Misty Mountains\nthrived as good relations with the Ñoldor of Eregion were established,\nuntil Sauron invaded Eriador from Mordor and the east destroying Eregion\nand ravaging the lands beyond. The dwarves survived by shutting\nthemselves in Khazad-dûm behind the Doors of Durin.\n\nThird Age\n\nIn TA 1980, the great Dwarven realm of Khazad-dûm came to an end when\nthe Dwarves unearthed a Balrog which led to its desertion by TA 1981,\nafter which it was known as Moria (literally, “black chasm”). Slowly,\nthe Misty Mountains became increasingly perilous and dangerous to\ntravelers as Goblins and other creatures came to dwell under there.\n\nAlmost a thousand years later, the thirteen Dwarves, Gandalf, and Bilbo\nBaggins used the High Pass to cross the Misty Mountains during the Quest\nfor the Lonely Mountain, and were captured by Goblins whilst crossing.\nUnder the mountains, the Great Goblin was slain, and Bilbo found the One\nRing.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring tried to cross the Redhorn Pass (after\nrejecting the High Pass leading to Rhovanion as being watched by the\nEnemy, and the Gap of Rohan as taking the Fellowship too close to\nIsengard), but a blizzard forced it to go under the mountain instead of\nover it. They faced a Balrog that dwelt in the deserted realm of\nKhazad-dûm. Gandalf slew the Balrog by casting it down from Zirakzigil,\nbut it had worn his life already, and on that high ground he lay until\nGwaihir bore him to Lothlorien.",

    "text": "The WHITE MOUNTAINS or ERED NIMRAIS was a mountain range in\nMiddle-earth that lay east-to-west across the length of Gondor.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe mountains were named after the glaciers of their highest peaks. The\nrange lay mostly East-West, but also had a northern section, which was\nseparated from the main line of the Misty Mountains by the Gap of Rohan.\nEven at the southern latitude of Gondor and Rohan, the White Mountains\nbore snow even in summer, suggesting they were extremely high. The range\nhad no passes. The Paths of the Dead passed under it, but only the most\ncourageous (or foolhardy) ever ventured that route. The White Mountains\nformed the northern boundary of Gondor and the southern boundary of\nRohan except in their easternmost provinces, where Gondor's province of\nAnorien lay to the north of the mountains.\n\nBecause of their always bearing snow at their highest peaks, the White\nMountains must have been at least 4800 meters (16'000 feet) above sea\nlevel, with occasional peaks probably in excess of 5500 meters. They\nwere, however, not as high as the Misty Mountains.\n\nIts notable peaks included _Irensaga_ “Iron Saw” and _Starkhorn_.\nBetween these two lay the _Dwimorberg_, entrance to the Paths of the\nDead.\n\nAt the eastern end, the city of Minas Tirith was carved into\n_Mindolluin_ mountain. The Warning beacons of Gondor were placed on top\nof seven peaks in the range: _Amon Dîn_, _Eilenach_, _Nardol_, _Erelas_,\n_Min-Rimmon_, _Calenhad_ and _Halifirien_.\n\nSeveral rivers raised in the White Mountains, among them: the Adorn (a\ntributary of Isen), and the Snowbourn and Mering Stream (tributaries of\nthe Entwash); and, on the south side, the Erui (a tributary of Anduin),\nthe Ringló and its tributary Ciril (which together with the Morthond all\nentered the Bay of Belfalas at Edhellond near Dol Amroth), the Lefnui of\nthe Anfalas, and the Five Rivers of Lebennin.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe natives to the White Mountains were Drúedain who inhabited this\nregion in the Second Age. The only remnants of the Druedain's presence\nin this mountain range were their statues called the _Púkel-men_.\nSometime thereafter, evil men related to the Dunlendings drove the\nDrúedain out. Some of these men swore allegiance to Isildur, but\nbetrayed him and were cursed into the Army of the Dead. Aragorn,\nLegolas, and Gimli followed the Paths of the Dead in year 3019 of the\nThird Age and convinced the army to fight for Gondor in the War of the\nRing. After they did so, Aragorn released the Army of the Dead, for they\nhad fulfilled their oath. After and perhaps before the War of the Ring\nDwarves settled in the White Mountain, where they could have better\ncontact with their allies.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ERED NIMRAIS_ is a Sindarin name: _Ered_ ('Mountains') and _Nimrais_\n('White peaks')",

    "text": "The DRÚADAN FOREST also known as the TAWAR-IN-DRÚEDAIN was a\npine forest in Gondor, located in Anorien, which was north of Minas\nTirith. The forest was inhabited by a strange folk of men known as the\nDrúedain, the Wild Men of the Woods or Wood Woses. \n\nAccording to the _The Atlas of Middle-earth_, the forest was over forty\nmiles in total length. The highest point in the Drúadan Forest is\nEilenach which was the sixth Beacons and could be seen from the west.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe forest had been occupied by the Drúadan since sometime between or\nsometime after the Second Age years: SA 883 and SA 1075. It was known\nfor being avoided by outsiders. The forest is remembered most for\nwhen the Riders of Rohan where guided through the forest on their way to\nthe relief of Minas Tirith, by their leader Ghân-buri-Ghân. There was a\nroad there, created long ago by the “Stonehouse-folk” (Men of Gondor),\nthat everyone except the Wild Men had forgotten. It would have taken the\nDrúedain from sunrise to noon to walk it, but it required around ten\nhours for all of Rohan's army to get through. Each company of soldiers\nwas guided by a Wild Man, who also sent out scouts to keep their\nmovements secret. Movement through the forest keep the army from being\nspotted by the enemy.\n\nIn the Fourth Age, King Aragorn II Elessar declared that the men of the\nforest would have the land to themselves because of their help during\nthe war."

    "text": "The BATTLE OF FORNOST was the decisive battle between the forces of\nAngmar, under the Witch-king, and of Eärnur, the Crown Prince of Gondor,\nin the year TA 1975 that ended the evil northern Kingdom of Angmar.\n\n\nHistory\n\nA year prior to the battle, the armies of Angmar conquered Arthedain,\nthe last realm of Arnor. Angmar's armies had taken Fornost, the capital\nof the Dúnedain, and Arvedui, the last King of Arnor, had drowned in the\nIce-Bay of Forochel. A year later, a fleet of ships under Eärnur arrived\nin the Grey Havens and set off toward what was left of the once-great\nnorthern kingdom. With the armies of Gondor came men from Rhovanion,\nelves from Lindon, and the remainder of the Dúnedain (among them\nAranarth, the Prince of Arthedain). According to Shire historians, a\ncompany of archers was also sent to the battle.\n\nThe battle itself did not take place in the city of Fornost, but on the\nplains to the west of the city, near Lake Evendim. The armies of Angmar\nhurried west to meet the assault, and seeing this, the cavalry of Gondor\nrode north into the Hills of Evendim to wait in ambush. As the main part\nof the army of Gondor met the enemy in battle, the Gondor cavalry set\nout from the hills to strike the rear of the army of Angmar. This served\nas the turning point in the battle, and allowed the combined armies of\nthe west to gain the advantage. Realizing that his forces were all but\ncompletely destroyed, the Witch-king of Angmar fled eastward. As he\nfled, an army led by Glorfindel came up out of the south and blocked his\nescape, destroying what was left of his crumbling army; the Witch-king\nhimself was able to escape during the night and fled southward. Though\nthe battle itself had been lost and Angmar utterly destroyed, Sauron was\nextremely pleased with the Witch-King's work, for the destruction of the\nnorthern kingdoms of the Dúnedain was a victory for the Dark Powers\nwhich far exceeded the loss of the Witch-King's realm."

She bore him a son Eldacar, but many of the people\nof Gondor of Númenórean blood were angered by this mixing of blood of\nMiddle Men and Númenóreans, and the coastal provinces rebelled when\nValacar grew old.\n\n\nCivil War\n\nWhen in TA 1432 Eldacar succeeded his father the unrest grew into open\nrebellion, as many people saw Eldacar as a half-breed who had no right\nto rule. The chief of them was his distant relative Castamir the\nUsurper, Lord of Ships, who in TA 1437 usurped the throne, forcing\nEldacar into exile. Castamir was supported by the people of the realm of\nUmbar, who sought revenge against Gondor. During the rebellion Osgiliath\nwas burned, and the great Dome of Stars was lost, together with its\nPalantír. Castamir also murdered Eldacar's son and heir Ornendil.\nEldacar fled to Rhovanion, and Castamir ruled in his stead.\n\nA full decade later, in TA 1447, Eldacar returned with Rhovanion troops;\nat the same time a rebellion against Castamir's cruel rule took place.\nEldacar managed to kill Castamir at the Battle of Erui, but Castamir's\nsons and many of their supporters fled south to Umbar. Eldacar could not\nfollow them, as the fleet was under Castamir's control.\n\nNot only did Gondor lose the city of Umbar for four centuries and gain a\nnew enemy in the Corsairs of Umbar, descendants of Castamir's sons, but\nalso many of the Númenóreans of purest blood were killed during the\ncivil war, leaving Gondor weakened.\n\nThe Kin-strife was, along with the Great Plague and sheer laziness one\nof the chief reasons for the abandonment of the fortresses in and\nsurrounding Mordor."

    "title": "Dunland",
    "page_id": "579",
    "text": "DUNLAND was the land of the wild men, or 'Dunlendings'. _Dunland_ means\n_Hill Land_ in the language of neighboring Rohan, whose people named it\nafter arriving in nearby Calenardhon in the later Third Age.\n\n\nInhabitants\n\nDunland was inhabited by the Dunlendings, Men who were mostly bearded\nand had dirty faces, and long matted hair. They wore clothes of leather\nand animal skin and carried weapons that were simple but effective for\ntheir purpose. They usually fought with clubs and pitchforks, and at\ntimes they carried torches to act as lights at night and to burn\nbuildings by day. The buildings that Dunlendings lived and worked in\nwere crude shacks of wood and animal skin that were often sabotaged by\nWargs and sometimes the Rohirrim.\n\nThe vernacular of this land's inhabitants, including possibly the\nStoors, was Dunlendish.\n\nAncestors of the Dunlendings inhabited the forested regions of\nMiddle-earth on either side of the Gwathló in the early Second Age; thus\nthe early Númenóreans called them _Gwaithuirim_. They spoke a language\nrelated to that of the Second House of Men, the Haladin, rather than the\nvastly different Bëorian-Marachian tongue which stood at the base of\nAdûnaic, and this lack of mutual understanding led to outright\nhostility. The Númenóreans greedily harvested _Gwaithuirim_ forests for\ntimber, and after much war and bloodshed, the _Gwaithuirim_ from south\nof the Gwathló fled east to the Hithaeglir while others scattered to the\ncape of Eryn Vorn and the White Mountains.\n\nAt the end of the Second Age, the land north of the Gwathló and south of\nthe Baranduin was named Minhiriath “Land between the Rivers”, although\nthe land south of Minhiriath remained unnamed. Its inhabitants were\nlargely ignored despite the fact that the Gondor colonial city of\nTharbad grew up on the Gwathló west of the Misty Mountain hillfolk who\nhad been _Gwaithuirim_ long before. It was not until Gondor abandoned\nthis city in TA 2050 that the people and their land were renamed: both\nbecame known as Enedwaith “Middle-Folk, Middle Region”, because they\nowed no allegiance to the North or South Kingdom.\n\nThe Hillfolk of the Hithaeglir kept their hatred of the descendants of\nNúmenor (unlike those of Eryn Vorn and the White Mountains, who\nnevertheless remained uncooperative). The Dead Men of Dunharrow who\nbetrayed Isildur were descended from _Gwaithurim_.\n\nIn T.A. 2770, Smaug the Dragon destroyed the Kingdom under the Mountain.\nDwarves fleeing from this disaster settled in Dunland, from\nwhere Thrór departed when he and his companion Nár journeyed\nto Moria in T.A. 2790. After the Battle of Azanulbizar, provoked by\nthe Orcs' brutal slaying of Thrór, Thráin II and Thorin led the remnants\nof their followers back to Dunland but soon left (to eventually settle\nin the Blue Mountains).\n\nWhen Gondor decided to give the depopulated province of Calenardhon to\nthe numerous people of Éothéod in TA 2510, the Hillfolk of the\nHithaeglir felt threatened by these _Forgoil_ “Strawheads” (a demeaning\nreference to the blonde hair of the refugees from Calenardhon). The\nHillfolk had slowly colonised Calenardhon during the dwindling of the\nDúnedain and had already reclaimed all the land between the Adorn and\nIsen. Still, open war was not waged until the reign of Helm Hammerhand\n(TA 2741 - TA 2759). Freca, the Lord of the Hillmen (whom the Rohirrim\nnow called Dunlendings) tried to get the throne of Rohan for himself by\npetitioning for the marriage of his son Wulf to the daughter of Helm.\nThe Hill-men leader Freca was killed and Wulf led the Dunlendings into\nopen war with Rohan. They unsuccessfully besieged the Hornburg during\nthe Long Winter of TA 2758 - TA 2759. Wulf did take Edoras and killed\nHaleth, the son of Helm, in front of the golden hall of Meduseld.\nNonetheless, Helm's nephew Fréalaf held out against the Dunlendings in\nthe refuge of Dunharrow. He recaptured Edoras at the end of the Long\nWinter and killed Wulf personally. The Dunlendings were driven out of\nRohan, and Fréalaf succeeded the deceased Helm Hammerhand.\n\nGuarding the Gap of Rohan was the fortress of Isengard, where a\nhereditary guard watched for Gondor. However, by the time of the Steward\nof Gondor Beren, these guards had mixed with Dunlendings, and it had\nbecome hostile to Gondor. To remedy this situation, Beren gave Saruman\nthe keys to Orthanc to guard Isengard for Gondor.\n\nSaruman used the historical hostility against outlanders to tempt the\nDunlendings into supporting him during the War of the Ring. In The Two\nTowers extended edition, the Dunlending warlord is shown giving a\nblood-oath to Saruman.\n\nAfter the battle at Helm's Deep, the Rohirrim allowed the surviving\nDunlendings to return to their homes. The Rohirrim required that all\nhostilities cease and that the Dunlendings again retreat behind the\nIsen.\n\n\nNearby locations\n\n-   North: Galanduin River\n-   East: Misty Mountains\n-   South: Isengard\n-   West: Enedwaith\n",

From Osgiliath the plague spread west and then north.

The White Tree was also\nthe motif of Gondor's flag.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThis iconic tree was in appearance a tall spacious tree of graceful\nform, white thin unwrinkled bark over white wood. In spring it bore\nnumerous white flowers, but few of these ever fructified; what shape the\nfruit was is never described, nor is it considered to be edible. The\nleaves were laurel-like, dark green above and bright silver beneath. The\nwood when burned gives off a dense, choking, volumnious smoke that forms\na fog capable of burying an entire country in darkness for several days.\n\nIt was fashioned in the image of Telperion, elder of the Two Trees of\nValinor, originally. This image was given to the Elves of Kortirion in\nValinor and named Galathilion. From it a sapling was taken to Tol\nEressëa, named Celeborn. This in turn sired the tree Nimloth of Númenor,\nfelled by Sauron and burned on the altars.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFirst White Tree\n\nThe first White Tree of Gondor came from a fruit that Isildur, at great\npersonal risk, managed to steal from Nimloth the Fair, the White Tree of\nNúmenor, before that one was destroyed at Sauron's insistence. He\nsuffered many wounds at this mission, and he came near death, but when\nthe first leaf opened in the spring, Isildur was healed of his wounds.\n\nThis sapling was brought to Middle-earth on Isildur's ship, and it was\neventually planted in Minas Ithil before the house of Isildur. But when\nSauron returned to Middle-earth, he launched a sudden attack that\ncaptured Minas Ithil, and he destroyed the White Tree. Isildur escaped\ntaking with him again a sapling.\n\nSecond White Tree\n\nIn the Year 2 of the Third Age, Isildur plants the seedling of the White\nTree in Minas Anor.\n\nThis White Tree lasts until TA 1636, when the Great Plague hits Gondor,\nkilling among many others King Telemnar and his children.\n\nThird White Tree\n\nA third sapling is planted in TA 1640 by King Tarondor. This one lasts\nuntil the year 2852 and the death of the Ruling Steward Belecthor II.\n\nAt this time no seedling of the tree could be found. As a result it was\nleft standing after its death.\n\nFourth White Tree\n\nWhen Aragorn becomes king he discovers (with Gandalf's help) a sapling\nof the White Tree upon the slopes of Mindolluin, high above the city,\nwhich he reverently plants in its place. The dead tree is removed from\nthe court but is placed in the Tombs of the Kings with all the honour\nthat would normally be accorded a fallen monarch. In June of TA 3019 the\nsapling blooms.\n"

The land was known in part for\nits cold and snowy weather.\n\n\nHistory\n\nLong before the Witch-king came to Angmar, the dwarves had many\nflourishing mines in the region, and halls that were secure and\nprosperous. It was not long before Durin's Folk felt the first assaults\nof Angmar. They fled southward, seeking the safety of their mines in the\nWeather Hills. \n\nThe Witch-king arose in Angmar during the realm of Malvegil of\nArthedain, at some time between TA 1272 and TA 1349. Men became aware of\nthe growing evil in the mountains, but Angmar was still preparing its\npower. No assaults on the Dunedain came until Argeleb I, the son of\nMalvegil, assumed the throne of Arthedain. \n\nIn TA 1356, the sub-realm Rhudaur was forced to invade Arthedain; many\nwere slaughtered including their king, Argeleb I. However, with the help\nof Cardolan's armies, Arthedain maintained a strong line of defense at\nthe foot of the Weather Hills. \n\n\n\nThen in TA 1409, Angmar attacked Cardolan and Rivendell and destroyed\nall the settlements within except Cardolan's capital, the Barrow-downs.\nAmon Sul was razed and burned and the Dunedain were forced to flee\nwestward. Arthedain was now left without any allies to aid it, and so\nbegan a mighty struggle lasting another 500 years.  \n\nHelp came from the Elves of the Grey Havens, Rivendell, and Lorien. The\narmies of Angmar were repelled from Fornost and the North Downs, and\nforced to withdraw to Angmar. The shadow of the North was contained for\na time.  \n\nAfter the Great Plague, which started from the east of Mordor in TA\n1636, the last of Cardolan's people died, allowing Barrow-wights to be\nsent from Angmar into the downs. \n\nDuring the time of TA 1974, Angmar multiplied its forces and launched a\nfinal assault on Arthedain. Subsequently, they took its capital Fornost,\nthereby defeating the last northern kingdom of the Dunedain.\n\nSometime later, Prince Eärnur - thirty-third and last King of Gondor -\narrived to aid Arthedain, but he found he was too late. His army\ndefeated the forces of Angmar in the Battle of Fornost, and the\nWitch-king fled to Mordor, leaving the kingdom of Angmar to fall in TA\n1975.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Angmar_ meant 'Iron home' in Sindarin.\n",

Some, however,\nremained in Estolad or fled south or east from the power of Dark Lord\nMorgoth, and passed from history until the Third Age. Despite their\nmighty heroes, the Edain were decimated by the hordes of Morgoth, but\none of their numbers, Eärendil of the House of Hador, sailed to Aman and\nobtained from the Valar the aid by which Morgoth was defeated in the\nLast Battle.

They remained loyal to the House of Finarfin,\nand later settled in the lands of Dorthonion.\n\n2.) The Second House, later known as the HALADIN or the HOUSE OF HALETH:\nThey were a reclusive folk, dark-haired but smaller in stature than the\nBëorians. They usually kept separate from the other Men, and were later\ngranted permission to settle in the Forest of Brethil, part of Doriath.\nThey mostly kept out of the wars.\n\n3.) The HOUSE OF MARACH, later best known as the HOUSE OF HADOR: They\nwere originally led by Marach but later took the name of Hador in honor\nof him. Tall and golden-haired, they most resembled the Vanyar of the\nelves. They were a very numerous and war-like tribe, and the Green Elves\nof Ossiriand feared them. They first settled in Estolad, then in the\nsouthern parts of Ered Wethrin (Mountains of Shadow), and then later in\nDor-lómin. They were loyal to Fingolfin.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nThe Edain were tall, fair, and strong; their spirits were noble, they\nwere fierce in war, and they shunned all dealings with evil. In\nBeleriand the Edain loved the Eldar, from whom they learned much wisdom,\nand they were further ennobled by the two marriages of Elda and Adan:\nBeren and Lúthien and Tuor and Idril. The lifespan of the Edain before\nthey entered Beleriand was probably about 70 years; in Beleriand, it was\nlengthened to 90, but few of the Edain lived to old age in peace.\n\n\nLanguage\n\nThe language of the Edain (at least those of the First and Third Houses)\nwas related to Adûnaic, but in Beleriand, most of the Edain spoke\nSindarin, and so the tongue of the Haladin was alien to them.\n\n\nFate of the Edain\n\nThe House of Bëor was nearly wiped out by Morgoth, and the remainder of\nits people merged with the Hadorians and became the Númenóreans. It\nwould seem that the Haladin of Beleriand were completely wiped out, or\nat least disappeared as a separate people.\n\nWhen they returned as Númenóreans to Middle-earth in the Second Age,\nthey encountered many men who were obviously related to the Atani: they\nclassified these men as _Middle Men_, and established friendly relations\nwith them. Examples are the Rohirrim, the Men of Dale, and the\nBreelanders.\n\nOther men, such as the Dunlendings, were not recognised as Middle Men\nbecause they were related to the Haladin rather than Bëorians or\nMarachians, and they were hostile to Númenor.\n\nA fourth kind of men came with the Second House, and called themselves\n_Drughu_. This name was adopted in Sindarin as _Drúedain_:\n_Drû_+_Edain_. They were a strange people, living with the Haladin in\nthe forest of Brethil, some even apparently made it to Númenor, but they\ndied out or had left before the Akallabêth. In the Third Age, their far\nkin were known as the _Woses_ of the Drúadan Forest. They had dwindled\nto a very small number and were secretive but were renowned for the\nassistance they gave to the Rohirrim in the War of the Ring.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe Sindarin word _Edain_, singular _Adan_ (Quenya _Atani_, _Atan_),\nliterally meant _Second People_, and originally referred to all men, but\nlater it only applied to the Men of Beleriand and their descendants. The\nQuenya term _Atani_ kept its old meaning."

    "text": "CARDOLAN was sub-kingdom of the Dúnedain Kingdom of Arnor. After the\ndeath of its tenth King, Eärendur, his sons had divided Arnor into the\nkingdoms of Arthedain, Rhudaur and Cardolan.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe borders of Cardolan extended from the river Brandywine to the west,\nthe river Hoarwell  to the east and the river Gwathló\n(Greyflood) to the east and south. Its northern border was the Great\nEast Road, but Cardolan also claimed the Arthedain-controlled Weather\nHills, which contained the fortress of Weathertop and its valuable\nPalantír. For this reason the Weather Hills were claimed by all three\nkingdoms - Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur. This territorial dispute\ncontinued until Rhudaur became a vassal of Angmar after the line of the\nDúnedain kings failed there.\n\nWhen the kingdom of Angmar arose in northern Eriador, Cardolan became\nthe most important ally of Arthedain. It had to fight the combined\narmies of both Angmar and Rhudaur. It soon became apparent that Cardolan\ncould not hold back the forces of Angmar and in its last years the\npeople became entrenched in the hill region, Tyrn Gorthad (the\nBarrowdowns). This position became untenable after Angmar sent evil\nspirits to inhabit the downs (the Barrow-wights). Arthedain could\nprovide little aid, as it was itself under attack. Around TA 1409\nCardolan was destroyed, and its former inhabitants accepted the King of\nArthedain as their lord. Arthedain managed to reconquer the land\nbriefly, but few people wished to live there on account of the\nBarrow-wights, and so Cardolan was never re-populated. \n\nAfter the final fall of Arnor, and the destruction of Angmar at the\nBattle of Fornost, Cardolan remained an unpopulated area until the\nreestablishment of the northern kingdom under King Aragorn II Elessar at\nthe end of the Third Age. Until then, the region was largely\nunclaimed and known as Minhiriath.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Cardolan_ appears to be a dialect Sindarin word for 'Red Hill\nLand'.",

Amlaith, the\ntrue heir to the throne of Arnor, was opposed by his two brothers.\nUnable to resolve the situation, he was reduced to ruling the region of\nArthedain, which consisted approximately of the lands west of the\nBrandywine River and north of the Great East Road. (His brothers created\nthe kingdoms of Cardolan and Rhudaur to the south.)\n\nThe kingdom's capital was at Fornost, and Bree was one of its most\nimportant towns. Annúminas was in the territory of Arthedain, but mostly\nabandoned and falling into ruin.\n\nIn TA 1300 the kingdom of Angmar appeared at Arthedain's north-eastern\nborder. Its King was the chief of the Ringwraiths, although this was not\nknown to the Dúnedain. When this new threat came Cardolan placed itself\nunder the suzerainty of Arthedain, which then began to call itself ARNOR\nagain. Cardolan repeatedly sent aid to Arthedain when needed but by TA\n1409 Cardolan and Rhudaur were conquered by Angmar.\n\nArthedain kept up the resistance against Angmar for over 500 years but\nin TA 1974 Arthedain was overrun and Fornost fell into the hands of\nAngmar. It fell just one year too soon for help was underway from Gondor\nunder the lead of Eärnur.

The\nkings of Arthedain were also the lords of The Shire and the Shire chose\nthe Thain to replace the kings.\n\nThe son of Arvedui, Aranarth decided not to rebuild the kingdom and so\nbecame the first Chieftain of the Dúnedain.

    "text": "THE SHIRE is subdivided into several regions.\n\n\nFarthings\n\nThe original parts of the Shire were subdivided into four FARTHINGS\n(“fourth-ings” or “quarterings”): the Three-Farthing stone marked the\npoint where the borders of the Eastfarthing, Westfarthing and\nSouthfarthing of the Shire came together, by the Great East Road.\n\nThe Northfarthing\n\nThe Northfarthing is the least populated part of the Shire. This was the\nsite of the historic Battle of Greenfields.\n\n-   LONG CLEEVE was the home of the small part of the Took clan known as\n    the _North-Tooks_, descendants of Bandobras “Bullroarer” Took, who\n    settled here after the Battle of Greenfields.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The village of HARDBOTTLE was the home to the Bracegirdle family of\n    Hobbits, to whom Lobelia Sackville-Baggins belonged. Some maps\n    erroneously place Hardbottle in the Southfarthing.\n\nThe Westfarthing\n\nThe western and most populated part of the Shire, this is the site of\nthe towns Michel Delving, Tuckborough (part of Took-land), and Hobbiton.\n\n-   MICHEL DELVING is the chief town of the Shire, located in the White\n    Downs. Its name means simply “large excavation”.\n\n        The Mayor of Michel Delving is the only elected official of The\n        Shire, elected on a seven year term.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   HOBBITON is the village where Bag End is located. This is the home\n    of Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins and the site of the beginning and\n    conclusion of the novels _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_.\n    Sam Gamgee and his grandfather, the “Gaffer”, live on the lane of\n    _Bagshot Row_, below Bag End.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Bywater is a village a short walk east of Hobbiton. It is best known\n    as the home of two inns, The Green Dragon Inn and The Ivy Bush.\n\nThe Southfarthing\n\nA rural and fertile area, the Southfarthing is the site of the towns\nGamwich (original home of the Gamgee family), Cotton, Longbottom and\nmuch pipe-weed production.\n\n-   LONGBOTTOM, a name meaning “long valley”, was founded by Tobold\n    Hornblower with the introduction of pipe-weed, in TA 2670, allowing\n    the region to become well established due to the success of the\n    pipe-weed industry.\n\nThe Eastfarthing\n\nBorders on Buckland, contains the towns Frogmorton and Whitfurrows and\nthe farms of the Marish. Originally, the Eastfarthing was under the\ncontrol of the Oldbuck family. Even after these became the Brandybucks,\nthe farmers of the Eastfarthing followed the Brandybucks rather than the\nThain and Mayor.\n\n-   THE YALE is the name of the low-lying lands of the Shire's\n    Eastfarthing that lay along the northern side of the long road from\n    Stock westwards to Tuckborough. This seems to have been a sparsely\n    populated area, and in fact the map of the Shire in _The Lord of the\n    Rings_ marks only a single building here.\n    -   The meaning of the Yale's name is obscure. The well-known\n        English personal and placename “Yale” has its origins in a Welsh\n        expression meaning “fertile upland.” Its use may suggest that\n        the Hobbits who named it had contacts with “strange” languages,\n        possibly those of Dunland.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   THE MARISH is the name of fertile, yet boggy farmlands located in\n    the Shire's Eastfarthing. It is where the Oldbuck family is believed\n    to have lived before Gorhendad Oldbuck removed the family across the\n    Brandywine to Buckland and changed their name\n\n\nOther parts of the Shire\n\nThe Buckland and Westmarch are sometimes reckoned part of the Shire,\nthough they are not part of any Farthing. Buckland was described in\nChapter V _A conspiracy unmasked_ in Fellowship of the Ring as being\n_“virtually a small independent country.. a sort of colony of the\nShire.”_ Westmarch became part of the Shire only after the end of the\nevents portrayed in Lord of the Rings, in the fourth age.\n\nBuckland\n\nLocation, villages and borders\n\nBuckland is located east of the Baranduin (Brandywine) river. The\nhobbits living in Buckland grew the High Hay, a hedge, to protect\nthemselves against evil from the nearby Old Forest, which borders\nBuckland to the east. Buckland is bordered in the north by the Hay Gate,\nthe only entrance to Buckland near the Brandywine Bridge. In the south\nthe borders of Buckland follow the High Hay until the Withywindle joins\nthe Baranduin near the village of Haysend. The most important town of\nBuckland is _BUCKLEBURY_ where the Brandy Hall is located, home of the\nMaster of Buckland, one of the important officials of the Shire.\n\nAn important landmark is the _BUCKLEBURY FERRY_, a raft-ferry used as\nthe second main crossing point of the Brandywine River from the Shire to\nBuckland, after the Brandywine Bridge (which is twenty miles further\nsouth). It is apparently left unmanned to be used by hobbit travellers\nas needed. En route to the new house at Crickhollow, Frodo, Sam, Merry\nand Pippin crossed using the Ferry just before the arrival of a Black\nRider, who was forced to go around to the Brandywine Bridge as there\nwere no boats kept on the western bank of the river.\n\nHistory and Culture\n\nBuckland was settled around TA 2340 by Gorhenhad Oldbuck, the ancestor\nof Meriadoc Brandybuck. Gorhenhad Oldbuck thus became the first Master\nof Buckland. He renamed himself Brandybuck, which remained his family's\nname.\n\nBecause Buckland is east of the Baranduin it isn't part of the land\ngiven to the Hobbits by King Argeleb II of Arthedain. It was thus not\npart of the Shire proper until the beginning of the Fourth Age when King\nElessar made Buckland and the Westmarch officially a part of the Shire.\n\nThe Bucklanders are unlike other hobbits as they are prepared for danger\nand are thus less naive than the Shire-hobbits. They close the Hay Gate\nand their own front doors at night and are prepared to rush to arms when\nthe Horn of Buckland is blown. Most Bucklanders were originally of Stoor\nstock, and they were the only Hobbits known to use boats.\n\nThe Westmarch\n\nAfter the events of the War of the Ring at the start of the Fourth Age\nof Middle-earth, King Aragorn Elessar granted the Hobbits of the Shire\neffective self-rule inside his Reunited Kingdom, banning any men from\nentering the land.\n\nHe also granted the Shire a stretch of new land: this reached from the\nancient western borders of the Shire, the White Downs, to the Tower\nHills.\n\nThe area between the downs and the hills became known as the WESTMARCH.\n\nThe eldest daughter of mayor Samwise Gamgee, Elanor the Fair, married\nFastred of Greenholm, and they moved to the Westmarch. After the passing\nof master Samwise, they and their children became known as the\n_Fairbairns of the Towers_ or _Wardens of Westmarch_, and the Red Book\nof Frodo and Bilbo Baggins passed into their keeping, becoming known as\nthe _Red Book of Westmarch_.\n\nGovernmentally, the Westmarch was a region of itself, and like Buckland\nacross the river Brandywine it was not part of any of the four Farthings\nof the Shire.\n\n Category:The Shire"

    "text": "RHUDAUR was the smallest of the kingdoms that originated from the\nbreak-up of Arnor in TA 861. The other kingdoms were Arthedain and\nCardolan.\n\n\nHistory\n\nRhudaur formed the eastern part of Arnor, and stretched from the Weather\nHills with Weathertop to the river Loudwater. It shared a long border\nwith Cardolan along the Great East Road, and with Arthedain along the\nline of the Weather Hills.\n\nThe land between the rivers Hoarwell and Loudwater was also considered\npart of Rhudaur. It was called _the Angle_, and it is here that the\nfirst Stoor Hobbits came into Eriador around TA 1150. However, due to\nthe increasing hostility of Angmar these Stoors fled the region around\nTA 1356, with some of them moving west to the Shire, and others moving\nback to Wilderland.\n\n\n\nFrom the start of its existence, Rhudaur was unfriendly towards the two\nother successor states, and took part in a bitter conflict with\nArthedain over the Tower of Amon Sûl and the Palantír associated with\nthe tower.\n\n\n\nThe last Kings of Rhudaur were not of Númenórean blood, but were\ndescended of Men in service of Angmar. Under their rule the land became\na vassal of Angmar, and thus enemies of Cardolan and Arthedain.\n\nAngmar annexed and terminated the kingdom in TA 1409. By this time, the\nDúnedain were gone from the region, as well as most of the other\ninhabitants.\n\nThere is evidence that after the fall of Angmar at the Battle of Fornost\nthe Angle became home to the remainder of the Dúnedain, and the Rangers\nof the North established several villages there, where their people\nlived until the resurrection of the northern Kingdom under King Aragorn\nII Elessar at the end of the Third Age.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe _Haeranedain_ (S.“Far Wandering Edain”) were Rhudaurians of\nNúmenorean descent, most were actually mix-blooded Tergil. Most\nRhudaurian Dúnedain belonged to one of seven greater Noble Houses of\nHiri, House Amrothar, House Eldanar, House Enedil, House Melosse, House\nMithlad, House Rhudainor and House Rómentir.\n\nThe name Rhudaur appears to be dialect Sindarin for 'East Forests',\n\nThe _Rhudaurians_ (S.“Rhudaurim”) were the inhabitants of the fallen\nkingdom of Rhudaur, in the closer sense those of númenorean blood, the\nHaeranedain, in a wider sense all those eriadorian tribes living inside\nthe borders of Rhudaur including:\n\n-   the Hillmen of the Trollshaws and Coldfells\n-   the Vulseggi or northrons of the Egladil\n-   the Dunmen of the southern borderlands to Eregion and Cardolan\n-   the Forodrim of the Northern marches\n\n\nAppearance\n\nThe Haeranedain were a bit smaller and darker than the high Dúnedain,\nalthough 6 ft for men was not uncommon.\n\nIn daily life most had adapted clothes much similar to those of the\nindigenous Hillmen, the _Kailth_, a skirt or kilt, and the _Kullodoo_.",

Beren was\nnow the last person of the house of Bëor but in the Second Age some\nfamilies of Númenor still spoke Adûnaic with a notable Bëorian accent.\n\nFurthermore, the majority of faithful were those of Bëorian descent.\nThis was because the majority of the Men of Bëor had settled in the\nwestern part of Númenor, which later became the area controlled by the\nfaithful Lords of Andúnië. Traits of the House of Bëor were passed down\nto the Dúnedain of the Middle-earth and can be seen in Aragorn II\nElessar's physical description: lean, dark and tall, with “a shaggy head\nof dark hair flecked with grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keen\ngrey eyes.”\n\n\nNotable members\n\n-   BËOR THE OLD, originally named Balan and later given the title _the\n    Old_, was leader of the House of Bëor, the first men to travel into\n    Beleriand. He met Finrod Felagund, who guided them to settle in\n    Estolad, east of Doriath. Bëor took service with Finrod in\n    Nargothrond. His name _Bëor_ meant _vassal_ in the Bëorian tongue.\n    He got his title, _the Old_, because he died at 93 years of age, of\n    which 44 were spent serving Finrod.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BARAN was the eldest son of Bëor the Old and took up the leadership\n    of the House of Bëor when his father departed to Nargothrond. He\n    dwelt in Estolad and had two sons, BORON and BARANOR.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BEREG, a grandson of Baran, was dissatisfied with Estolad, and led\n    part of the people away to parts unknown, disappearing from the\n    histories. It is possible some of his descendants were the ancestors\n    of the later Men of Eriador.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BOROMIR was a son of Boron. The later Boromir of Gondor was named\n    after him. Boromir was granted the land of Ladros in Dorthonion as a\n    fief, and his house removed there.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BREGOR was a son of Boromir and Andreth was Boromir's daughter.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BREGOLAS, who died in the Dagor Bragollach, and BARAHIR were sons of\n    Bregor.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BEREN was a son of Barahir, perhaps the greatest hero of the First\n    Age. He and Luthíen went to Morgoth and successfully cut a Silmaril\n    from his crown.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BARAGUND was a son of Bregolas and a direct descendant of Bëor the\n    Old. He had one daughter, Morwen, and he was the grandfather of\n    Túrin Turambar. He survived the Dagor Bragollach and lived as an\n    outlaw with his uncle Barahir and some companions. They were\n    eventually betrayed by Sauron and killed."

    "text": "NARGOTHROND (Sindarin IPA: ) was the Elven stronghold built by Finrod\nFelagund, delved into the banks of the river Narog in Beleriand during\nthe First Age.\n\n\nDescription\n\nSimilar to the structures of many underground Dwarven cities,\nNargothrond consisted of many miles of caves and tunnels of various\nshapes and sizes carved through the rock, which was possibly limestone.\nThere were three Great Halls centered around the other tunnels and\ncaves, where the Lord of the city no doubt sat. The deepest of the caves\nwas the Innermost Chamber where Glaurung later hoarded up the remaining\ntreasures of Nargothrond and sat upon them until he left. Lúthien lived\nin a southwestern cave chamber during her stay there. The realms\narmouries were in several chambers south of the Great Halls. The main\nentrance through the Doors of Felagund to Nargothrond facing river Narog\none came into a large chamber, which was about five-hundred feet from\nthe Great Halls of Felagund.\n\n\nHistory\n\nYears of Peace\n\nInspired by Menegroth in Doriath, and seeking a hidden place from which\nto be safe from the forces of Morgoth, Finrod established it in the\nearly years following the return of the Ñoldor to Middle-earth, in the\nCaverns of Narog beneath the forested hills of TAUR-EN-FAROTH on the\nwestern bank of Narog. He was aided by the Dwarves of Nogrod who also\nmade for him the Nauglamír, the Necklace of the Dwarves.\n\nHowever, Finrod was not the first to delve in those caves: it had first\nbeen inhabited by the Petty-dwarves, who called it NULUKKIZDÎN (Khuzdul\nIPA: ) before they were driven out. Originally, a narrow path along the\nbanks of the river could only reach it, but later a bridge was built\nacross the Narog.\n\nFinrod ruled Nargothrond until he joined Beren in his Quest for the\nSilmaril, being succeeded by his nephew Orodreth. However, the Sons of\nFëanor, Celegorm and Curufin lived in Nargothrond at this time and\ncarried a great influence with its people, sowing fear and distrust of\noutsiders. After Finrod's death was reported they were exiled in\ndisgrace.\n\nFall of Nargothrond\n\n[Túrin and Glaurung, by woutart \n\nSince its foundation by Finrod, the Elves of Nargothrond had pursued a\nsecretive war against Morgoth, hunting his forces by stealth and ambush\nrather than going to open war. When Túrin was led there by Gwindor,\nhowever, he grew high in the esteem of Orodreth, Lord of Nargothrond,\nand counseled a different strategy.\n\nTúrin Turambar became one of the chief captains, persuading the people\nto abandon their long standing policy and instead fight openly against\nMorgoth.\n\nTúrin persuaded Orodreth to build the Bridge of Nargothrond to allow\nspeedy passage of forces into the field. Orodreth built the bridge from\nhis doors across the Narog, and went to open war with Morgoth. In\ncenturies of searching, Morgoth had been unable to find the fortress of\nNargothrond, but now not only was its location revealed, but the new\nbridge removed the defence of the River Narog. Glaurung the dragon was\nsent out from Angband with an army of Orcs to capture the city. After\nthe defeat of the army of Nargothrond at the field of Tumhalad in FA\n495, Glaurung and his army of Orcs came south, crossed the bridge, and\nsacked the city, killing or selling some of the inhabitants into\nslavery. The survivors, then went to seek refuge in Doriath, and that's\nhow Thingol knew of the fall of Nargothrond.\n\nGlaurung remained there until FA 499 when he went northeast to Brethil,\nto confront Túrin Turambar who eventually slew him. Though the realm was\nno more, Mîm the Petty-dwarf took up residence in caves claiming it and\nits treasures as his own in payment for the sufferings of his people,\nuntil Húrin came and slew him for his betrayal of his son. The treasure,\nincluding the Nauglamír, was then brought to the Elven Kingdom of\nDoriath and given to King Thingol. Afterwards, the caves were\ndestroyed during the War of Wrath, along with all of Beleriand.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_NARGOTHROND_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Narog-fortress-vaulted\nhall'.",

In the north, it rose gradually\nfrom the plains, with great pine forests. The Ered Gorgoroth formed the\nsouthern boundary of Dorthonion, bending to the north on the east side\nto create the PASS OF AGLON between Dorthonion and Hills of Himring. To\nthe south and west of Dorthonion were the Echoriath, which surrounded\nthe hidden kingdom of Gondolin. The upper reaches of the River Sirion\npassed between the western slopes of Dorthonion and the Ered\nWethrin.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDorthonion was originally ruled by Angrod and Aegnor, sons of Finarfin,\nbut it was overrun by Morgoth in the Dagor Bragollach, after which it\nwas known as Taur-nu-Fuin which translates as _Forest under Night_ or\n_The Forest under the Shadow of the Night_.\n\nThe northeastern slopes of Dorthonion were known as Ladros, a fief given\nto Boromir of the House of Bëor. Here Barahir and a small band of\noutlaws dwelt until they were all slain at Tarn Aeluin by Orcs sent by\nSauron save for Beren, Barahir's son in FA 460. Beren dwelt alone in the\nwilderness of Dorthonion for a time until he left for Doriath and met\nLúthien.\n\nAlong with the other lands west of the Blue Mountains, Taur-nu-Fuin was\nmostly destroyed in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age.\nAfterwards, its highest points survived as the island TOL FUIN (Isle of\nNight), part of the WESTERN ISLES.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_DORTHONION_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'land of pines'."

Although it was colonized by\nShire-hobbits, it was not formally a part of the Shire until early in\nthe Fourth Age, hundreds of years after it was founded.\n\n\nLocation, Villages and Borders\n\nBuckland is located east of the Brandywine river. The hobbits living in\nBuckland grew the High Hay, a hedge, to protect themselves against any\nevil from the nearby Old Forest, which borders Buckland to the east.\nBuckland is bordered in the north by the Hay Gate, the only entrance to\nBuckland near the Brandywine Bridge. In the south, the borders of\nBuckland follow the High Hay until the Withywindle joins the Brandywine\nnear the village of Haysend. The most important town of Buckland is\n_BUCKLEBURY_ where Brandy Hall is located, home of the Master of\nBuckland, one of the important officials of the Shire.\n\nAn important landmark is the _BUCKLEBURY FERRY_, a raft-ferry used as\nthe second main crossing point of the Brandwine river from the Shire to\nBuckland, after the Brandywine Bridge (which is twenty miles further\nnorth). It is apparently left unmanned to be used by hobbit travellers\nas needed. En route to the new house at Crickhollow, Frodo Baggins, Sam\nGamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took crossed using the Ferry\njust before the arrival of a Black Rider, who was forced to go around to\nthe Brandywine Bridge as there were no boats kept on the western bank of\nthe river. \n\n\nHistory\n\nBuckland was settled around TA 2340 (SR 740) by Gorhendad Oldbuck, the\nancestor of Meriadoc Brandybuck. Gorhenhad Oldbuck thus became the first\nMaster of Buckland. He renamed himself Brandybuck, which remained his\nfamily's name.\n\nBecause Buckland is east of the Brandywine, it isn't part of the land\ngiven to the Hobbits by King Argeleb II of Arthedain. It was thus not\npart of the Shire proper until the beginning of the Fourth Age when King\nElessar made Buckland, now renamed the EASTMARCH, and the Westmarch\nofficial parts of the Shire.\n\n\nCulture\n\nThe Bucklanders are unlike other hobbits as they are prepared for danger\nand are thus less naive than the Shire-hobbits. They close the Hay Gate\nand their own front doors at night and are prepared to rush to arms when\nthe Horn of Buckland is blown. Most Bucklanders were originally of Stoor\nstock, and they were the only Hobbits known to use boats."

Translated into English, it reads, “_Sting_ is my name; I am the\nspider's bane.” The Appendix of ''The Silmarillion _defines_ _the\nelement _maeg'' in Sindarin as meaning “sharp” or “piercing”. During the\nThird Age, it was wielded by Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins, and Samwise\nGamgee.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nSting was an ancient Elvish blade made by weapon-smiths in Gondolin.\nWhen Orcs or goblins were within an undetermined radius of it, the blade\nglowed blue, alerting the wielder and others who could see it to their\npresence. It had been lost during the Fall of Gondolin, the same battle\nin which Turgon fell and Glamdring was taken. It appeared as a curved\nblade with a silver loop or spiral design on it, later runes were added\nto it by Bilbo after his adventures. These runes seem to have been made\nby the Elves as they are in Sindarin.\n\nIn _The Hobbit_, Bilbo and his dwarven companions found Sting in a\nTroll-hoard alongside two other elven blades: Glamdring and Orcrist.\nThough just a dagger by the standard of elves, Sting made a perfect\nshort sword for a Hobbit, although it was still rather small, as Bilbo\ninitially chose to wear it “inside his breeches” and was still able\nto travel and even run without any apparent inconvenience.\n\nJust before his nephew embarked on his quest to Mordor from Rivendell,\nBilbo gave Sting to Frodo. Sam then took the weapon from his (seemingly\ndead) master and used it to good effect against Shelob on the borders of\nMordor. After the defeat of Sauron at the end of the Third Age, Frodo\nentrusted Sting to Sam and it became an heirloom of the Gamgee family.\n\nGollum, who disliked anything made by the Elves, was afraid of Sting.\nThis fear aided Bilbo when he confronted Gollum in the Cave at the base\nof the Misty Mountains in _The Hobbit_. It also helped Frodo and Sam\nsubdue Gollum in _The Lord of the Rings_. Orcs also had an instinctive\nfear of these weapons and hated any who carried them.\n\nAs is fitting for a blade of Gondolin, Sting could easily cut through\nthe webs of the offspring of Ungoliant, including the evil Shelob and\nthe spiders of Mirkwood. Bilbo had named the weapon _Sting_ after he had\n“stung” one of them with it. In The Hobbit when Bilbo wears the One\nRing, and defends himself against a spider, he names the blade “Sting”.\nThe narrator describes the spider's lack of acquaintance with creatures\nwith such stings, and evidently this was also Bilbo's presumption in\nnaming it as such. Sting was like Glamdring and Orcrist in that “being\nthe work of Elvish smiths in the Elder Days these swords shone with a\ncold light, if any Orcs were near at hand.” But only Sting was\ndefinitively described as glowing blue, or glittering with blue flame at\nits edges.\n",

    "text": "The BATTLE OF THE BLACK GATE, also known as the BATTLE OF THE\nMORANNON, was the final major battle of the War of the Ring. It resulted\nin the ultimate defeat of Sauron not by victory on the battlefield, but\nby means of the destruction of the One Ring by the hobbit Frodo.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nAfter the victory of the Free Peoples in the Battle of the Pelennor\nFields, the enemy retreated to Mordor. Sauron was defeated but he still\nhad thousands of Orcs at his disposal in Mordor. He was aware that the\nOne Ring was somewhat close to the vicinity of his territory, but he did\nnot know that the Hobbit Frodo Baggins and his companion Samwise Gamgee\nhad entered Mordor via Morgul Vale with the intention of destroying the\nRing.\n\nPlot against the Dark Lord\n\nAfter the Last Debate, the Men of the West assembled the Host of the\nWest, 10,000 strong, led by Aragorn, who marched on the Black Gate as a\ndiversionary feint to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo and Sam,\nwho were carrying the One Ring through Mordor to be destroyed in the\nfires of Mount Doom. It was hoped that Sauron would think Aragorn had\nthe Ring and was now trying to use it to overthrow him in Mordor.\n\n\n\nMustering\n\nInitially, the Host of the West consisted of 10,000 men, but 3,000\nRohirrim were sent to guard the crossroads, leaving Aragorn with 7,000\nmen. Before they reached Ithilien they were ambushed by Haradrim and\nEasterlings, but they drove them away easily with no casualties.\n\nThen, as they approached Dagorlad, some of the farmers of Lossarnach and\nRohan were too afraid to continue to pass the Desolation of the\nMorannon. Aragorn dismissed the faint-hearted, ordering them to liberate\nCair Andros on the river Anduin. This resulted in the departure of an\nestimated 1000 men, leaving Aragorn with 6,000.\n\nParley with the Dark Lieutenant\n\nBefore the battle began, the Black Gate opened slightly, letting out a\nsmall embassy. At the head was a high servant of Sauron, a Black\nNúmenórean called the Mouth of Sauron, who had been ordered to speak\nwith the Captains of the West. He reasoned that the Army of the West\ncould not defeat Sauron's host on the battlefield, and demanded the Army\nsurrender. The Lieutenant then brought forth several items that had\nbelonged to Frodo and Sam (Sam's sword, an Elven cloak, and Frodo's\nMithril shirt). Gandalf asked for the terms of their surrender, which\nwere to allow Sauron dominion over Isengard and Rohan, as well as\nGondor's vassalage. Gandalf vehemently refused.\n\nRealizing the Army intended to fight and being outnumbered, fear and\nanger overcame the Lieutenant, and he retreated to the Morannon, which\nthen opened to reveal a massive army of Sauron's forces. Thousands of\nOrcs also emerged from the hillsides around the Morannon. In the film\nAragorn, not believing what happened to Frodo, beheads The Mouth of\nSauron.\n\nThe Battle\n\nAgainst the Host of the West was arrayed a large hordes of Orcs, Trolls,\nand Mannish allies such as the Easterlings and Haradrim. An exact count\nis not given of the number of Sauron's forces, but it is said that they\nwere “ten times and more than ten times” greater than the Host of the\nWest, making it a force of at least 60,000. Sauron's forces surrounded\nthe Armies of the West on three sides, with the Easterlings on the left\nflank, the Orcs held the center, and the Haradrim on the right.\nInitially, Sauron's forces found difficulty in getting to the Army of\nthe West, due to the large slag pools and pits of waste surrounding\nparts of the Morannon, which impeded their progress. The Armies of the\nWest always had cohesive stability within their center and kept the\nEnemy from breaking through by force of numbers. The solid infantry\nsquares of Gondor infantry beat off their inferior Orcish opponents\nwhile the Rohirrim cavalrymen staved off the archers of the Harad. The\nsmall force of Easterlings launched a quick attack before being repulsed\nby the armies of Gondor and Rohirrim while the larger Haradrim force\nslowly retreated to the hills. By now, pressure had eased off of the\nflanks of the Armies of the West, who smashed into the lines of the\nOrc-host, slowly beating them off and forcing a retreat back through the\nBlack Gate (though not without suffering sizable losses of their own).\n\n\n\nDuring the course of the battle, the remaining eight Nazgûl emerged and\nattacked the Army of the West. Shortly thereafter, however, the Great\nEagles of the Misty Mountains, led by Gwaihir the Windlord, arrived and\nattacked the Ringwraiths, preventing them from pressing their aerial\nadvantage. Trolls began to crash through the lines of infantry, and the\nOrcs and Easterlings made renewed assaults on the Army of the West,\nencircling it. Many of the soldiers of the West began to become\ndistraught. That was when Frodo put on the One Ring and Sauron realized\nthat Frodo and the Ring were inside Mount Doom.\n\nThe Fall of Barad-dûr and Sauron\n\nThe Nazgûl immediately left the battle to intercept Frodo. Before they\ncould get there however, Gollum bit the Ring off Frodo's finger and\ndanced with joy accidentally falling into the Crack of Doom, destroying\nthe Ring, and Sauron's power was overthrown.\n\n\n\nBarad-dûr, the Black Gate, and the Towers of the Teeth collapsed to\nruin. The Orcs and other creatures of Sauron were completely\ndirectionless with the Dark Lord's demise and were easily defeated and\ndestroyed by the remaining troops of the Host of the West. Some of the\nEasterlings and Haradrim fought on stalwartly, though eventually many\nthrew down their weapons and surrendered (later to be sent home in peace\nby Aragorn).\n\nThe Rest of the Battle\n\nDespite the destruction of Mordor and its armies, the fight against\nSauron's remaining forces would continue in the northern theater of the\nWar of the Ring for several weeks, notably at Dol Guldur in Mirkwood and\nat The Lonely Mountain, but the power of Sauron, the Dark Lord of\nMordor, was no more.\n\nMonths later, the Battle of Bywater in the Shire against Ruffians men\nled by Saruman, and the subsequent killing of Saruman by Wormtongue who\nthen was later slain, ended the War of the Ring.\n",

    "text": "The BATTLE OF OSGILIATH was a battle during the War of the Ring at the\nruined city of Osgiliath - and a prelude to the Battle of the Pelennor\nFields.\n\n\nHistory\n\nPrelude\n\nPrior to this, Sauron had regained all his military strength and was\nprepared to attack Middle-earth. He first planned to attack his most\npowerful enemy, the land of Gondor, where “the hammer stroke will fall\nhardest”, but in order to destroy Gondor's capital, Minas Tirith, he\nfirst needed to capture Osgiliath, a ruined fortress-city strategically\npositioned on the river. Fords across the river were located in\nOsgiliath (half of the city was located on each side of the river) that\nwere the only path a large army could cross the Anduin for hundreds of\nmiles up or downstream (from Cair Andros to Pelargir). If captured,\nSauron could freely move his main army across the river and to the\nprimary target of his strategy in the war, Minas Tirith.\n\nThe Battle\n\nThe battle to control the ruins of Osgiliath had actually been fought,\non and off, for over a century since the fall of Ithilien to Mordor. A\nrenewed offensive by Mordor to take the city had begun several years\nprior to the Quest of Mount Doom (several years before TA 3018), and was\nfought continuously after that point with occasional lulls. The forces\nof Gondor, led by their captain-general Boromir, engaged in fierce urban\nwarfare during this long siege. Under Boromir's command the enemy was\npushed out of the half of the city on the west bank of the river, and on\na strike force including Boromir and his younger brother Faramir was\nable to destroy the last bridge in the city that connected the two banks\nof the river. This prevented Mordor's army from making an easy crossing,\nalthough the fords remained. Sauron not sending more troops to\nOsgiliath, but instead massing them within Mordor for a killing-blow\nmonths later probably caused this lull in the Mordor-offensive. During\nthis break in heavy fighting, Boromir left Gondor to seek counsel at\nRivendell; he would never return.\n\nDuring this time, Faramir led several Ranger attacks deep into\nMordor-occupied Ithilien, ambushing enemy armies moving to the Black\nGate; Frodo and Sam stumbled into one such attack, as told in _The Two\nTowers._\n\nWhen the Great Signal from Mordor went up and another answered from\nMinas Morgul, the War of the Ring properly began, even though Isengard\nhad been fighting before this and Sauron had been pursuing his other\nfronts. Thus, the Battle of Osgiliath was the first battle of the war in\na strict sense.\n\nWhile there were men defending the west side of Osgiliath, the Steward\nDenethor ordered Faramir to lead a force to reinforce them. Faramir\nregarded the order ill advised and certain to result in death, but\ncomplied.\n\nHowever, Mordor was prepared. Months beforehand, the Orcs in East\nOsgiliath had been secretly constructing massive numbers of boats and\nrafts, and swelled with reinforcements from Harad they swarmed across\nthe River Anduin to the Gondor positions on the other bank. After long\nand heavy fighting, the garrison under Faramir and his troops were\nforced to flee back to Minas Tirith, behind the Rammas Echor. Faramir\nhimself was badly wounded in the retreat, when a poisoned Southron arrow\npierced him; more severe damage was done by the Black breath of the\nNazgûl. When the retreat was sure to be a disaster, the knights of the\nDol Amroth sortie led by Imrahil arrived; the pursuing hordes were\ndriven back and the garrison reached the city safely.\n\nIn the meantime, the Orcs made makeshift repairs to several destroyed\nbridges. The main combined army of Mordor then arrived, formed from\nthose that Frodo saw leaving Minas Morgul, but this was “but one and not\nthe greatest of the hosts that Mordor now sent forth”: for on their way\nfrom The Morgul Vale, the orcs the Minas Morgul cavalry led by the\nWitch-king of Angmar had been joined with the Haradrim from the south,\nand a far greater host that had massed at the Black Gate joined them at\nOsgiliath, and the combined forces now entered the western bank of\nOsgiliath. More also came from the fords at Cair Andros, which was\nrecently captured, but they would not reach Minas Tirith until later.\n\nAftermath\n\nOsigiliath now completely in the hands of Mordor, the vast army of\nSauron marched from the city and surrounded Minas Tirith, beginning the\nsiege of Gondor and leading directly into the Battle of the Pelennor\nFields.\n",

Attempts were made to hinder them with arrows, but\nthese only served to irritate the attackers further, and, in a matter of\nminutes the Gate and much of the Southern wall was reduced to ruin.\n\n\nThe Battle\n\nAs the Hobbits Merry and Pippin, who were present during the battle,\nlater recounted to their friends, Ents are so strong that their _punches\ncan crumple iron like tinfoil_, and they can _tear apart solid rock like\nbreadcrusts._ A ring of Huorns surrounded Isengard and killed all\nescaping Orcs.\n\nOnce the Gate and walls had been reduced to rubble, a young Ent named\nQuickbeam in the Westron tongue, spotted Saruman, and made for him,\nshouting 'The Tree Killer!', for his people and all Fangorn forest in\ngeneral had suffered from heavy deforestation to fuel the furnaces of\nSaruman. Other Ents followed him, but Saruman succeeded in escaping into\nthe tower of Orthanc. Once in the tower, he activated spouts and vents\nall over the plain, scorching many Ents who had entered the fortress.\nOne Ent, Beechbone, was unlucky enough to be caught fully in one of the\nfiery blasts, and the death of this Ent by Saruman's fire caused the Ent\nhost to go berserk. Merry and Pippin recounted the incident, saying that\nthe enraged roars of the Ents were enough to crack the stones. They\ndestroyed the buildings and machinery on the plain, but could do nothing\nto hurt the tower itself.\n\nAt this point, the Ents took counsel and came up with a new plan of\nattack. By digging trenches and destroying Saruman's dam, the Ents and\nHuorns were to divert the course of the river Isen itself. As the Ents\ndid work destroying the dam, Gandalf appeared to Treebeard and the\nhobbits during the night. Gandalf took counsel with Treebeard, resulting\nin the Huorns' involvement at the Battle of the Hornburg. At midnight,\nthe Ents succeeded in destroying the dam, and the river flooded the\n'bowl' of Isengard, submerging everything but the tower and filling in\nall the tunnels and holes where the machinery of war had been. The\ndestruction of Isengard was complete, although Saruman was still\nuntouched in the tower. Some men from Dunland surrendered and were\nallowed to leave.\n\nThe sound defeat of Saruman's hosts at the Battle of the Hornburg and\nthe destruction of his fortress rendered him incapable of causing the\nWest any further military harm, although he still had the power of his\npersuasive and commanding voice, with which he could still do (and did\ndo) harm. Had the Ents not destroyed Isengard, despite the destruction\nof Saruman's main army, he still could have withstood a siege with his\nfew remaining forces behind Isengard's normally impregnable walls,\nbiding his time until he could renew his strength.\n",

    "text": "BELEGOST was one of two Dwarven cities located in the Blue\nMountains during the First Age in Middle-earth.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBelegost was one of the seven great kingdoms of the Dwarves. With her\nsister realm, Nogrod, Belegost was dug deep beneath Mount Dolmed in the\nBlue Mountains in the Ages of Stars.\n\nAmongst the Dwarves of Belegost were the finest smiths and stone-carvers\nin Middle-earth. In their armourer's halls they made many bright weapons\nand were the first people to forge chain-mail. The Dwarves of Belegost\ntraded with the Sindar Elves of Beleriand and supplied them with weapons\nof incomparably tempered steel; furthermore these Dwarves carved the\nstone chambers of Menegroth. One of their payments for these services\nwas Nimphelos, a great pearl.\n\nIn the First Age, the Dwarves of Belegost and their lord, Azaghâl, won\ngreat fame in the War of the Jewels. In the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the\nDwarves alone could withstand the heat of the Dragon-fire because being\na race of smiths were used to great heat and on their helms they wore\nmasks of steel. Their axes too that they forged were strong enough to\nhold the Dragons in check. Though Azaghâl was slain, he wounded\nGlaurung, the Father of Dragons and the Dragon brood fled the\nbattleground, all the way back to Angband. The Dwarves of Belegost\nwere asked by the Dwarves of Nogrod for aid in their war against\nDoriath, but were refused.\n\nAt the end of the First Age, Belegost was ruined in the War of Wrath,\nand around the fortieth year of the Second Age, the Dwarves of the Blue\nMountains began to migrate to Khazad-dûm, abandoning Nogrod\nand Belegost.\n\n\nInhabitants\n\nIn the twelfth volume of _The History of Middle-earth_, _The Peoples of\nMiddle-earth_, an essay appears entitled _Of Dwarves and Men_ which\nsheds some light on the people of Belegost. Circumstantial evidence\ngiven there suggests that the Dwarves of Belegost were unrelated\nto Durin's Folk, the Longbeards that appear in Tolkien's better-known\nwork, and instead belonged to a different clan, either the Firebeards or\nthe Broadbeams. The word-order used there suggests that Belegost was\nfounded by the Broadbeams, while nearby Nogrod was populated by the\nFirebeard clan.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Belegost_ was a Sindarin word for “mighty or great fortress”. Its name\nin Westron was MICKLEBURG_, _ and the Khuzdul name for it was\nGABILGATHOL.",

Durin was set to sleep alone\nbeneath Mount Gundabad in Middle-earth until the Elves awoke. The name\nDurin, like other names of Tolkien's Dwarves, was taken from Old Norse.\nIn Tolkien's fiction, Dalish (the language of Dale) had the same\nrelationship to Rohirric and Westron as Old Norse has to English, so\nsince Westron was rendered in English, the language of Dale was rendered\nin Old Norse. The Dwarvish names were in the language of Dale, which\ntherefore was rendered in Old Norse in _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the\nRings._\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien took Durin's name, as with most other dwarf names in his\nwork, from real Norse mythology (in which _Durin_ was the name of the\nfirst of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves and the forger of many\nwonderful items).\n\nUpon his awakening at Mount Gundabad in the Years of the Trees, he\ntraveled until he came upon the Mirrormere, the lake that the Dwarves\ncall _Kheled-zâram_. He created there a great city within the Misty\nMountains. This was Khazad-dûm, known by Elves as _Moria_.\n\nAccording to the Dwarves, Durin awoke at Mount Gundabad in the north of\nthe Misty Mountains, which remained a sacred place to them ever after.\nDurin and his heirs were revered by all Dwarves, and not just those of\nhis own line.\n\nDurin founded the line of Dwarves called Durin's Folk. Durin was called\nthe Deathless because he lived far longer than any other known dwarf. It\nwas also believed that Durin would be reincarnated a total of six times,\neach time as a descendant of an older Durin.\n\nLater, while passing through Moria with the Fellowship, Gimli sang a\npoem about Durin."

It was there that the One\nRing was lost by Isildur and found again a long time later by Déagol the\nStoor.\n\n\nGeography\n\nThe fields started near the mouth of the river Gladden, and went on\nbeyond where it joined the Great River, extending onto its eastern\nbanks. It was a region of many dark pools and islets, with beds of reeds\nand rushes and many wildflowers - a particularly common flower being the\nYellow Iris, which grew there in profusion.\n\nIn ancient times when the Silvan Elves were in the region, there was a\npool or lake at the intersection of the two rivers; however, over time\nthis receded, forming the marshes.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIt was in the Gladden Fields that Isildur and his sons were travelling\nto Rivendell when they were assailed by Orcs in TA 2. Isildur, in an\nattempt to escape, jumped into the river, using the Ring to keep hidden.\nHowever, the Ring slipped from his finger as he swam away, landing in\nthe riverbed, and Isildur was slain by the Orcs' arrows on the bank of a\nsmall islet.\n\nThe fields were later settled by Stoors around TA 1356. The Ring\nremained undiscovered.\n\nAround two and a half millenia after the ambush, in TA 2463, the Hobbit\nDéagol found the ring when he was fishing with his cousin Sméagol: an\nespecially large fish pulled him under the water and, spotting it\namongst the weeds, he took it to the bank. Ensnared by the Ring's power,\nthe two fought over it, and ultimately it went to Sméagol, who killed\nDéagol and later became the creature called Gollum.\n\nLater, around TA 2851, Saruman began searching the wetlands for the\nRing. He found the Elendilmir, the token of Royalty of the\nNorth-kingdom, which Isildur had been wearing at the time of the attack.\nAt the meeting of the White Council that year, Saruman overruled\nGandalf's suggestion that they purge Sauron from his stronghold in Dol\nGuldur.\n\nSauron also sent his servants to search for the Ring. When the White\nCouncil learned of this, they agreed to an attack on Dol Guldur to\nprevent Sauron from finding the Ring, in TA 2941. At the meeting of the\nWhite Council in TA 2953, Saruman pretended that he had learned that the\nRing had been carried downriver to the Sea.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nGladden Fields was Sindarin for LOEG NINGLORON."

    "page_id": "862",
    "text": "The WAR OF WRATH, also called the GREAT BATTLE, was the war of Elves,\nMen, Dwarves and Valar against Morgoth at the end of the First Age,\nwhich marked the end of his rule in Middle-earth. It was the largest\nbattle of the First Age and possibly the largest battle ever to have\ntaken place in Middle-earth. It resulted in the expulsion of Morgoth\nfrom Arda and the ruin of the Thangorodrim, but the violence of the\nclashes between the forces of the Valar and Morgoth shattered the\nnorthwestern portion of Middle-earth, Beleriand, and caused it to sink\nbeneath the ocean.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nBy the early sixth century of the First Age, Morgoth's dominion had\nbecome completely uncontested in Middle-earth. The power of the Elves,\nMen, and Dwarves to resist him had been utterly destroyed, and all the\ngreat kingdoms of the Elves had been overthrown. Morgoth was now master\nof nearly all of Beleriand, save for the havens in Arvernien, which he\ngave little heed to. To make matters worse, and to the great amusement\nof Morgoth, the Sons of Fëanor, seeking the Silmaril of Beren and\nLúthien, had launched two devastatingly brutal Kinslayings in which they\nhad destroyed both Doriath and the Havens of Sirion. In this time of\nneed, the mariner Eärendil, by the guidance of a Silmaril which he wore\non his forehead, searched for and came to Valinor on behalf of Elves and\nMen. There, he begged the Valar to pardon and aid the overmatched\npeoples of Middle-earth.\n\nThe Battle\n\nDespite having pledged to leave the Ñoldor to reap the bitter harvest of\ntheir folly in pursuing Morgoth, Manwë was moved by Eärendil's plea.\nAlong with the Vanyar and the remaining Ñoldor in Aman, the host of the\nValar came to Middle-earth in the mightiest gathering of arms in the\nhistory of Arda. The Teleri of Alqualondë granted the use of their ships\nto ferry the hosts of Aman to Middle-earth, but they remembered still\nthe Kinslaying of their people long ago and harbored much bitterness\nover it. As such, they sent only what mariners were needed to man the\nships, and none of them set foot on Middle-earth once they arrived. The\ngreat force of Aman marched across Beleriand, and met the armies of\nMorgoth in the plains of Anfauglith. Morgoth marshaled the entirety of\nhis forces, which had by this point grown so vast that Anfauglith could\nnot contain their numbers.\n\nThough the war lasted for over 40 years, the host of the Valar utterly\ndestroyed the Orc armies of Morgoth, as well as most of the Balrogs.\nWhile the Three Houses of Men fought alongside the Valar, many other Men\nfrom the East fought for the forces of Morgoth and were either destroyed\nor forced to flee back to the far eastern parts of Middle-earth. Facing\nfinal defeat, Morgoth released his ultimate weapon, the winged Dragons,\nwhich had never been seen before. Their terrible onslaught was\naccompanied by lightning storms and tempests of fire, and they drove the\nValar back and nearly destroyed the host of the West.\n\n\n\nFortunately, Eärendil came with his sky-ship Vingilot, along with the\nEagles of Manwë led by Thorondor. In the skies above Angband, they\nconfronted the dragons, and Eärendil himself slew their captain, the\nmighty Ancalagon the Black, who broke the towers of Thangorodrim in his\nfall. Angband was then leveled and Morgoth was finally captured in the\ndeepest of his mines. He sued for peace and pardon, but he was bound\nagain with the old chain Angainor and the two Silmarils still in his\npossession were taken by the Maia Eönwë, the herald of Manwë. Morgoth\nwas taken to Aman and tried for his crimes. In the end, the Valar\nun-housed Morgoth by beheading him and “thrust him through the Door of\nNight”, beyond the Walls of the World, into the Timeless Void, the doors\nof which are forever guarded by Ëarendil.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe geographical wreckage of the war was immense; most of the land west\nof the Blue Mountains was destroyed and sank beneath the waves. Though\nit is not known exactly how many casualties the Host of the West\nendured, the war dragged on for decades before they managed to approach\nAngband, and the attack of Morgoth's winged dragons was known to have\nbeen nearly catastrophic for the forces of the Valar. While the hosts of\nMorgoth were utterly defeated, the creatures that composed them were not\neradicated, and many (particularly Orcs) remained to trouble the world\nunder the power of Sauron. Additionally, it was noted that a few Balrogs\nfled and hid deep in the Earth, though only one, known by the title of\nDurin's Bane, was ever noted by history to have appeared again. Some\nnumber of dragons, particularly Cold-drakes, also hid themselves away in\nthe mountains. These dragons bred over time, and became particularly\ntroublesome for the Dwarves in ages to come. Nearly all of the winged\nFire-drakes were destroyed by Ëarendil, Thorondor and his Eagles, but\nsome managed to escape, as at least one of the species, Smaug the\nGolden, was known to have been active during the Third Age.\n\nThe remaining Elves were bidden by Ëonwë to return with him to the lands\nof Aman. Most of the Elves went into the West, while others still\nrefused the summons and rather journeyed eastward where they would\nbecome lords of the remaining Eldar or those Elves who still dwelt in\nthe East. Gil-galad, Galadriel, Celeborn, and Elrond were chief among\nthese. Additionally, the victory was made even more bitter by the loss\nof the Silmarils. Maedhros and Maglor, the two surviving sons of Fëanor,\nwere compelled by their oath to recover the gems. Though sick at heart\nat the burden of the terrible oath, they conspired to sneak into the\ncamp of the victorious Host of the Valar, where they slew the guard\naround the Silmarils and took them. The camp was roused against them,\nand though they were prepared to fight to the death to keep the gems,\nthey were permitted to go. But they soon discovered that, due to the\nwicked deeds they had performed in recovering the jewels, first among\nthem the three Kinslayings, they could not hold the Silmarils without\nsuffering terrible pain. And so Maedhros cast himself and the Silmaril\nhe bore into a fiery pit, and Maglor threw his into the Sea. And so both\nwere lost to the Host of the Valar, and they returned to Aman empty\nhanded.\n\nFor those men of the Edain who fought for the host of the Valar, the\nland of Númenor (in the full Quenya form Nùmenórë) was given to them.\nThis land was neither of Aman nor of Middle-earth, but was closer to\nAman.\n",

Melkor built\nand delved many subterranean halls and dungeons of obsidian, fire and\nice beneath it .\n\n\nHistory\n\nWhen the world was young and Arda was bathed in the light of the two\nlamps Illuin and Ormal, Melkor first dug the great Pits of Utumno deep\nbeneath the mountains of the North. The fortress was constructed in the\nNorth in the Iron Mountains over one thousand miles from the later\nlocation of Angband, where the light of the lamps was almost\nnonexistent.\n\nHere were gathered all the evil powers of the World under the Lord of\nDarkness. Their numbers were vast, and Melkor had twisted many beautiful\nthings into horrifying and dreadful forms. Many of the great evils of\nthe world were bred in this place, such as trolls, “made in mockery of\nthe ents” as stated by Treebeard. It is probable that the Orcs were\nfirst bred here also, by the mutilating and corruption of lost Elves.\nCruel spirits, phantoms, wraiths, and evil demons stalked the halls of\nUtumno and haunted the surrounding forests. All were under the command\nof Melkor and his fallen Maiar servants; Gothmog the Lord of the Balrogs\nand Sauron the Sorcerer.\n\nFrom Utumno, Melkor poisoned and interfered with all the Valar's work\ndone during the Spring of Arda. Soon afterwards, Melkor and his servants\nwaged his war against the lamps of the Valar and struck them down,\nruining the world, and forcing the Valar to move further west to the\ncontinent of Aman.\n\nUtumno endured for many more millennia well into the early years of the\nElves at Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees when Middle-earth lay\nin the light of stars. Taking advantage of the new arrivals, Melkor\ncaptured some of them and thus, the hideous race of orcs was bred.\nKnowing that Melkor would continue to be a blight upon the world, the\nValar decided to protect the elves by ending his power in the north.\nAmidst the sounding of the trumpets, the Valar came out of the west, and\nafter the Battle of the Powers Utumno was besieged and destroyed in VY\n1099 , and Melkor was chained for about three thousand years.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_UTUMNO_ was the Quenya word for “Underworld”, also known as UDÛN\n(Sindarin for 'Hell').\n\n\nEarlier versions of the legendarium\n\nEarlier texts referred to Utumno as the FORTRESS OF THE NORTH or\n_UTUMNA_.\n\nAlso, its location had once been north of the Iron Mountains rather than\nwithin them.",

    "text": "ANGBAND, also known by its translation 'IRON PRISON', was the ancient\nfortress of Melkor under the Iron Mountains before the First Age, and\nfrom which he tried to subjugate Arda. It was destroyed at the\nconclusion of the War of Wrath. \n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nAngband was a primarily subterranean stronghold under the three volcanic\nmountains of Thangorodrim, the largest mountains in Middle-earth. Before\nthe Great Gate, there was a somber court area flanked by frightening\ncliffs and walled by the towers of a great battlement. Through the gate,\nthere was a long great tunnel leading to a 'labyrinthine pyramid' of\nstairs to corridors, tunnels, and smithy chambers. A tall chimney went\nfrom Morgoth's gigantic blast furnaces and smithies, up through the\nmountain to the smokey towers of Thangorodrim. There were also many\ntunnels leading to the slave quarters or vaults. At the foundation of\nAngband was the entrance to Morgoth's throne room in the Nethermost\nHall. There were also mines within Angband that extended deeper than\nMorgoth's throne room.\n\n\nHistory\n\nMelkor originally built Angband to guard against a possible attack from\nAman by the Valar, and placed it under the command of Sauron. However,\nat the initiation of the War of Powers, the assault of the Valar leveled\nAngband without much difficulty, and forced Melkor to flee to his\nprimary stronghold of Utumno. However, Angband's underground vaults and\ncaverns were left relatively intact after the Valar's onslaught, as they\nwere in great haste to capture Melkor for the sake of keeping the\nnewly-awakened Elves safe. After Melkor's defeat at Utumno, the Balrogs\ncame to Angband and went into hibernation in its ruined foundations.\nEventually, the Orcs began to multiply in great numbers in Angband's\nruins, and soon made their way south into Beleriand, threatening the\nDwarves and Thingol's kingdom. It is possible that Sauron remained in\nthe ruins of Angband with the Balrogs, as he had presumably been\ncommanding the fortress when it was attacked. However, it is not certain\nwhere Sauron dwelt during Melkor's imprisonment. After three ages,\nMelkor was released, destroyed the Two Trees of Valinor, stole the\nSilmarils and escaped from Aman.\n\nAfter fleeing, Melkor, now named _Morgoth_ by his enemies, returned to\nMiddle-earth and re-delved the ruins of Angband, raising the\nvolcanic peaks of Thangorodrim over it. These peaks were created from\nthe slag and rubble caused by the re-delving of the fortress, and as\nsuch, it is likely that the rebuilt Angband extended for a considerably\ngreater distance underground than it's original incarnation had. From\nhis dark throne in the Nethermost Hall, Morgoth directed the war against\nthe Ñoldor who had returned from the West, and all the Free Peoples that\nsupported them in Beleriand. Ultimately, he achieved complete victory\nover them. At the end of the First Age, the Valar took pity on the\nÑoldor and instigated the War of Wrath, which not only utterly destroyed\nAngband but broke most of northern Middle-earth so throughly that it\nsank beneath the ocean.\n\n\nEarlier versions of the legendarium\n\nIn earlier versions of Tolkien's mythology (see _The History of\nMiddle-earth_) Angband was called ANGAMANDO, which is the Quenya form of\nthe name.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Angband_ is a Sindarin word that meant 'iron prison'.",

It guarded the Pass of Sirion against\nthe power of Morgoth from the north.\n\n\nHistory\n\nWatchtower of the Ñoldor\n\nMinas Tirith was built early in the First Age by Finrod Felagund, to\nkeep watch upon the doings of Morgoth on the northern plain of\nArd-galen. Finrod entrusted it to Orodreth, his nephew and he ruled and\nheld it for his uncle to guard the vale of Sirion for many hundreds of\nyears.\n\nTime of Sauron's Dominion\n\nIn FA 457 it was invaded by Sauron in the aftermath of the Dagor\nBragollach and Orodreth was powerless to stop him from taking the isle,\nand fled south. Sauron, then also known as Gorthaur, renamed the island\n(and presumably the tower as well) TOL-IN-GAURHOTH or ISLE OF\nWEREWOLVES. Afterwards, Sauron began breeding large wolves in the isle\nwhich he sent evil spirits in, turning them into werewolves.\n\nAbout ten years later during the Quest for the Silmaril, Sauron\nimprisoned Beren Erchamion and Finrod there. Finrod was slain, but Beren\nwas rescued by Lúthien and the Hound Huan. Huan killed the wolves and\nLúthien got control over the isle's magic from Sauron.

The north-western boundary of Hithlum was formed by the\nEred Lómin which curved to meet Helcaraxë. The land of Nevrast was\nseparated from Hithlum by the southern part of the Ered Lómin.

It was founded by\nTurgon the Wise, a Ñoldorin lord in the early First Age. It endured the\nlongest of all the Ñoldorin kingdoms in exile, lasting nearly\nfour-hundred years of the Sun.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nAs recounted in _The Silmarillion_, the Vala Ulmo, the Lord of Waters,\nrevealed the location of the Vale of Tumladen to the Noldorin Lord\nTurgon in a dream around the year FA 50. Under this divine guidance,\nTurgon travelled from his kingdom in Nevrast and found the vale in FA\n53. Within the Encircling Mountains just west of Dorthonion and east of\nthe river Sirion, lay a round level plain with sheer walls on all sides\nand a ravine and tunnel leading out to the southwest known as the Hidden\nWay. In the middle of the vale there was a steep hill which was called\nAmon Gwareth. There Turgon decided to found a great city that would be\nprotected by the mountains and hidden from the Dark Lord Morgoth.\n\nFor nearly seventy-five years, Turgon and his people built Gondolin in\nsecret. After it was completed in FA 116, he took with him to dwell in\nthe hidden city his entire people in Nevrast — almost a third of the\nÑoldor — as well as nearly three quarters of the northern Sindar. The\ncity stood for nearly 400 years until it was betrayed to Morgoth by\nMaeglin, Turgon's nephew, and sacked shortly thereafter by the Dark\nLord's forces.\n\n\n\nGondolin was described as this - “Now the streets of Gondolin were paved\nwith stone and wide, kerbed with marble, and fair houses and courts amid\ngardens of bright flowers were set about the ways, and many towers of\ngreat slenderness and beauty builded of white marble and carved most\nmarvelously rose to the heaven. Squares there were lit with fountains\nand the home of birds that sang amid the branches of their aged trees,\nbut of all these the greatest was that place where stood the King's\npalace, and the tower thereof was the loftiest in the city, and the\nfountains that played before the doors shot twenty fathoms and seven in\nthe air and fell in a singing rain of crystal; therein did the sun\nglitter splendidly by day, and the moon most magically shimmered by\nnight. The birds that dwelt there were of the whiteness of snow and\ntheir voices sweeter than a lullaby of music.”\n\n\nSpecifications\n\nThe Hidden Way was protected by seven gates, all constantly guarded; the\nfirst of wood, then stone, Bronze, Iron, Silver, Gold, and Steel.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIt was originally called _ONDOLINDË_, which is Quenya for “The Rock of\nthe Music of Water”, after the springs of Amon Gwareth. The name was\nlater changed to its Sindarin form which meant HIDDEN ROCK.\n\n\nHouses of Gondolin\n\n\nPeople of interest\n\n-   Aredhel - Princess of Gondolin and sister of Turgon\n-   Elemmakil - Captain of the Guard of the Outer Gate\n-   Enerdhil - A possibly mythical jewel-smith of the city\n-   Voronwë - Mariner that accompanied Tuor to the city\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nGondolin was known as the “City of Seven Names”.

It stood in the centre of the Ring of\nIsengard, surrounded by great defensive walls fortified by the early Men\nof Gondor.\n\n\nDescription\n\n''“A great ring-wall of stone, like towering cliffs, stood out from the\nshelter of the mountain-side, from which it ran and then returned\nagain... one who passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel,\nbeheld a plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed like a vast shallow\nbowl: a mile it measured from rim to rim. Once it had been green and\nfilled with avenues, and groves of fruitful trees, watered by streams\nthat flowed from the mountains to a lake. But no green thing grew there\nin the latter days of Saruman. The roads were paved with stone-flags\ndark and hard; and beside their borders instead of trees there marched\nlong lines of pillars, some of marble, some of copper and of iron,\njoined by heavy chains, to the centre all the roads ran between their\nchains. There stood a tower of marvelous shape. It was fashioned by the\nbuilders of old, who smoothed the Ring of Isengard, and yet it seemed a\nthing not made by the craft of Men, but riven from the bones of the\nearth in the ancient torment of the hills. A peak and isle of rock it\nwas, black and gleaming hard: four mighty piers of many-sided stone were\nwelded into one, but near the summit they opened into gaping horns,\ntheir pinnacles sharp as the points of spears, keen-edged as knives.\nBetween them was a narrow space, and there upon a floor of polished\nstone, written with strange signs, a man might stand five hundred feet\nabove the plain.” ''\n\n- Orthanc as depicted by J.R.R Tolkien\n\nThe tower was constructed out of four piers of stone and then hardened\nby an unknown process. No weaponry or magic that existed on Arda was\nknown to be able to harm it. Until the Ents that besieged Isengard\nduring the War of the Ring managed to inflict slight damage on the\ntower, but their efforts ultimately proved to be futile. When Grima\nthrew the Orthanc stone it fell on the stairs; the rail snapped and part\nof the staircase broke.\n\nThe only entrance to the tower was reached by a stair of twenty-seven\nsteps, the door could only be opened with the Keys of Orthanc. Above the\ndoor there was a balcony, and many tall windows higher up.\n\n\nHistory\n\nSecond Age\n\n\n\nThe exact date of construction of Orthanc and establishment of Isengard\nis unknown; however it must have been built between SA 3320, the time of\nthe establishment of Arnor and Gondor, and SA 3430, when the Last\nAlliance of Elves and Men was formed. Within the fortified walls of the\ntower was placed one of the Palantíri, the Stone of Orthanc. Thus,\nOrthanc was now known as one of the seven towers of the Dúnedain,\nhousing the seventh seeing stone brought back from Númenor by Elendil.\n\nThird Age\n\nOrthanc suffered greatly during the Great Plague of TA 1636, and many of\nthe Númenóreans that inhabited it gradually migrated eastward.\nEventually the tower itself became deserted and its keys being moved to\nMinas Tirith to be kept by the Stewards of Gondor.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Field of Celebrant in TA 2510, a small group of\nMen of Gondor travelled to Isengard and maintained the fortress on their\nown. However, the Keys of Orthanc still officially belonged to the\nStewards of Gondor.\n\nOver time, Orthanc lost its connections with Minas Tirith and the Men of\nGondor failed to maintain the tower successfully. The Dunlendings then\ntook over the fortress and launched many attacks on the Westfold. In the\nLong Winter of TA 2754, the Dunlendings were eventually starved out due\nto the famine caused by the lack of communication to all food suppliers.\nThen Saruman put in an offer for the control of Isengard and both King\nFréaláf and Steward Beren embraced the proposition with open arms. Thus,\nthe wizard was handed the keys to Orthanc.\n\n\n\nAfter gaining the control of Isengard, Saruman became greatly interested\nin the Rings of Power and began to especially desire the One. He thought\nthat if he gave time for Sauron to regain some strength, the ring would\nreveal itself to him. Therefore, as head of the White Council, Saruman\noverruled Gandalf's call for an attack on Dol Guldur, the Dark Lord's\nthen current fortress. However in TA 2941, he did agree on the attack\nwhen he found out that the servants of Sauron were searching for the\nring near the Gladden Fields.\n\n\n\nLater, Saruman's mind was corrupted and fell under the control of Sauron\nwhen he used the Stone of Orthanc—the seventh Palantiri—for the first\ntime.\n\nIn TA 3018, Gandalf rode to Isengard to meet with Saruman. It was then\nthat the wizard declared his true thoughts regarding his desire to be\nruler of Men, to possess the Ring, and to join Sauron in his evil deeds.\nGandalf refused Saruman's offer to join him and Sauron. Subsequently,\nthe wizard held Gandalf captive on Orthanc's pinnacle until he submitted\nin telling the location of the One Ring. After many weeks of\nimprisonment, Gwaihir, the Lord of the Eagles, came unlooked for and\nbore him away.\n\nOnly months later, the Ents of Fangorn Forest launched their attack on\nIsengard. By the next day, only the tower of Orthanc remained, as it was\nhewn of one piece of impenetrable rock, and the plains below had been\ncompletely destroyed, leaving a desolate land of water and mud. Three\ndays after the battle, Theoden, Éomer, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and\nGimli approached Orthanc past a desolation of wreckage caused by the\nEnts including a huge blood-ridden white hand, and climbed its stair.\nThey parleyed with Saruman, who remained inside the tower and spoke to\nthem from a balcony above the door. After Saruman refused to cooperate\nand attempted to control the Rohirrim riding with them, Gandalf cast him\nfrom the Order of Wizards and the White Council, breaking Saruman's\nStaff. After the confrontation, Grima Wormtongue—who was inside the\ntower at the time—threw the Stone of Orthanc at the party outside as a\nparting shot.\n\nFourth Age\n\n\n\nOne of King Elessar's first tasks he had set was the restoration of\nOrthanc. He ordered that the Palantir should be recovered and returned\nto the tower. Then Orthanc was searched and many secrets were revealed.\nIt was clear that Saruman had been hoarding many ancient treasures and\nheirlooms during his time there. With the aid of Wormtongue, Saruman had\nacquired many jewels and heirlooms belonging to Eorl. Soon a hidden door\nwas found and inside a casket they found two precious objects: one of\nwhich was a small gold case attached to a chain - this was used by\nIsildur to bear the One Ring; and second of which was the Elendilmir -\nthe 'white star of Elvish crystal upon a fillet of mithril' that had\nbeen lost since Isildur's demise. Elessar received the Elendilmir with\nreverence and took it with him as he established his full kingship of\nArnor. It was revealed that Saruman had found the remains of Isildur and\nhad burned them.\n\nOrthanc and the plains of Isengard around it remained part of the\nReunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor. However, King Elessar granted the\nEnts complete self-governance of the area surrounding the tower. This\nnew forest became known as the Treegarth of Orthanc.\n\n\nPinnacle of Orthanc\n\n\n\nThe Pinnacle of Orthanc was the summit of Saruman's tower. Its corners\nwere razor-edged points with room for at least two men to stand. It was\naccessed by a flight of thousands of stairs, which Saruman would use to\nreach the top and observe the stars.\n\nIt was here where Saruman imprisoned Gandalf at the start of the War of\nthe Ring, which caused him to be delayed in meeting with Frodo. He was\nrescued by the Great Eagle Gwaihir, sent by Radagast the Brown.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nAccording to Tolkien, its name is both Sindarin for “Mount Fang”, and\nRohirric for “Cunning Mind”. The latter is more likely to be its real\nmeaning, as the word _Orthanc_ is a real Old English word (Old English\nbeing the linguistic basis for Rohirric); the Sindarin name being no\nmore than a poetic coincidence. In Old English, Orþanc means “cunning\ndevice”, but Tolkien has said this is merely a coincidence.",

    "text": "The KINGDOM OF RHOVANION was a realm of Men in the Middle-earth region\nof Rhovanion that is rarely given specifications in Tolkien's books.\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe kingdom of Rhovanion was founded by the northmen and stretched from\nMirkwood, in the west, to Dorwinion, in the east. It had strong ties\nwith the kingdom of Gondor and fought side by side in its wars against\nthe Easterlings of Rhûn.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the early Third Age, a group of Northmen who were led by a 'Prince of\nRhovanion' who founded the Kingdom of Rhovanion sometime before the year\nTA 490. Rhovanion at this time referred only to the region where he and\nhis people dwelt, a strip of land east of Greenwood the Great and south\nof Dale and Lake-town. It is possible that Dale and Lake-town formed\npart of the Kingdom before the Dwarven Kingdom in the Lonely Mountain\nwas founded by the Dwarves of Durin's Folk.\n\nThe Men of Rhovanion fought with Gondor against the Easterlings of Rhûn,\nwho threatened their lands, and when these were defeated by King\nTurambar of Gondor in TA 550, Rhovanion became an ally of Gondor. By TA\n1200 the ruler of Rhovanion called himself the King of Rhovanion. In TA\n1248 Rómendacil II of Gondor destroyed all camps of the Easterlings even\nbeyond the Sea of Rhûn, and a strong alliance with Rhovanion was forged.\nGondor withdrew its borders to the Anduin, and ceded all the lands east\nof Anduin to Rhovanion. From this time onward, the name Rhovanion\nreferred to all of Wilderland.\n\nThe King of Rhovanion at this time was Vidugavia, and Prince Valacar of\nGondor served in his army. Vidugavia's daughter Vidumavi married\nValacar, and their son Vinitharya became King Eldacar of Gondor in TA\n1432, which led to the Kin-strife in TA 1437. Eldacar fled to Rhovanion,\nand with a Rhovanion army, he reclaimed his Kingdom in TA 1447.\n\nIn TA 1636 the Great Plague devastated Rhovanion, killing more than half\nits people. This left Rhovanion weakened, and in TA 1851 the Wainriders\noverran and enslaved Rhovanion. For 43 years Rhovanion was enslaved, but\nin TA 1899 Rhovanion rebelled, while Gondor attacked the Wainriders from\nthe west. Rhovanion was freed, but left extremely weakened. Many Men of\nRhovanion left for Gondor, where they were welcomed as distant\nrelatives. Some of them may have gone north to Dale and Lake-town after\nTA 1999, when the Kingdom under the Mountain was founded.\n\nIn TA 2460 Sauron returned to Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood, although\nthis was not learned until long after. The land gradually became more\ndangerous, and Rhovanion was emptied of most its people. Around TA 2510\na new group of Easterlings, the Balchoth, appeared, and they quickly\ntook the old lands of Rhovanion. This was the final end of the Kingdom\nof Rhovanion after over two thousand years of independence.",

It was the first permanent settlement of the\nNúmenóreans in Middle-earth. From here Aldarion's “Guild of Venturers”\nbegan harvesting the local timber for the shipbuilding industry of\nNúmenor.\n\nWithin a few centuries, the deforestation of the outlying regions\nEnedwaith and Minhiriath became cataclysmic, angering the local native\npopulation (ancestors of the Dunlendings), and they began to fight back\nwith increasing ferocity, destroying the haven several times, and\nfrequently burning the great wood-stores in 'hit-and-run' attacks.\n\nBy the time of the War of the Elves and Sauron in the middle of the\nSecond Age, this 'New Haven' had become very well established, and its\nname had shifted over the intervening one thousand years to 'Lond Daer',\nthe Great Haven. As such, it was one of the two beachheads of the\nNúmenórean forces in Eriador that were used to support the elves around\nSA 1700.\n\nLond Daer's shipyards were starved of timber following the war, as the\nforces of Sauron had burnt almost all of what remained in Enedwaith and\nMinhiriath. Once its shipbuilding yards were no longer practicable, Lond\nDaer declined in importance, and the Númenórean hunger for ever more\nwealth shifted focus to the establishment of newer havens to the south,\nPelargir and Umbar. Following this, Lond Daer was once again renamed,\nbeing now one of several major ports in Middle-earth, and was known as\nLOND DAER ENEDH, or 'Great Middle Haven'. Despite this, Númenor still\nmaintained traffic on the Gwathló as far as the city of Tharbad.\n\nAfter the Downfall of Númenor, Elendil founded the realm of Arnor in the\nlands north of Lond Daer, but the haven was now redundant, and fell into\nruin. Instead, control over the region was maintained from Tharbad. The\nancient ruins of Lond Daer were still visible as late as the end of the\nThird Age, however, and still featured on maps from that time.",

    "text": "MINHIRIATH was a region of Eriador in Middle-earth.\n\nIts expanse covered the western half of the lands between the Misty\nMountains and the Blue Mountains (Ered Luin). Minhiriath had no clear\nborder in the north, but to the south, and east and west it was bounded\nby river and sea: the Brandywine, the Greyflood and the Belegaer, 'The\nGreat Sea'.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe original inhabitants of Minhiriath (Minhiriathrim) were descended\nfrom the same Men as the ancestors of the Númenóreans, but because they\nspoke mutually unintelligible languages, the Númenóreans did not class\nthe Minhiriathrim as Middle Men.\n\nWhen the large-scale deforestation of their land began under the\nNúmenórean 'Ship Kings' after the 7th century Second Age, the\nMinhiriathrim became openly hostile, and were persecuted. Only those who\n“fled from Minhiriath into the dark woods of the great Cape of Eryn\nVorn” survived. Most, if not all of these forest-dwellers subsequently\n“welcomed Sauron and hoped for his victory over the Men of the Sea”, but\nthey were to be disappointed - and permanently trapped - by Sauron's\nburning of much of the rest of the surviving forest, and final defeat,\nin SA 1701.\n\nFrom SA 3320, Minhiriath became nominally part of the newly established\nKingdom of Arnor, at which time it formed the upper part of _..a land\nthat was far and wide, on either bank a desert, treeless but untilled._\n\n('The History of Galadriel and Celeborn' from Unfinished Tales)\n\nFrom TA 861, Minhiriath was inherited by one of Arnor's three successor\nstates, Cardolan, but the “ravaging” of Cardolan by the evil forces of\nthe Witch-king of Angmar in TA 1409 no doubt caused extensive\ndepopulation of the whole country. Even worse was the advent of the\nGreat Plague in TA 1636, after which Minhiriath was “almost entirely\ndeserted”. After TA 1975, even though “a few secretive hunter-folk lived\nin the woods” throughout the Third Age (probably a reference which\nincludes Eryn Vorn), Minhiriath was claimed by no kingdom at all.\n\nAlthough “still in places well-wooded” by the time of the War of the\nRing, the once continuously forested Minhiriath bore the permanent scars\nof over 5000 years of felling, burning, and war.\n\nThe same is not necessarily the case for its human population, however,\nwhen talking of Eriador (and particularly the lands south and west of\nBree) to an innkeeper at the end of the War of the Ring. For example,\nGandalf confidently predicts that _..the waste in time will be waste no\nlonger, and there will be people and fields where once there was\nwilderness._\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Minhiriath_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Between Rivers' and thus an\nElvish form of _Mesopotamia_)."

    "text": "The BLACK NÚMENÓREANS were a fallen group of Númenóreans who were\ndescended from those loyal to the Númenórean crown but opposed to the\nValar and relations with the Elves. They listened to the words of\nSauron. Soon they were corrupted by him, and would come to worship the\nDarkness and Morgoth.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nSecond Age\n\nOrigins\n\nAs the power and knowledge of the Númenóreans grew throughout the course\nof the Second Age, they became increasingly preoccupied with the limits\nplaced on their contentment in the world - and eventually their power -\nby mortality, the purpose of which they began to question.\n\nAs time went on they began to fear death more and more and ultimately\nwished to escape it. So the Númenóreans became envious of the immortal\nElves (the Eldar), whom they had come to physically resemble as part of\ntheir reward from Ilúvatar for having been their allies. The Eldar\nsought ever to remind the Men of Númenor however, that death was a gift\nfrom Ilúvatar to all Men, and to lose faith in Ilúvatar would be\nheretical.\n\nNevertheless, after SA 2221, when Tar-Ancalimon became King of Númenor.\nThe 'King's Men' therefore became increasingly predisposed to the\ncorruption of Sauron after he came to Númenor.\n\nEventually, in Númenor's last years, its hugely powerful but elderly\nKing Ar-Pharazôn, who had become “frightened of old age” (_Letters_,\nno.156), was persuaded by Sauron that Ilúvatar was a lie invented by the\nValar, and seduced him. Within Númenor, the majority immediately\nfollowed suit, and this worship quickly passed across the ocean when\nthey sailed eastwards from Númenor, to most of Númenor's colonies in\nMiddle-earth where the group started in proper.\n\nThe group thrived in Middle-earth, particularly in Umbar after the\ndestruction of Númenor. They continued to oppose The Faithful, from\nwhich came the Kings of Arnor and Gondor, the Black Númenóreans remained\nloyal towards Sauron.\n\nThree of the Ringwraiths can be considered among the first and most\npowerful Númenóreans who were corrupted by Sauron, 1000 years before the\nDownfall: they served Sauron, being enslaved to his will, having become\nso because of their lust for power or knowledge.\n\nThese sacrilegious 'black arts' and 'follies', which arose as a\nconsequence of their worship of 'The Dark' and Melkor, marked the final,\nirrevocable division between the 'King's Men' and the minority known as\nthe 'Faithful' Númenóreans, or the 'Elendili', who kept to their old\nfaith in Ilúvatar. They were also presumably the earliest culture traits\nof those who became known afterwards as Black Númenóreans.\n\nAfter the Fall of Númenor\n\nFor many centuries after the Downfall, descendants of the 'King's Men'\nheld onto colonies in Middle-earth, what became the most northerly and\nfamous of their Realms in Exile, Umbar.\n\nMost of those few Númenóreans who had never disavowed the Eldar, and had\nalways remained true to their belief in Ilúvatar, also survived the\ndestruction of their homeland, and they established their own Realms in\nExile north of Umbar, in familiar and friendly colonies. The Faithful\nNúmenóreans saw their southern counterparts as renegades. The Black\nNúmenóreans held a similarly low opinion of 'The Faithful' and their\ndescendants.\n\nOnly two Black Númenórean lords are named from the time of the late\nSecond Age: Herumor and Fuinur. Like all Black Númenóreans and 'King's\nMen' before them, Herumor and Fuinur desired power over men of other,\n lesser races, and they “rose to (great)\npower amongst the Haradrim”, the peoples neighbouring Umbar. Their fate\nis unknown, but they were likely defeated along with Sauron at the War\nof the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.\n\nThird Age\n\nThe Black Númenórean style of rule was no doubt tyrannical, but may also\nhave involved a tradition of duumviracy, at least in Umbar, whose lords\nare usually paired when mentioned; Herumor/Fuinur for example, were\nprobably rulers of Umbar, as much later Angamaitë/Sangahyando were.\nWhatever political system was in place, however, the Black Númenóreans\ndid not govern effectively.\n\nThe triumph of the Last Alliance marked the decline of the Black\nNúmenórean race and the end of their racial superiority. Nevertheless,\nthe Black Númenórean elite survived at least in Umbar for over a\nthousand years after Númenor's fall, maintaining much influence in\nHaradwaith. As late as Angamaitë for example, even after being exiled\nfrom their homeland for nearly a century.\n\nBlack Numenoreans in the 3rd age eventually joined The Witch King of\nAngmar in his conquests of Arnor. The fate of the Black Numenoreans of\nAngmar is unknown, but it's most likely they either all died or\ndisbanded after the Battle of Fornost.\n\nThe Black Númenóreans did not use Westron, but probably retained their\nold tongue Adûnaic, speaking a dialect of it. (In The Notion Club\nPapers, part of Sauron Defeated, Arundel Lowdham cited two descendants\nof classical Adûnaic. One of these must have been Westron, the other the\ntongue of the Black Númenóreans (Black Adûnaic?).\n\nThe Black Númenóreans are absent from recorded history after their\ndefeat by Ciryaher in TA 1050, but a  population of sorts must have survived somewhere at least\nuntil the end of the Third Age, as the Mouth of Sauron, who mocked the\narmy of King Elessar in front of the Black Gate was described both as a\nBlack Númenórean and “Renegade”, which is presumably the term used by\nthe Free Peoples of that time to describe all folk of similar ancestry.\n\nIn one of his letters, Tolkien wrote that Queen Berúthiel, wife of\nGondor's King Tarannon Falastur was a Black Númenórean, from a Black\nNúmenórean realm he describes as “the inland city” somewhere south of\nUmbar. This was a loveless union, and was presumably a political\naccommodation: that such arrangements were possible implies the\nexistence at that time of more Gondor-friendly Black Númenóreans than\nthe much later Mouth of Sauron.",

They were\nalso on average very tall; with Six foot, four inches being the average\namong them. Many far exceeded such height; Elendil himself being\nnicknamed “_ELENDIL THE TALL_” being over seven feet high. One\ncharacteristic that set them apart from typical men was their ages.\nNúmenóreans were not immortal as the Elves or Ainur, however in\ngratitude in their service during the War of the Wrath, they were\nblessed with extended lifespans averaging over 300 years. Bloodlines\nfrom the House of Elros could live for over 400-500. They aged slower\nthan their typical counterparts.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFrom the start, the friendship of the Númenóreans was between the\nDúnedain of the West and the Eldar of Eressëa. The white swan ships of\nthose Eldar brought many gifts to the Númenóreans: birds, trees, herbs,\nand more. Unfortunately, as time progressed, the kings of Numenor began\nto envy the Eldar for their immortality, and a fear of death infected\nthe island. Later on, kings fell dead, decrepit and witless, as they\nhopelessly clung to their lives. Thus faded the bliss of the\nNúmenóreans, if not their power. They had sailed the earth to the East\nin their wooden ships, and even glimpsed from their tall ship prows the\nGates of Morning, in the eastern continent. They founded many colonies\nin Mortal Lands, north and south, and there they ruled. With the gradual\ncreation of a colonial empire, the pride of the Kings grew. The old\ncustoms were for the most part abandoned; those that were kept were kept\nout of fear of the Valar. Most of the Númenóreans distanced themselves\nfrom the Eldar, and towards the end they persecuted any who were in\nfellowship with them. The 25th King, and also the last, Ar-Pharazôn, was\nmade angry by the reemerging Sauron in Mordor. The King sent a vast\narmy, so large and imposing that Sauron found himself deserted by his\nown armies, not a single large battle fought. But what Sauron could not\ncrush with his armies, he would manipulate with cunning mind and\nhoneyed-tongue. He prostrated himself before Pharazôn, and was taken\nprisoner. In less than three years, the Dark Lord had gone from\ntop-priority prisoner to the King's greatest councilor. All save one\n(Lord Amandil of Andúnië) of the Royal Council fawned on Sauron.\n\nAfter many years, the king felt the shadow of death near, and Sauron,\never the opportunist, seized his chance. He told the aging king of “The\nGiver of Freedom and Life” Melkor, behind closed doors. The king,\ndesperate to escape death, turned to the worship of the Dark. At\nSauron's urging, a great temple was built, and the tree Nimloth was cut\ndown, though not before Isildur, Amandil's grandson, escaped with a\nfruit of the tree. In the year 3310 SA, Sauron urged Pharazôn to take\nwhat the king desired for so long, the immortality of Aman. In 9 years,\na vast fleet was made ready, and Pharazôn, almost wavering, boarded his\nflagship, Alcarondas, and set sail. 39 days later, Numenor met with\napocalypse. The king had landed at Aman, and the Valar had ceded\nguardianship of Arda to Eru. Eru tore Aman away from the world, and\nformed the flat disc of Arda into a globe.  Númenor\nwas flooded, and its proud towers and walls crumbled. Sauron was taken\nunawares, and his last fair form was destroyed, and “as a gale” he\nescaped. Not all the Númenóreans were killed, however. Nine ships, led\nby Elendil son of Amandil escaped to the North of Middle-earth, and\nthere founded the kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor. The race of Black\nNúmenórean colonists existed far away in Harad still, as well as the\nrest of the Númenóreans' colonies.",

    "text": "The AVARI were a branch of the Elves in Middle-earth.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nWhen Oromë found that Elves that awakened in Cuiviénen, he invited them\nto come with him to Valinor. All the Minyar and most of the Tatyar and\nNelyar were persuaded and followed Oromë into the west on the Great\nJourney. The remainder of the Tatyar and Nelyar remained suspicious of\nthe Lords of the west, seeing them only in their wrath, or they simply\nrefused to depart from their own lands, and spread gradually throughout\nthe wide lands of Middle-earth. They were after known in Quenya, the\nlanguage of the Eldar that eventually reached Valinor, by the name\n_Avari_, meaning “the Unwilling”, because they refused the summons.\n\nHaving never come to Valinor, the Avari remained wild folk, dwellers of\nforests. Little is known of them, as they do not appear in any of the\ntales, save some references to Avari creeping in the south of Beleriand\nin the First Age. Some of them merged with the Nandor and Sindar in\nEriador and the Vale of Anduin. Also, it is speculated that the Dark\nElves were the first other sentient race encountered by the race of Men\nduring their infancy. The Dark Elves probably taught them many of the\nbasic crafts of civilization, though the craft of the Eldar surpassed\nthat of the Avari even more than that of the Avari surpassed primitive\nMen.\n\nIn _The War of the Jewels_, names of six tribes of Avari in their own\nlanguages are given, all being cognates of the Quenya word Quendi (_the\nSpeakers_): KINDI, CUIND, HWENTI, WINDAN, KINN-LAI, PENNI. They are the\nonly certain Avarin words ever mentioned in the published Middle-earth\nmaterial. It is speculated however that Dorwinion was an Avarin land,\nwith WINION carrying the meaning of “Wine”.\n\nThe Silmarillion contains a suggestion that orcs may be descended from\nAvarin elves captured and corrupted by Melkor.\n\nEöl was called the 'Dark Elf' for he shuns the daylight, preferring to\nstay within the dark woods of Nan Elmoth and walk under the moon and\nstarlights but he is not of Avari origin for he is a kin of Thingol. His\nroots lies with the Teleri, who did not go to Aman, later called the\nSindarin under the rule of Thingol and Melian the Maia.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn older versions of the legendarium, the name _Avari_ was originally\nthat of the later Eldar, then meaning “those that departed”.\n\nIn other, relatively late writings, a brief idea was that the Avari did\nnot come from the three clans, but from two other clans, led by Nurwë\nand Morwë. This idea was later dropped. In the final conception, the\nelves were divided into three tribes."

    "text": "_THE LETTERS OF J. R. R. TOLKIEN_ (ISBN 0-618-05699-8) is a collection\npublished in 1981 of 354 selected letters written by J.R.R. Tolkien over\nthe course of his lifetime, which were edited where necessary by\nTolkien's biographer Humphrey Carpenter with the help of his son\nChristopher Tolkien. The selection contains 354 letters dates between\nOctober 1914 when Tolkien was an undergraduate at Oxford and August 29\n1973 four days before his death.\n\nThe book is now published by George Allen and Unwin (UK) and Houghton\nMifflin (US).\n\n\nFormation of the Book\n\nHumphrey Carpenter first collected and transcribed all the letters and\nmade the initial selection based upon that. Then Christopher Tolkien\ncommented upon his work and made various suggestions for changes, which\nwhere then discussed among them and adopted with various emendations.\nThey then found it necessary to reduce the text quite severely for\nconsideration of space. Humphrey then proposed the initial cuts on which\nChristopher again made various suggestions after which they came up with\na final procedure which was needed in order to make this collection\nhappen. The collection of letters therefore reflects Humphrey tastes and\njudgement more then that of Christopher. Even though it is still their\njoined work.\n\n\nContents of the Collection\n\n-   Introduction\n-   Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien\n-   Notes\n-   Index\n\n\nTypes of Letters\n\nThe 354 letters can be roughly divided into four categories:\n\n-   Personal letters to his family, namely to his wife Edith Tolkien,\n    his son Christopher Tolkien and all his other children and even some\n    grandchildren.\n-   Letters concerning his career as a professor of Anglo-Saxon\n-   Letters send to his publishers Allen & Unwin explaining his often\n    continued failing to meet deadlines and other topics related to\n    publishing a book and\n-   Letters about Middle-earth, this category is for obvious reasons the\n    most interesting to Tolkien fans as it provides a lot of information\n    about Middle-earth which at the time of publishing could not\n    anywhere else in the then published works by Tolkien himself and his\n    then posthumously published work by his son Christopher.\n\nInteresting examples\n\nIn letters 29 & 30, we find out that a German translation of _The\nHobbit_ was being negotiated in 1938. The German firm inquired whether\nTolkien was of 'arisch' (Aryan) origin. Tolkien was infuriated by this,\nand wrote two letters as a response. In the first one Tolkien apparently\nrefused to give any declaration whatsoever of his origin and in the\nsecond one he proudly protested on the inquiry and, among other things,\nreplied that “... I regret that I appear to have _no_ ancestors of that\ngifted  people”. He gave his editor the choice on which reply to\nuse. This second letter is the only one preserved and it is probable\nthat the first one was sent."

    "text": "DUNLENDINGS, also known as\nWILDMEN OF DUNLAND, were the people of Dunland. They were known as a\nfierce culture of Men who sought vengeance on the people of Rohan who,\nas Saruman rightly said, drove them into the mountains. In _The Two\nTowers_, Saruman used their anger to manipulate and convince them to\ndestroy the land of Rohan during the War of the Ring. He sends them\nacross Rohan, burning and looting the land.\n\nDunlending Wildmen come from the land of Dunland. When looting Rohan\nearlier in the Third Age, they are led by a Dunlending named Wulf son of\nFreca.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nIn the years of the Second Age before the Númenóreans settled in\nMiddle-earth, the tribal Hill-men inhabited the lands west and south of\nthe Misty Mountains, as far down as the valleys surrounding the White\nMountains.\n\nWary of the men who came out of the west, they came to fear and hate\nthem. They were hunted and persecuted in such numbers that they had\ndwindled by the start of the Third Age. At this time they had come to\ncongregate in the valleys of the White Mountains and the grassy plains\nof Dunland, which lay west of the Misty Mountains between Moria and\nIsengard; a few went north, and became the ancestors of the Men of Bree.\nDunland then became the area most populated by these men, who came to be\ncalled Dunlendings.\n\n\n\nWhen Eorl and his people were granted Calenardhon --- Rohan, as it would\nlater be known --- in TA 2510, they drove the Wild Men from their new\nlands, earning their bitter hatred and enmity. The Wild Men were also\ndriven from the White Mountains by the Men of Gondor. During the next\nfive hundred years these shorter, dark-haired warriors made frequent\nattacks upon the outlying settlements of Rohan, exacting revenge upon\nthe usurpers, whom they called “straw-heads” because of the high number\nof blond warriors among them.\n\nAs a consequence, Rohan maintained patrols and garrisons to the west of\nthe Fords of Isen to try to limit the number of raids, although these\npatrols had virtually disappeared under Wormtongue's stewardship, to the\npoint where Saruman's forces could make incursions almost at will.\n\nYet not everybody took against the Wild Men. At some point near the end\nof the thirtieth century of the Third Age, Saruman made contact with\nthem and swayed them to his side by playing on their resentment and\nhatred of those who had taken what was theirs.\n\nSaruman welcomed to Orthanc a large warband of these Dunlendings.\nSaruman evidently convinced them that they could reclaim what had been\ntaken, and during the early part of TA 3019, a fearsome raiding force\ncomprising Dunlendings, Orcs and Uruk-hai left Isengard and began\nravaging the western settlements of Rohan. Previous attacks by Orcs and\nUruk-hai had killed many Rohirrim at the Fords of Isen, so there were no\nwarriors to defend against the surprise attack.\n\n\n\nMany people of Rohan were killed in these attacks, but the raiders never\nmade it across the country to Edoras; it is fair to assume that they\nencountered one or more Éoreds, companies of mounted warriors, who would\nhave been patrolling the interior. After the defeat of Isengard at the\nBattle of the Hornburg, the Rohirrim spared the surviving Dunlendings\nand used them as workmen to repair the broken walls of the Hornburg.\n\nThe Rohirrim's mercy surprised the Dunlendings, as Saruman had convinced\nthem the Rohirrim would slaughter them all if given the chance. When\nGandalf, Frodo Baggins, Sam Gamgee, Merry Brandybuck, and Pippin Took\nwere traveling through Dunland on their way back towards the the Shire,\nthe Dunlendings in that area hid from them. After the War of the Ring,\nthe Dunlendings sent ambassadors to the court of King Aragorn, thus\nfinally began peace and diplomacy between Gondor and Rohan with the\nDunlending realms.\n\n\n\n\nCulture\n\nThe Dunlendings were hill-folk used to living in harsh conditions, often\nseen in leather garb and fur cloaks. They may have been related to the\nSnowmen of Forochel in the north. They were a tough, hardy people, big\nand powerful with long, unkempt hair and beards. The Dunlendings,\nbecause they lived in the hilly and forested area of Dunland, most\nlikely hunted, foraged, and fished for food, with agriculture being a\nlesser form of food production.\n\nThe Dunlendings, due to their way of life, probably were very skilled\nwith bows. Dunlendings are also described as using cavalry at the Fords\nof Isen. Most Dunlendings probably fought, however, on foot, with long\nspears, axes and other melee weapons (as with most self-arming forces,\nswords were expensive and therefore a rarity).  Armour for most soldiers\nwas light, but well-off warriors and chieftains likely made use of\nchainmail and were clad similarly as their Rohirrim counterparts.\n",

The rebelling Ñoldor fleeing Valinor crossed to\nMiddle-earth by ship and by way of the dangerous ice crossings on the\nHelcaraxë. Fëanor's host crossed by ship along the coasts while\nFingolfin's host made the difficult journey, coming up from Aman along\nthe shoreline and across the ices of the Helcaraxë.\n\nWhen the Valar declared war on Morgoth's tyranny in Middle-earth, the\nhost was ferried across the Belegaer by the Swanfleet's of the Falmari.\nAfter the War of Wrath, the Belegaer was widened again by the drowning\nof the Beleriand in Middle-earth. The Helcaraxë in the north was\nremoved, ending all land access to the Undying Lands.\n\nAfter the Changing of the World\n\nDuring the Akallabêth in the later Second Age, Eru “bent” the sea and\nmade the world round. Aman was removed from the world to another realm\nin Eä which only Elves and a chosen few could find, who would travel the\nStraight Road to Valinor. Now mortal mariners traveling into west\nsearching for the summit of Meneltarma, said to be in the middle of sea\nfound neither the summit or Aman only the New Lands set in the far\nwest.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Belegaer_ is of the Sindarin words 'beleg' which meant 'mighty' and\n'aer' or e_är_, meaning 'sea' (which is also present in the name\n_Eärendil_). The Quenya name of Belegaer, never used in published\nwriting, is _Alatairë_.\n\n\nNotable features\n\nIslands\n\n-   Tol Eressëa\n-   Enchanted Isles seaward of Tol Eressëa\n-   Númenor (Second Age only)\n-   Tol Morwen\n-   Tol Fuin\n-   Himling\n-   Balar (First Age only)\n-   Tolfalas, in the Bay of Belfalas\n\nBodies of water\n\n-   Bay of Eldamar\n-   Bay of Balar (First Age only)\n-   The Great Gulf (First Age only)\n-   Firth of Drengist (First Age only)\n-   Ice-Bay of Forochel (after First Age)\n-   Gulf of Lune (after First Age)\n-   Bay of Belfalas (after First Age)",

For many ages they grew peacefully, but in\nMiddle-earth at the beginning of the Ages of the Stars there came among\nthe trees great spirits later known as Ents. These protectors appeared\nbecause many other races in that time came into the world and Yavanna\nfeared that the forests would be destroyed. So through the Ages of the\nStars and Sun, the Ents walked the forests, and in time it is said some\nEnts became more tree-like and the ancient trees became more Ent-like\nand limb-lithe. Like Ents, they learned the Art of Speech. Whether tree\nor Ent in the beginning, by the Third Age of the Sun they were a race\napart, referred to as _Huorns_.\n\nThe Huorns mostly stood as dark trees in the deepest forests, gnarled\nand unmoving, yet watchful. When aroused in wrath they moved swiftly as\nif wrapped in shadows, falling on foes with deadly and merciless\nstrength.\n\nThe tale of the War of the Ring tells of how, with the Ents, the Huorns\nmarched on Isengard like a great forest, and how, under the direction of\nthe Ents, they exterminated the entire Orc legion in the Battle of the\nHornburg.\n\nHuorns were ancient and long-brooding, and some were said to be\nblack-hearted and rotten. At least one such sentient tree spirit\ninhabited the Old Forest by the banks of the Withywindle River, who was\ncalled Old Man Willow. As the Old Forest and Fangorn were the last\nremnants of the most ancient forests in Middle-earth, Old Man Willow\nwished to prevent further inroads into his realm. He held all the Old\nForest in an enchantment by the power of his song and led all travellers\nto him, where with his limb-lithe roots and branches he consumed them.\n\nIn _The Two Towers,_ the Huorns are witnessed to march to Isengard with\nthe Ents. After Isengard is harrowed of its orcs, most of the Huorns\nchased and killed them after the Battle of the Hornburg. After this\nbrief appearance, the Huorns went back into the forests. The tactics\nused by the Huorns were quite effective, as they only attacked when all\nthe enemy Orcs would be in their midst, denying the orcs chance of\nescape. It is notable that Huorns seemed to have the ability to cloak\nthemselves in shadows, becoming almost undetectable at night."

They were added to the number of High Elves, and they\nshared the lands with the Dwarves.\n\nThe best known Wood-elves are the Elves of the Woodland Realm in\nNorthern Mirkwood and Lothlórien. In the First Age the elves of\nOssiriand, the Laiquendi, were also referred to as Wood-elves.\n\nSilvan Elves were of Nandorin descent but they were mainly governed by\nSindar and Noldorin rulers. Examples of such rulers were Thranduil, the\nKing of the Woodland Realm in Northern Mirkwood, Amdír and his son,\nAmroth, who ruled over Lothlórien, and Celeborn, who too ruled over\nLothlórien with his wife Galadriel who was a Ñoldor elf.\n\nSilvan Elves were considered to be less wise than other Eldar, but were\nmore wise than men. Some of them were almost indistinguishable from the\nAvari, those who never joined the Great Journey.\n\nMirkwood\n\nThe Silvan Elves of Mirkwood (formerly known as Greenwood the Great)\nwere known to be distrustful of Dwarves but friendly to Men, with whom\nthey trade. Mirkwood had been called Greenwood the Great until around\nthe year TA 1050, when the shadow of the Dark Lord Sauron fell upon it,\nand men began to call it Mirkwood. During his journey to the Lonely\nMountain, Bilbo Baggins had to rescue the Dwarves of Thorin II\nOakenshield's company from these Elves. These Elves were also one of the\narmies in the Battle of the Five Armies.\n\nLegolas of the Fellowship of the Ring, although he lived among them and\npresented himself as one of the Silvan folk, was not one of them. As a\nson of the Elven-king Thranduil, who had originally come from Doriath,\nLegolas was actually at least half of Sindarin heritage on his father's\nside (his mother's identity is unknown, though it is likely she was of\nSilvan background). This was complicated by the fact that a small\nminority of Sindarin Elves ruled the predominantly Silvan Woodland Realm\nof Northern Mirkwood, a minority to which Legolas belonged. The Sindarin\nminority in that realm, who should have been nobler and wiser than the\nSilvan Elves, could be seen as having “gone native” at the end of the\nFirst Age after Morgoth was defeated and all the grand elf kingdoms of\nBeleriand were destroyed.\n\nIn the cartoon version of _The Hobbit_, they have been depicted as\nhaving green skin and brown clothes which were very primitive in\ncomparison to the other elves portrayed in the movie.\n\n\n\nLórien\n\nThe Silvan Elves of Lórien were known as part of the Galadhrim,\nliterally “tree-folk”. However, the Galadhrim of Lorien also included a\nmixture of elves of Nandor, Noldor, and Sindar descent. Galadriel was of\nNoldor descent, being the daughter of Finarfin, while Celeborn was of\nSindarin descent of the Kingdom of Doriath. At the time of the War of\nthe Ring they spoke an accent or dialect of Sindarin which had changed\nso much that Frodo Baggins, who spoke Sindarin, could not understand\nthem. Additionally, few Elves of Lórien could speak Westron, so that\nHaldir, one of the few that could, had to accompany them on their way to\nCaras Galadhon. Haldir has been speculated to be a Sindarin Elf, but\nthere is no absolute evidence to confirm this. The only evidence is that\nhe shares the white blond hair of Thranduil and Legolas, who themselves\nare Sindarin."

    "text": "SILVAN ELVES (also known as '''Woodland Elves ''') are a subgroup of\nthe Nandor, and are thus ultimately of Telerin origin. As Úmanyar, they,\nlike the Sindar, began the Great Journey but did not complete it. In the\nThird Age, most remaining Silvan Elves lived either in Lothlórien or the\nWoodland Realm.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOrigin\n\nThe Silvan Elves were of Nandorin background, descended from the\nfollowers of Lenwë, who were fascinated by the landscape East of the\nMisty Mountains and afraid to attempt to cross them. They thus abandoned\nthe Great Journey, choosing instead to remain in those wide forests,\nwhere they became a scattered people.\n\nLittle is known of the wanderings of the Nandor, save that they spread\nthroughout the Vales of Anduin over a period of many centuries, some\nfollowing the Great River southward, eventually settling at the Mouths\nof Anduin or instead turning north again into Eriador, where eventually\nDenethor gathered as many as he could and crossed the Blue Mountains\ninto Beleriand. These were later known as the Green-Elves of Ossiriand,\nand were welcomed by Thingol as long lost kin.\n\nSome of the Nandor however stayed in the forested Vales, and these would\nbecome the Silvan Elves - hidden away in their woodland fastnesses and\nwere to their estranged kin hardly distinguishable from the Avari, and\nindeed sometimes living in friendship with them. Their language had\ndiverged to such an extent that it was barely intelligible to the Sindar\nand Noldor when these met the Silvan Elves again in the Second Age,\nthough the languages were found to be obviously related. It was not\nuntil this renewed contact between the kindreds and the guidance of the\nSindar and Noldor that the Silvan Elves again became an organised people\nand increased in wisdom. This however also led to the Silvan tongue\nbeing largely forgotten, Sindarin instead becoming the primary spoken\nlanguage by the end of the Third Age, with the Silvan dialects only\nsurviving in several names of places and persons. \n\nThe renewed contact was caused by the destruction of Beleriand after the\nWar of Wrath, for when the Second Age was young, the Silvan Elves\nwelcomed those survivors of the calamity who rather than crossing the\nSea rejoined their kindred east of the Misty Mountains. Indeed soon\nmany of the Silvan Elves came to be ruled by these Sindar refugees,\nprimarily in Lothlórien and the Woodland Realm.\n\nThe Woodland Realm\n\nThe primarily Silvan Elves of Mirkwood were known to be distrustful of\nDwarves but friendly to Men, with whom they traded. Mirkwood had been\ncalled Greenwood the Great until around the year TA 1050, when the\nshadow of the Dark Lord Sauron fell upon it, and men began to call it\nMirkwood. During his journey to the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo Baggins had\nto rescue the Dwarves of Thorin II Oakenshield's company from these\nElves. These Elves sent hosts to both the War of the Last Alliance\nand the Battle of the Five Armies.\n\nLegolas of the Fellowship of the Ring, although he lived among them was\nnot truly one of the Silvan folk. As a son of the Elven-king Thranduil,\nwhose father Oropher had originally come from Doriath, Legolas was\nlikely actually at least half of Sindarin heritage on his father's side\n(his mother's identity being unknown).\n\nIt is important to note that while by the end of the Third Age, Sindarin\nhad become the primary language of the Woodland Realm, Silvan being\nalmost completely forgotten, that in the early years of the Sindarin\nrule over the Silvan Elves here, the Sindar for a time “deliberately”\nadopted the language and customs of the Silvan Elves, as “they wished to\nreturn to the simple life natural to the elves before the invitation of\nthe Valar had disturbed it”. \n\nLórien\n\nThe Silvan Elves of Lórien were the larger part of the Galadhrim or the\nTree-people, who were a mixture of elves of Nandor, Noldor, and Sindar\ndescent. Most of the Sindar that came to Lórien were refugees from\nBeleriand, arriving early in the Second Age, and the Sinda Amdír became\nthe King of Lórien. After Amdír was killed in the Battle of Dagorlad,\nhis son Amroth became King.\n\nAfter the destruction of Eregion, they were joined by many Sindarin\nspeaking Noldor, led by Galadriel and Celeborn, who fled to Lórien\nthrough Moria. Galadriel was of Noldor descent, being the daughter of\nFinarfin, while Celeborn was of Sindarin descent of the Kingdom of\nDoriath. When Amroth was lost in the Third Age, Galadriel and Celeborn\nbecame known as the Lady and Lord of Lórien, but neither of them took\nthe vacant Kingship.\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring they spoke an accent or dialect of\nSindarin which had changed so much that Frodo Baggins, who spoke some\nSindarin, could not understand them. Additionally, few elves of Lórien\ncould speak Westron, so that Haldir, one of the few that could, had to\naccompany them on their way to Caras Galadhon.\n"

The Doom of Mandos was placed on them so that\nthey could not return to Valinor.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Exiles were split into two groups during the Kinslaying at\nAlqualondë; Fëanor and his sons and followers took the ships they had\nacquired from the Teleri, leaving Fingolfin's followers behind. They had\nto cross the Helcaraxë in the north, and lost a large number of people\nthere. When asked about the course of action they would take to\ntransport the rest of the exiles, Fëanor ordered the burning of the\nships.\n\nMorgoth wasted no time attacking the exiles, which were vastly superior\nto them in spite of their small number and unprepared state.

Amrod\nand Amras joined the Laiquendi of Ossiriand, Finrod built Nargothrond\nand Minas Tirith, and Turgon built Gondolin.\n\nFor hundreds of years, the Ñoldor held off the forces of Morgoth,\ndefeating him in three of the major battle of Beleriand and laying siege\nto his great abode in the north.

They made no weapons of steel, had only bows and\narrows - which they were experts at handling. They dressed in\nforest-like green attire during the spring and summer months, therefore\nbecoming known as the Green-elves. They were also fond of singing during\nthe daylight hours. Their culture remained unique and distinct for many\nhundreds of years as they were for the most part a simple, peaceful, and\nreclusive people.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Laiquendi can be traced to the Telerin Elves of the host of Olwë,\nwho coming upon the Great River Anduin and seeing the seemingly\nimpassable peaks of the Misty Mountains, forsook the westward journey\nand became a separated people. These Elves followed Lenwë down the banks\nof the Anduin and once again became separated. The fate of many of these\nelves is uncertain; what is certain though is that some wandered into\nEriador making contact with the Dwarves, probably learning from them\nabout the great Sindarin King Thingol ruling peaceful territories in the\nrich lands of the Beleriand, prompting them to cross the Blue Mountains.\nFollowing their King Denethor, they made permanent settlement in the\nOssiriand, which was after named Lindon, or _Land of the singers_ after\nthese elves. They quickly made friends with Thingol, who recognized them\nas long lost kin of old.\n\nMorgoth, returning to Middle-earth with the Silmarils before his\npursuers the Ñoldor, quickly occupied his strongholds of old in the far\nnorth and resumed his plans for conquest. He invaded the Beleriand.\nSeeking aid, Thingol called on the Laiquendi and Denethor answered\nleading an army against their enemy’s eastern host, but were driven off\nand surrounded at Amon Ereb before they could be rescued by Thingol's\narmy. Their simplistic weapons were little to no match for the servants\nand beasts of Morgoth, thus they suffered heavy losses and Denethor was\nslain.

After some time, they were summoned by Oromë to\nlive with the Valar in Aman.

Tolkien.\n\nIt follows, and is always published separately from, Part One.\n\n\nContent\n\n_The Book of Lost Tales_ contains the first versions of the stories\nwhich would later become _The Silmarillion_, and is notable because,\nwhile very primitive in style and content, it is very close to the later\nwork in many ways. Each of the Tales is followed by notes and a detailed\ncommentary by Christopher Tolkien.\n\nWhile many of the names in the book are identical or close to those in\nthe later versions, some of them bear almost no resemblance to their\nfinal forms. J.R.R. Tolkien emended names of characters and places\nrather frequently, sometimes with several new variants (rejected in\nturn) written in a single manuscript. Confusingly, sometimes the name\napplied to one thing is later used to refer to a different thing, the\noriginal use abandoned. As an example, the house of Elves called\n“Teleri” in _The Book of Lost Tales_ is not the same as that in _The\nSilmarillion_ (see Teleri). The original usage of “Teleri” would\neventually change until the name became “Vanyar”. Meanwhile, the house\nof Elves called “Solosimpi” would inherit the name “Teleri”.\n\nThe framework for the book is that a mortal Man visits the Isle of Tol\nEressëa, where the Elves live. In the earlier versions of the “Lost\nTales” this man is named Eriol, of some vague north European origin, but\nin later versions he becomes Ælfwine, an Englishman of the Middle-ages.\n\nThere are more changes visible within the book, and it is not internally\nconsistent, partially because even while still writing it Tolkien began\nrewriting earlier parts as his ideas about the world changed. The Tales\nwere eventually abandoned, but they were resurrected in part as the\n“Sketch of the Mythology” which would become _The Silmarillion_.\n\nFor publication the book was split into two volumes: _The Book of Lost\nTales Part One_ and _The Book of Lost Tales Part Two_, but this is\nsimply an editorial division. Both volumes are comprised of several\n“Lost Tales”, which can be considered as either chapters or simply\n“parts”.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1.  “The Tale of Tinúviel” — the first version of the tale of Beren and\n    Lúthien\n2.  “Turambar and the Foalókë” — the first version of the Túrin saga\n3.  “The Fall of Gondolin” — the full narrative of the Fall of Gondolin\n4.  “The Nauglafring” — a story which was “lost” (in that it never was\n    rewritten in full) and mostly excluded from the later\n    _Silmarillion_.\n5.  “The Tale of Eärendel” — the only full narrative of Eärendil's\n    travels\n6.  “The History of Eriol or Ælfwine and the End of the Tales” — an\n    essay about the changes in the framework, and the “unwritten” tales"

Although Tolkien abandoned both\nof these before their respective ends, they are both long enough to\noccupy many stanzas, each of which can last for over ten pages.\n\nThe first tale is in alliterative verse, and the second is in rhyming\ncouplets. Both exist in two versions. In addition to these two poems,\nthe book also gives some shorter, soon abandoned poems.\n\nThe first versions of the long lays fit chronologically in with\nTolkien's earliest writings, as recounted in _The Book of Lost Tales_,\nbut the later versions are contemporary with the writing of _The Lord of\nthe Rings_."

    "text": "The_' Haradrim, KNOWN IN WESTRON AS THE Southrons_' and once as the\n“SWERTINGS” by Hobbits, were a race of Men from Harad in the region of\nMiddle-earth directly south of Gondor. A part of the histories of the\nWestlands is given to the fierce people who in the Second and the Third\nAge of the Sun, came from the hot deserts and forests of sunlands, which\nlay in the South of Middle-earth. These people were ruled by many and\nlords, until in time Sauron the Maia corrupted them and called them to\nwar.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the Second Age the Men of Númenor built a great city in the firth\nof Umbar, a vast natural harbour on the southern shores of the Bay of\nBelfalas, eventually turning the city into a fortified citadel from\nwhose gates the Men of Númenor could levy great tributes upon many of\nthe tribes of Harad.\n\nFor many years, the Haradrim were the greatest enemy of Gondor. Several\ntimes, they invaded the north. Finally, the Men of Gondor were able to\ncapture Harad, though it was later freed. During the War of the Ring the\nHaradrim were allied with Sauron. A Haradrim warrior wounded Faramir. At\nthe Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the 18,000 Haradrim were a great\nthreat to the Rohirrim that had come to aid the people of Minas Tirith.\nDuring the onslaught a Haradrim chieftain, who bore the standard of a\nblack serpent on a scarlet field, led the Haradrim cavalry. King Théoden\nof Rohan slew him in single combat.\n\nOnce Sauron was destroyed, the Haradrim, Variags, and Easterlings\ndisbanded from the Black Gates and out of Mordor, and became dispersed.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _HARADRIM_ means “South-people”, from the Sindarin _harad_\n(“south”) and _rim_ (“host, group”).\n\nOther names were SOUTHERNS, SOUTHRONS.\n\n\nTraits and culture\n\nThe Haradrim were bold and grim men, fierce in despair. They were tall\nand dark-skinned with black hair and dark eyes, and for that they were\ncalled SWERTINGS or SWARTHY MEN. The men of Near Harad were\nbrown-skinned, with black hair and dark eyes, while the race known as\n“half-trolls” out of Far Harad had black skin.\n\nMany Haradrim warriors were seen in bright clothing, such as scarlet\nrobes, and were decorated with golden ornaments, such as collars,\nearrings, corsets of overlapping brazen plates; they braided their hair\nwith gold. Some tribes painted their bodies. Scarlet and red was also\nthe color of their banners, tips of their spears, and body paint. Their\nshields were yellow and black with spikes. It is also mentioned that\nat the end of the Second Age some of the Men in the south had weapons of\niron. At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Haradrim bore\nscimitars that glittered like stars.\n\nThe Haradrim had tamed the massive _Mûmakil_ beasts and used them in\nwarfare and, like their masters, were decorated with scarlet and gold.\nThey even strapped towers on their backs, used by Haradrim archers and\nspearmen.\n\nHarad's tribes included into those of Near and Far Harad, although there\nwere many tribes of the Haradrim, often mutually hostile. Some of the\npeoples of Far Harad were organized into kingdoms.\n\nLanguage\n\nTo the Gondorians their voices sounded harsh, like shouts of beasts.\n\nThe only word which is stated to come from a southron language is\n“Mûmak”, the name of the great war-oliphaunts of Harad.\n\nGandalf states that his name in “the south” is “Incánus” thought\n_Inkā-nūsh_ (or possibly _Inkā-nūs_), meaning “North-spy”.\n\nDespite having a meaning in Quenya (“fate”), the name Umbar is said to\nbe adapted from the natives' language and not from Elvish or Adûnaic.\n\n\nEnvironment\n\n\n\nThe lands of the Haradrim lie to the south of Gondor past the river\nPoros. In the land south of Gondor, the sun beat down unrelentingly,\ncooking much of Haradwaith into desert.\n\n\nMilitary Tactics\n\n\n\nThe Haradrim are said to be skilled horsemen, though not near the\nprowess of the Rohirrim. They are known to have mounted champions and\narchers, as well as infantry. Horses fear the Mumakil, and so the\nSouthron forces often rally around them when faced with mounted foes.\n\n\nFuture of Harad\n\nMuch of Harad's impressive army was wiped out on the expanses of\nPelennor Fields, during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. With Sauron\ndefeated, many Harad peoples sent emissaries to the court of King\nAragorn, and peace talks began; however, many other Haradrim tribes\ncontinued hostility with Gondor.\n",

Grishnákh soon returned with other\nOrcs like himself, Orcs with drooping arms and shields with the red eye\npainted on them.\n\nGrishnákh was somehow aware of the existence of the One Ring (having\nbeen implied to have participated in the torture of Gollum), and\nsuspected the two Hobbits of possessing it. When the Orcs holding the\ntwo Hobbits were attacked by the banished Éomer's Rohirrim, Grishnákh\nused the distraction to search the Hobbits for the Ring. Pippin tried to\nnegotiate with Grishnákh, asking for himself and Merry to be freed in\nexchange for information about the Ring, but instead Grishnákh tried to\ncarry them away. When it seemed a Rohirrim rider had discovered him,\nGrishnákh drew his sword to kill the Hobbits lest they be rescued or\nescape, but before he could act he was shot in the hand by a Rohirrim\narrow and dropped the sword, at which point he tried to run but was\nridden down and run through with a Rohirrim spear.\n",

He appears only in _The\nHobbit_.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nThe Great Goblin was a Goblin chieftain of the Misty Mountains. He was a\nvery large creature with a huge head. He was the chief of a group of\ngoblins who lived in Goblin-town near the High Pass. They preyed on\ntravellers who used another, easier pass near the main gate of\nGoblin-town until people started avoiding that route over the mountains.\nThe goblins then made another gate that opened into a cave that they\ncalled the Front Porch, at the top of the High Pass. The Great Goblin\nalso sometimes ordered his goblins to catch fish for him in Gollum's\nLake, and these goblins were sometimes killed by Gollum.\n\nIn the summer of TA 2941, the Dwarves of Thorin and Company, along with\nBilbo Baggins, were captured on the Front Porch and were brought before\nthe Great Goblin in his great cave, where he was seated on a flat stone\nand surrounded by armed guards. The Great Goblin demanded to know what\nthe Dwarves were doing in the mountains. (He seems less hostile in this\npassage than the Orcs are during the later War of the Ring, as his\nquestioning seems to imply that he has not decided beforehand whether he\nwill order the party killed, make them slaves, or even let them go, but\nthat he will decide according to their answers. It is also possible he\nwas just toying with the group and would kill them afterwards.)\n\n\n\nWhen it was revealed that Thorin carried the Elvish sword Orcrist -\nwhich the Orcs and goblins fear and which they called “Biter” - the\nGreat Goblin was enraged and at once leapt to attack Thorin.\nImmediately, all the torches in the cave were extinguished and a glowing\nsword “bright as blue flame” appeared. It was Glamdring, called “Beater”\nby the goblins, and now wielded by Gandalf. As the Dwarves were\nescaping, the Great Goblin leapt down in front of them, and attacked\nGandalf who was at the head of the party. Gandalf then fought back,\nstabbing the Great Goblin and killing him.\n\nThe death of the Great Goblin angered the goblins of the Misty\nMountains. A great army of goblins and Wargs was amassed by Bolg, whose\nfather Azog had been killed by the dwarf Dáin II Ironfoot. Bolg's forces\ntracked Thorin and Company to the Lonely Mountain where they fought in\nthe Battle of the Five Armies against the Dwarves, Elves, and\nLakemen.\n",

    "text": "RANGERS OF THE NORTH, or simply THE RANGERS, were the northern\nwandering people of Eriador, the last remnant of the Dúnedain of Arnor,\nwho had once peopled the North Kingdom of Arnor. They protected the\nlands they wandered although their secretiveness made other peoples\nconsider them dangerous and distrustful in Bree and the Shire, where\nthey were known as “Watchers”.\n\nThey were grim in appearance and were usually dressed in grey or dark\ngreen, with a cloak-clasp shaped like a 6-pointed star.\n\nThe term 'Rangers of the North' was used most often by those who lived\nin the southern lands of Rohan and Gondor, perhaps to distinguish this\npeople from their distant cousins, the Rangers of Ithilien. Like the\nRangers of the North, these were also Dúnedain, but they belonged to the\nSouth-kingdom of Gondor, and their ancestors had been divided from the\nNorthern Dúnedain for some three thousand years.\n\n\nBackground\n\n The Dúnedain of\nArnor dwindled after the breaking of Arnor into three kingdoms and the\nwars with Angmar. Cardolan and Rhudaur soon fell and only the\npetty-kingdom of Arthedain maintained the noble line of Isildur.\nFinally, that too was destroyed in the Battle of Fornost and Arvedui,\nthe last King of Arthedain was lost in the sea.\n\nArvedui's son and heir, Aranarth claimed the title of the Chieftain, who\nwould rule the remnants of his people. Elrond had in his keeping the\nheirlooms of the house of Isildur: the shards of Narsil, the Star of\nElendil, the Sceptre of Annúminas and later the Ring of Barahir,\nransomed from the Lossoth.\n\nEach of Aranarth's heirs (who, like him, could trace his descent back to\nIsildur himself) would be secretly born and raised in Rivendell.\n\nThe Rangers became a secretive wandering and nomadic people around\nEriador, far from Sauron's spies, little known or remembered, and their\ndeeds were seldom recorded.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Watchful Peace followed the loss of Arnor and after its end, the\nenemies concentrated mostly against Rhovanion and Gondor. During that\ntime, the Rangers fought minor battles and skirmishes against orcs and\nwolves in order to keep the region safe. The hobbits of the Shire\nflourished under their protection.\n\nDuring the rule of Arassuil, the Orcs of the Misty Mountains became more\nbold, daring to invade Eriador. The Rangers fought many battles trying\nto hold them back, but one party managed to reach the Shire, and were\nfought off by a party of brave Hobbits under Bandobras Took in T.A.\n2747. Soon after, the Long Winter arrived and many lives were lost, and\nGandalf and the Rangers had to help the Hobbits of the Shire survive.\n\nIn 2911, during Argonui's rule, the Fell Winter began with the\nBrandywine freezing over. This was a catalyst for White Wolves invading\nEriador from the North which must have harassed the Rangers. In the last\nyear of his reign, great floods devastated Enedwaith and Minhiriath\nleaving Tharbad ruined and deserted. The following years were peaceful\nalthough Arador was killed by hill-trolls and his son Arathorn II was\nkilled while hunting orcs.\n\nArathorn's son, Aragorn II succeeded him, who between 2957 to 2980 took\ngreat journeys, serving in the armies of King Thengel of Rohan, and\nSteward Ecthelion II of Gondor. Many of his tasks weakened Sauron and\nhis allies, and the West endured him during the War of the Ring.\n\nAt that time Aragorn's Rangers were scattered and diminished. When\nHalbarad led a troop of the Rangers into the south to Aragorn's aid in\nthe War, in haste he could muster no more than thirty in this company\nwho fought in the Battle of Pelennor Fields.\n\nAragorn eventually became King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom and the\nRangers became once more a united people under the line of Elendil in\nthe Fourth Age.\n\nFor over a thousand years, the Rangers of the North faithfully preserved\nthe Line of Elendil and the ways of the Dúnedain and the ancient\nheirlooms of the Heir of Isildur such as the Shards of Narsil, Star of\nElendil, Sceptre of Annúminas, and the Ring of Barahir. Like all\nDúnedain, they were very friendly with the Elves, particularly those of\nRivendell, where each heir would be born and raised. They secretly\nguarded and protected Eriador, from spies and invaders, brigands, and\nother worse foes.\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring, the Rangers of the North were led by\nAragorn, future king of the reunited kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor. But\ndespite Aragorn's leadership, most of the Rangers remained scattered and\ndiminished. Therefore, when the ranger Halbarad endeavored to aid\nAragorn in the War, he could muster only a small number of Rangers to\njoin him."

However it is possible that Scatha was a\nremnant of the dragons of Morgoth that fled into Northeast after the War\nof Wrath at the end of the First Age. It is not certain whether Scatha\nwas the dragon which killed Dain I and his son Frór.\n\n\n\nHe appeared in the Third Age, and his lair was in the southern slopes of\nthe Grey Mountains. He greatly troubled the Dwarves and Men living in\nthe lands North of the Wilderland and had stolen a great deal of their\ntreasure. He was slain by the Éothéod leader Fram, son of Frumgar (an\nancestor of Eorl the Young) in the early days of the Éothéod (roughly TA\n2000).\n\nAfter Scatha's demise, peace came to the land save for a dispute over\nhis stolen treasure. In his hoard was found a silver horn, the Horn of\nRohan later given to Meriadoc Brandybuck by Éowyn. The Dwarves also\nclaimed the horn (partially justified as the Horn of Rohan was said to\nbe Dwarven make) but Fram would not give them anything. Instead, Fram\nsent them a necklace made out of Scatha's teeth. The Dwarves were\ninsulted and may have slain him and took what they wanted.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis name was likely taken from Anglo-Saxon _sceaða_, “injurious person,\ncriminal, thief, assassin”.\n\n\nSpeculations\n\n-   It is likely that Scatha was not the one responsible for death of\n    Dain I as Scatha was killed in TA 2000, long before the Dain's\n    incident happened in TA 2589. Thus, Scatha could or could not be a\n    fire-breathing one.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   It's possible, as a flightless dragon, that Scatha participated in\n    the attack on Gondolin and looted the city after its fall. Thus the\n    Elvish swords, Glamdring, Orcrist, and Sting, may have been part of\n    the hoard that Fram now possessed.\n\n\nGallery",

The first battle took place on February 25, 3019. The second\nwas on March 2, 3019.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThéodred, son of King Théoden of Rohan, was alerted by his scouts to the\nmustering taking place in Isengard. He manned both sides of the ford and\nwent forward leaving three companies of riders to guard the eastern\nside. Early in the morning, he crossed over to the western side with a\nforce mainly consisting of archers and cavalry. He planned to take the\nforces of Uruk-hai by surprise.\n\nHowever, Saruman had tricked the scouts; his army was already marching\nout to attack the ford. Twenty miles to the north of the ford, Théodred\nencountered the vanguard of the Uruk-hai and quickly cut through their\nlines. He then charged at the main force,\nwhich were prepared for the attack and were stationed behind trenches\nplanted with pikes. Reinforcements came out of Isengard and outflanked\nthe cavalry, nearly surrounding them. Hastily Théodred ordered a\nretreat, but the Uruk-hai could not be shaken off that easily. Grimbold,\nwho was in command of the Rohirrim rearguard, had to cut down their\npursuers many times.\n\nSaruman's eastern force was much smaller but more dangerous. It\ncontained Dunlendings, Warg riders and Uruk-hai. The Rohirrim guard on\nthe eastern side of the ford had been driven into retreat, and their\nattackers recrossed the ford to attack Théodred on both sides. Théodred\nand his men had dismounted on a small islet to cover Grimbold's retreat.\nAt the same time Grimbold's force was being attacked from the western\nside, and as Grimbold looked east, he saw Théodred's force being driven\nfrom the islet to a hill. Grimbold and a few men raced toward Théodred's\nposition. Théodred was cutting his way through the Uruk-hai lines. But\nby the time Grimbold reached him, Théodred had fallen, cut down by a\ngiant Orc. Grimbold slew the Orc and then found himself defending\nThéodred's body from enemies. He himself would have been cut down had it\nnot been for Elfhelm.\n\nElfhelm had been leading four companies towards Helm's Deep, when it was\nreported to him that two Warg riders had been spotted. He rode at full\nspeed to the ford and, seeing the situation, ordered his men to charge.\nBefore long his men held the western side of the ford. They then charged\non the islet. From this surprise attack most of the Uruk-hai retreated\ntoward Isengard. When they reached the islet they found Grimbold\ndefending Théodred's body against two huge Orcs. Elfhelm rushed to his\naid and felled one enemy while Grimbold slew the other.\n\nWhen they lifted Théodred's body, they found he was still alive. He\nlived long enough to say, “Let me lie here -to keep the ford until Éomer\ncomes.” The enemy attack ended by nightfall. The Rohirrim had held the\nford but suffered heavy losses.\n",

Several members of\nthis council would also become prominent members of the Council in the\nThird Age.\n\nDuring the Third Age\n\n The White Council's head\nwas the Wizard Saruman the White, (although Lady Galadriel wished for\nGandalf the Grey to be made the leader of the group). Other members of\nthe Council included the Bearers of the Three Rings of the Elves\n(Gandalf, Galadriel, and Elrond Half-elven), Círdan the Shipwright (who\nhad borne Narya, the Ring of Fire, before handing it on to Gandalf),\nLord Glorfindel, and Radagast the Brown. It is assumed that others of\nthe wise were also members of the White Council.\n\n The White Council was formed in TA\n2463 shortly after the end of the Watchful Peace. In TA 2851 the\nWhite Council met to decide on whether to act on Gandalf's discovery\nthat the Necromancer was actually Sauron and was at Dol Guldur, but\nSaruman dissuaded the others from taking action, claiming that the Dark\nLord was defeated and could not regain his full strength. During this\nmeeting Gandalf suspected Saruman of desiring to have the One Ring, and\nthere was much tension between the two. However, in TA 2939, Saruman\ndiscovered that Sauron's servants were searching the Anduin near Gladden\nFields, and that Sauron therefore had learned where Isildur had died and\nwhere the One Ring might be. Saruman did not inform the Council of this,\nbut when they met again in TA 2941 Saruman finally agreed to an attack\non Dol Guldur because he wanted to prevent Sauron from finding the Ring.\nSauron was driven out of Dol Guldur, only to re-appear in Mordor in\n2951, where he declared himself openly and began gathering power. The\nCouncil last met in TA 2953; at this meeting Saruman falsely claimed\nthat the One Ring has been swept out into the sea. Afterward Saruman\nwithdrew to Isengard, and fortified it.\n"

    "text": "The AINUR, also known as the HOLY ONES, are beings encompassing both the\nValar and the Maiar. They were the first and mightiest beings created by\nEru Ilúvatar in the depths of time before the beginning of the World.\n\nThey were primordial spirits who existed with Ilúvatar, and with him\ncreated the world through the '''Ainulindalë, '''the MUSIC OF THE AINUR.\nAfter the creation of Arda, many of the Ainur descended into it to guide\nand order its growth; of these there were fifteen more powerful than the\nrest. Fourteen of these great Ainur became known as the Valar, or Powers\nof Arda. The fifteenth, Melkor, turned aside from that path and became\nthe first Dark Lord. The many lesser Ainur that accompanied the Valar\ninto Arda are known as Maiar.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOrigin\n\nThe Ainur were the 'offspring of Ilúvatar's thought' and each was given\nunderstanding only of that part of the mind of Ilúvatar from which he or\nshe came. The exception to this was Melkor, a brother in spirit to\nManwë, who later became The Lord of the Valar and he was given some of\nthe parts from which the others had come, but for all his gifts he did\nnot know the full mind of Eru. Melkor and Manwë were the most powerful\nof the Ainur.\n\nThe Ainur were 'kindled with the Flame Imperishable', which can be taken\nto mean that they were granted free will by their Creator. Ilúvatar\ninstructed them in the arts of music, until he brought them together to\nmake the Music of the Ainur: the great song that created the Vision of\nIlúvatar and ultimately the real world. In the beginning of the Music,\nthe Ainur were all in harmony with Eru and one another, but Melkor\nturned instead to his own pride, seeking power for himself and bringing\ndiscord to the Great Music. He later led many of the Maiar astray as\nwell.\n\n\nThe Ainur and the World\n\nThrough the Music of the Ainur, Ilúvatar created a Vision of the World;\nhe showed it to the Ainur, and explained much of its nature and destiny\nto them - the Ainur therefore have much knowledge of the World, but are\nnot themselves omniscient. Ilúvatar then granted the World true being by\ndeclaring “Eä”, causing these visions to come into being. Melkor and\nmany of the other mighty Ainur desired to descend into it and form it in\nreadiness for the coming of the Children of Ilúvatar (that is, Elves and\nMen).  Upon descending into the World, the Ainur became known as the\nValar and the Maiar.\n\nThose Ainur who entered the World and chose to live in it at its\nbeginning remain bound to it until its end. Though Melkor was eventually\nthrown into the Void by the others, he is prophesied to return before\nthe end in the DAGOR DAGORATH, the final battle. Little is known of the\nultimate future of the Ainur, even by themselves, but it is said that\nafter the great battle at the end of the World, they will make a Second,\neven greater Music with the Children of Ilúvatar.\n\n\nThe Line of Melian\n\nAmong the many Ainur who entered the World long ago, there was one of\nthe order of the Maiar named Melian. Alone of all the Ainur, she wedded\none of the Children of Ilúvatar, King Elu Thingol of Doriath, and wove\nthe Girdle of Melian that protected Doriath for many centuries. Through\nher, an essence of the Ainur entered the bloodlines of the Elves and\nMen, passed down through generation after generation, and was still\npresent at the time of the War of the Ring. Elrond was Melian's\ngreat-great-grandson, and Aragorn, too, was her descendant, though\nthrough many more generations than Elrond.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nAINUR is a Quenyan word originating from Valarin and means “Holy ones”.\nIt appears to come from the word AINA, meaning 'holy'. Although the\norigin of the second element '''ur '''is less clear, it is possible\nthere is a link between the word 'Ainur' and the word 'Eru' as the first\nelement 'er' means 'one', though this may not be true as there is no\nfurther elaboration on this.\n\nThe singular form of Ainur is AINU, simply meaning “Holy one”.\n",

    "text": "The DAGOR BRAGOLLACH or BATTLE OF THE SUDDEN FLAME was the fourth of the\ngreat battles of the War of the Jewels. It marked the end of the Siege\nof Angband and beginning of Morgoth's gains against the Elves and Men of\nthe Beleriand.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\n\n\nFor four hundred years after Dagor Aglareb the Ñoldor had managed to\ncontain Morgoth's power inside Angband. Peace and prosperity reigned in\nBeleriand, to the point where green grass grew even to the very doors of\nAngband. The strength of the Elven kingdoms, and that of their Edain\nallies, became such that Fingolfin, High King of the Ñoldor, believed\nthat the siege would last forever. But though the Elves and Edain had\nmanaged to contain Morgoth's forces, it was beyond their power to\nassault Angband or to overthrow the power of Morgoth. As such, the Dark\nLord labored undisturbed in Angband during the siege, breeding countless\nlegions of Orcs and other evil creatures, as well creating the first\nDragon. He intended to use this new, unprecedentedly powerful force to\nutterly destroy those who had opposed him. However, in the furious haste\nof his malice, he decided to strike before his designs were complete,\ncynically underestimating the valor of the Elves, and not accounting for\nthe Edain at all. This haste was credited as the reason why resistance\nagainst Morgoth was able to continue after the conclusion of the\nconflict; for if Morgoth had waited for a short time longer to complete\nthe buildup of his forces, his foes would have been annihilated.\n\nOn a cold winter's night when the Elven watch was at its least vigilant,\nMorgoth sent out rivers of flame and poisonous fumes from Thangorodrim\nand the Iron Mountains. The plains of Ard-galen were consumed by the\nfire and transformed into a barren desert which was renamed\nAnfauglith, “the Gasping Dust”. The Elves had never faced an assault of\nthis sort before, and many perished as they fled from these flames.\nBehind them came the Balrogs, Glaurung the Father of Dragons, and\nlegions of Orcs in such numbers as the Elves had never imagined.\nMorgoth's primary aim was an onslaught so rapid that the various\nkingdoms of the Elves would not be able to consolidate their forces or\ncome to each others aid. And so it was that each of the Elven kingdoms\nhad to fight Morgoth's forces on their own. The Orcs quickly overran the\nhighlands of Dorthonion, and slew Angrod and Aegnor. Maglor's horsemen\nwere burnt alive on the plain of Lothlann, and Maglor's Gap was taken,\ngiving Morgoth an entry into Beleriand. Maglor retreated with heavy\nlosses to Himring, where he helped defend the city of Maedhros. Though\ngrievously besieged, the heavily fortified city did not fall, and\nMaedhros himself accomplished deeds of surpassing valor during the\nfighting.\n\nThe Pass of Aglon was also breached, and Celegorm and Curufin fled north\nof Doriath to Nargothrond. Morgoth's Orcs took the mountain forests of\nMount Rerir, and defiled Lake Helevorn, scattering south through\nThargelion into East Beleriand. Caranthir fled to Amon Ereb, where he\nand Amrod built defenses. From there they slowly freed East Beleriand of\nthe Orcs, while Maglor and Maedhros held the northern border.\nEventually, Maedhros even managed to re-secure the Pass of Aglon,\ndenying the forces of Morgoth continued entry into Beleriand from that\nroute.\n\n\n\nMinas Tirith in the Pass of Sirion in the West under Orodreth held, and\nOrodreth's uncle and Lord Finrod Felagund came north from Nargothrond\nwith a large army. However, they were ambushed by a huge number of\nMorgoth's forces at the Fen of Serech. The Noldor found themselves\ntrapped, and Finrod would have been killed or taken but for a sortie by\nBarahir and his men, who descended from Dorthonion and rescued the Elven\nlord. The cost in lives was heavy, but Finrod escaped the Orcs. In\nprofound gratitude, Finrod gave Barahir his ring, which would become\nknown as the Ring of Barahir, and pledged that he would aid Barahir and\nhis kin in any time of need.\n\nFinrod and his folk fled south to Nargothrond, while Barahir continued\ndefending Dorthonion until both his forces and his people dwindled to\nnothing. The mountain forts of the Ered Wethrin around Hithlum were\nheavily assaulted but managed barely to hold, as the mountains\nthemselves provided protection from the fires Morgoth had released from\nThangorodrim.\n\nThus the Siege was broken, the Sons of Fëanor scattered, and the forces\nof Morgoth roamed at will throughout the north.\n\nWhen Fingolfin, the High King of the Ñoldor, learned of the heavy\ncasualties of so many Ñoldor, he rode in wrath across the dust of\nAnfauglith to Angband and challenged Morgoth to single combat. At the\ndoors of Angband itself, they fought a great duel, and Fingolfin wounded\nMorgoth seven times. Yet, Fingolfin was ultimately no match for the Dark\nLord and was crushed beneath Morgoth's foot, but not before stabbing\nMorgoth in the heel with his last stroke. Thorondor, king of the Great\nEagles, then swooped down and retrieved Fingolfin's body and scarred\nMorgoth's face. Though Morgoth's wounds would never heal and he was left\nwith a permanent limp, Morgoth and his forces were nevertheless\nvictorious.\n\nStill, Morgoth was cautious. For though he had won a great victory, his\nfoes had inflicted upon him loss as great as their own. As his initial\nonslaught had abated, his foes had begun to recover, making small\nadvances into the fringes of the territory he had conquered. He had not\nexpected the Elves to resist him so strongly, and the aid of their Edain\nallies had been a completely unforeseen variable in his plans. As such,\nhe checked his assault and recalled the main host of the Orcs to\nAngband.\n\nTwo years after Morgoth's onslaught abated, the isle of Tol Sirion, held\nby Orodreth brother of Finrod, came under assault by Morgoth's most\nterrible servant, Sauron. His coming caused a dark cloud of fear to grip\nthe hearts and wills of the defenders, and the watchtower of Minas\nTirith upon the isle was taken. This secured for Morgoth the western\npass of the river Sirion. After another five years had passed, Morgoth\nrenewed his assault against Hithlum and very nearly destroyed it.\nFortunately for Fingon, now High King of the Ñoldor, his forces were\nreinforced by a host under the command of Círdan, and the Orcs were\nrepelled.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_DAGOR BRAGOLLACH_ is Sindarin for 'Battle of Sudden Flame'.",

    "page_id": "2355",
    "text": "DORIATH (Sindarin IPA: ) (aka ARTANOR\") was an Elven realm, the land\nof the Sindar that existed during the latter-half of the Years of the\nTrees and most of the First Age of the Sun. For thousands of years it\nwas separate from the outside world under the rule of King Thingol and\nthe protection of his wife Melian the Maia, until it was drawn into the\nwar against Morgoth and the doom that lay on the Ñoldor, because of the\nOath of Fëanor.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nDoriath was located in the middle of Beleriand, between Ered Gorgoroth\n(Mountains of Terror) from the north and the Andram from south, and\nTalath Dirnen from the west, and Estolad from the east. It was a realm\nof forests about the great river Sirion; within it were the forests\n_Neldoreth_ (also _Taur-na-Neldor_, the northern beech forest), _Nivrim_\n(also West-march, an oak forest), and _Region_ (pronounced Reh-gi-on,\nthe main forest). Additionally, the forests of _Brethil_ and ''Nan\nElmoth ''were considered to be under the influence of Thingol, though\nnot under his direct command and laying outside of the Girdle of Melian.\nEöl the Dark Elf leased Nan Elmoth from Thingol, having paid with the\nsword Anglachel. The People of Haleth, or the Haladin, lived in Brethil\nwith the permission of Thingol. They governed themselves, but cooperated\nwith the march-wardens of Doriath. King Elu Thingol of Doriath, also\nHigh King of the Sindar, saw all of Beleriand as his realm, from the\nGelion to the Belegaer (the Sea).\n\n\nHistory\n\nYears of the Trees\n\nThe Vanyar and Ñoldor had passed by it on the Great Journey, and had\nbeen ferried across on Tol Eressëa by the time the Teleri arrived. Then\ntheir lord Elwë was lost in Nan Elmoth, and when Ulmo returned for them,\na part remained behind. They became known as the Sindar or Grey Elves,\nand when Thingol returned he became their king, ruling from Doriath.\n\nThe forests of Neldoreth and Region were located in the center of\nBeleriand, and were the abode of King Thingol and Melian. Their people\nwere the people of the Teleri who did not heed the call of the Valar to\npass over the sea to Valinor. All the Elves of Beleriand, from the\nshipbuilders under Círdan in the Falas, to the hunters of the Blue\nMountains, held Thingol as their lord. During the First and Second Ages\nof the Chaining of Melkor, Beleriand was peaceful. However, by the end\nof the First Age, Melian forebode that evil was to come, and Thingol\ncalled on the aid of the Dwarves of Belegost to aid in constructing a\ncity-fortress for the protection of his people. They also helped make\nfor them a store of stronger and better weapons that were better able to\ndeal with the Orcs of north. This was built under ground along the\nsouthern side of the River Esgalduin, and was called Menegroth, which\nbecame Thingol's capital.\n\nFor the most part, the Elves lived in scattered bands throughout\nBeleriand, only gathering in larger numbers in Neldoreth and Region\n(together called Eglador), and along the Falas. During the Third Age of\nthe Chaining of Melkor, Thingol proceeded to arm his people with the aid\nof the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost against the continued foreboding\nof Melian.\n\nAfter Melkor's release, his attack on the Two Trees with Ungoliant, and\nflight to Middle-earth, the situation for Beleriand suddenly worsened.\nUngoliant fled south from the Balrogs after her confrontation with\nMelkor, now Morgoth, and was only checked by the power of Melian. Some\ntime after, the forces of Morgoth left the freshly delved Angband and\nassaulted Beleriand from east and west in the First Battle of Beleriand.\nIn the east, King Thingol lead the forces of Beleriand, with the aid of\nDenethor and his Nandor and elves from Ossiriand, and completely\ndefeated the Orcs of the eastern army. Denethor was killed on Amon Ereb,\nand some of his people merged themselves to the Sindarin Elves under\nKing Thingol. Upon returning to Menegroth, Thingol learned that the\nwestern army of Morgoth had overrun the Falas. Thingol recalls all of\nhis people he can into Neldoreth and Region, and Melian puts forth her\npower and rings the region in a girdle of enchantment called the Girdle\nof Melian. At that point, the region formally called Eglador comes to be\nformally known as Doriath, the Guarded Kingdom.\n\nThe First Battle is the only time King Thingol leads his forces into\nbattle outside of his realm for the entirety of the First Age of the\nSun. Afterwards, the Elves of Doriath fight defensively, guarding their\nborders and the important river crossings nearby.\n\nFirst Age\n\n\n\nWhen the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth at the beginning of the First\nAge, Thingol refused to allow them in Doriath, with the exception of the\nchildren of Finarfin, who were related to him by his brother Olwë.\n\nWhen later Men arrived in Beleriand, they were also refused entry, but\nat Finrod's request the Haladin gives his permission for the People of\nHaleth to dwell in Brethil, who ally themselves with Doriath and aid\nthem in its defense.\n\nThroughout the rest of the First Age, while the Noldor fight their wars\nwith Morgoth, Doriath stands inviolate and generally aloof, refusing to\ntake part in the wars. Ultimately, however, King Thingol is pulled into\nthe doom surround the Noldor as was told in the Lay of Leithian, when\nBeren, son of Barahir and lord of the First House of Men, passed through\nthe Girdle as Melian had foretold, and arrived in Neldoreth.\n\nRealizing that his beloved daughter Lúthien had fallen in love with him,\nKing Thingol decreed that he would not allow them to marry unless Beren\nwould undertake a quest to recover a Silmaril from the Dark Lord\nMorgoth, and so begins the Quest for the Silmarils. After the Quest for\nthe Silmaril, the Wolf Carcharoth also breached the Girdle, but Thingol,\nBeren, and Thingol's captains Beleg and Mablung hunted and killed the\nbeast.\n\nAt the end of this, Thingol ended up in possession of one of the\nSilmarils. Beren and Lúthien, wedded together by fate and returning from\nthe dead, left Doriath to live in Ossiriand. After the Nirnaeth\nArnoediad, only three elven kingdoms remained: Nargothrond, Gondolin,\nand Doriath. Nargothrond fell soon after, as told in the _Narn i Chîn\nHúrin_ (Tale of the Children of Hurin).\n\nFearing that the cruel Easterlings would enthrall her only\nson Túrin of Hithlum, Morwen sent him to Doriath where he would be safe\nuntil he came of age, when he fled from the land. Later his mother and\nsister, Morwen and Nienor lived there, until they were lost.\n\nHurin, captured at the Nirnaeth and released from Angband after the\ndeath of his son Turin, recovers the Nauglamir from the ruin of\nNargothrond. Traveling to Doriath, he throws it at the feet of Thingol\nin spite. Melian rebukes him, and Hurin, cured of the madness of Morgoth\nby Melian, lifts up the Nauglamir and presents it to Thingol before\nleaving Doriath, and vanishing from history.\n\nFall of Doriath\n\nHúrin brought the treasure of Nargothrond to Doriath after the fall of\nFinrod's realm, and Thingol enlisted the Dwarves of Nogrod to combine\nthe Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien with the Nauglamir, the Dwarves'\nNecklace. The Dwarves then attacked Thingol and slew him, stealing the\nnecklace, during the first Sack of Doriath. Melian then left, and with\nher, the protective Girdle thus ended the bliss of old that reigned in\nDoriath for thousands of years, and things would never be the same\nagain.\n\nThingol, in possession of the greatest work of the Elves (a Silmaril of\nFëanor) and Dwarves (the Nauglamir) decides to merge the two. He\nconvinces a large company of smiths from Nogrod to attempt to remake the\nNauglamir to incorporate the Silmaril, which they succeed in doing. Once\nthe work is complete, and the joint works of Elves and Dwarves sits\nglittering before Thingol, he moves to take it and put it on. The\nDwarves stop him, demanding it in payment. Thingol rebukes them with\nhaughty words, at which the Dwarves slay him. The Dwarves attempt to\nescape Doriath, but most are killed and the Nauglamir recovered. After\nThingol's death, Melian departs Doriath in grief and withdraws her power\nfrom Doriath. After telling Mablung to send word to Beren, she vanishes\nfrom Middle-earth and returns to Valinor. Doriath now lies\nundefended.\n\nTwo Dwarves return from Doriath and tell a twisted version of the events\nto their king in Nogrod. The Dwarves of Nogrod raise an army and assault\nDoriath in retaliation. The slaughter is great on both sides, but the\nDwarves end up victorious. Menegroth is ransacked, many of its people\nare killed, and the Dwarves begin the long trek for home laden with the\nspoils of war, including the Nauglamir. At Sarn Athrad, they are\nassaulted by a force of Green Elves led by Beren who, with the aid of\nthe Ents of Ossiriand, annihilate the Dwarven force and recover the\nSilmaril.\n\nDior Eluchîl, son of Beren and Lúthien and heir to Thingol, returns to\nDoriath with his wife Nimloth, their two sons Eluréd and Elurín, and\ntheir daughter Elwing. He begins to rebuild the fortunes of the kingdom\nand it is briefly restored. Beren takes the Nauglamir to Lúthien, who\nwears it, enriching their home on Tol Galen. However, Beren and Lúthien\nsoon die for the second time, leaving the world forever. The Nauglamir\nand its Silmaril are brought to Dior.\n\nSoon after, the Sons of Fëanor, following the Oath, demand the return of\nthe Silmaril. Dior refuses, and the Sons of Fëanor invade Doriath, at\nwhich point the Second Kinslaying occurs. Celegorm, Curufin, and\nCaranthir are killed, as is Dior, Nimloth, and Eluréd and Elurín. The\npeople of Doriath are killed or scattered, with Elwing taking the\nNauglamir and fleeing with a remnant of the people of Doriath to the\nMouths of Sirion.\n\nDoriath was never rebuilt and afterwards Doriath remained abandoned and\nunpopulated until it was sunk along with most of the rest of\nBeleriand.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Sindarin, _Doriath_ means “Land of the Fence”, from _dôr_ (“land”)\nand _iâth_ (“fence”). Its previous name _EGLADOR_ either means “Land of\nthe Forsaken” or “Land of the Elves”, because the inhabitants called\nthemselves “Eglath”. The High Elves called Doriath the “Land of the\nCave”, from the Ñoldorin _gath_ or _gatta_ (“cavern”)\n\n_GARTHÚRIAN_ was name ascribed to the land of Doriath in earlier\nversions of the accounts of the First Age (specifically in _The War of\nthe Jewels_)_._",

    "text": "The '''Vanyar '''(Quenya; IPA: ; singular VANYA; adjectival VANYARIN; ),\nalso called the FAIR ELVES, '''Light-elves ''', and 'SPEAR-ELVES'\n, were the first and smallest of the Kindreds of the Eldar. Under the\nleadership of Ingwë, the Vanyar were the first to set forth on the Great\nJourney and the first to reach the shores of Belegaer; they sailed to\nAman on the first voyage of Tol Eressëa and remained there permanently.\n\n\n\nThe Vanyar are the fairest of all the elves hence their name: the FAIR\nELVES. Unlike the others who were attracted to the sea or the building\nand forging of things, the Vanyar culture seemed to revolve about Valar\nand Valinor. This is probably the reason why they choose to stay in\nValinor proper centered around Taniquetil, the seat of the rulers of\nArda, and loved the light of Valinor best of all the other places in\nAman and the wisdom of the Valar, and why they were favored by Manwë and\nVarda and always distrusted Melkor. They are known to have had the\ngreatest skill in poetry of all the Elves, likened to Manwë who loves\nthem for it. Their hair colour was golden and their banners white.\n\nIngwë was their king.\n\n\nHistory\n\nVanyar are descendants of Imin, the first Elf to awake at Cuiviénen, his\nwife Iminyë, and six other pairs of Elves who were awoken by them.\nImin's companions, Tata and Enel, later awoke groups of nine and twelve\npairs respectively, and Imin decided that since his group was now the\nsmallest and each group that he and his companions discovered was larger\nthan the last, he would now choose third rather than first in order to\nmake up the numbers. However, only a further two groups were discovered,\nleaving Imin's group of fourteen by far the smallest of the three Elven\nclans.\n\nWhen the Elves were discovered by Oromë, each clan chose an ambassador\nto return with him to Valinor to verify his claims of its greatness. The\nMinyar (Imin's companions) sent Ingwë. Upon his return, his people were\nswayed by his testimony and adopted him as their king (appropriate, as\nthe name Ingwë means chieftain in Quenya), and he led them with Oromë to\nAman. Ingwë has since been reckoned the High King of all Elves, and\nbecame known as Ingwë Ingweron, the “Chief of Chieftains”, and his\npeople were known by the rest of the Eldar as the Vanyar. In Aman the\nVanyar first dwelt in Tirion. Later, they came to love the full light of\nthe Trees and wandered into Valinor or settled on Taniquetil. He dwells\nwith them on the slopes of Taniquetil, beneath the halls of Manwë.\n\nAfter arriving in Aman, the Vanyar were rarely seen even by other Elves.\nVery few individual Vanyar are named besides Imin, Ingwë, his sister (or\npossibly niece) Indis, and Amarië, who was in love with Finrod Felagund.\n\n☀, Indis, the second wife of Finwë, the High King of the Ñoldor and the\nmother of both Fingolfin and Finarfin, the latter of which founded the\nonly house of Noldorin Elves to sport golden Vanyarin hair. After her\nhusband was killed by Melkor in his attack on Formenos to attain the\nSilmarils , she returned to her people with her daughter Findis.\n\nUnlike the Noldor, the Vanyar loved the light of Valinor so much that\nthey never choose to return to Middle-earth save when many of the Vanyar\nmarched in the War of Wrath with the Host of Valinor. Though they\npreferred the peaceful light of Valinor, the Vanyar were skilled in the\narts of war and were known for their fashioning of spears, thus they\nno doubt fielded a formidable army in the war. Ingwë's son led an armed\nhost of his people from Valinor to fight in the War of Wrath. They\nreturned to Aman, along with most of the Eldar living in the now largely\ndestroyed Beleriand, at the end of the First Age.\n\n\nRelations\n\nGaladriel was the granddaughter of Indis. It is to her Vanyarin blood\nthat Galadriel owes her famous silver-gold hair.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Vanyar_ means 'Fair-ones' in Quenya , referring to their\ngolden hair. The Vanyar often called themselves MINYAR; IPA: ; “Firsts”;\nsingular MINYA; adjectival MINYARIN; ), their ancient name. This ancient\nname does not still refer to any of the Avari who remained in\nMiddle-earth, since all of the Vanyar heeded the call of the Valar to\ncome to Valinor.\n\n\nOther Versions of the Legendarium\n\nIn the earliest versions of Tolkien's mythology (see: _The History of\nMiddle-earth_), they were called INGWI, as they were the people of\nIngwë, the High King of the Elves.\n\n\nGallery\n\nImage:Indis the Fair by vigshane.jpg|Indis the Fair, the wife of Finwë,\nthe first High King of the Ñoldor and Queen of the Ñoldor, by Filat\nImage:Amarie of the vanyar by Filat.jpg|Amarie, the love of Finrod, by\nFilat"

    "text": "HUAN was a great wolfhound of the First Age. He was given by the Vala\nOromë the Hunter to his friend Celegorm, one of the Sons of Fëanor. Huan\nwas as large as a small horse, and accompanied Celegorm on his huntings.\nWhen the Ñoldor under Fëanor rebelled, Huan went with his master to\nMiddle-earth.\n\nHuan had been granted special powers by the Valar, and was allowed to\nspeak three times before he died. It was also prophesied that he could\nnot be killed unless it was by the greatest wolf that ever lived.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nHuan was originally a Hound of Oromë in Valinor and was eventually given\nto Celegorm, Fëanor's third son. He went into exile with his master\nduring the Flight of the Ñoldor. He might have stayed with his master in\nHimlad and later fled with him to Nargothrond after their defeat in the\nDagor Bragollach.\n\nHe became involved with the Quest for the Silmaril. When Beren had left\nLúthien and gone with Finrod Felagund to Angband but had been captured\nin Tol-in-Gaurhoth, Lúthien set out to rescue him. She was intercepted\nby Celegorm and Curufin, who were living in Nargothrond at the time and\nwere hunting. Huan smelt Lúthien and captured her, and she was brought\nbefore Celegorm. Celegorm and Curufin did not reveal to her that they\nhad sent Beren to his death by the hand of Sauron, and took her as a\nprisoner to Nargothrond, “for her own protection”, secretly plotting to\nwed her to Celegorm and thereby force an alliance with Lúthien's father\nThingol.\n\n\n\nHuan felt pity for Lúthien, and sought her out. Speaking for the first\ntime, he told her of a way to escape, using a secret exit, and then\naccompanied her to Tol-in-Gaurhoth where, with the help of Lúthien's\nmagic, he killed all of Sauron's werewolves until Sauron himself came\nout, knowing of the prophesy about Huan's death he took the shape of the\ngreatest wolf that had ever lived up to that point. Huan nevertheless\nmanaged to defeat him, and Sauron was forced to flee. Huan went back to\nhis master, while Lúthien and Beren went on their way back to Doriath,\nthey came across Celegorm and Curufin once more, who had been exiled\nfrom Nargothrond by Orodreth when he learned of their deeds. Curufin\ntried to kill Lúthien, but Huan turned against his master, defending\nBeren and Lúthien.\n\n\n\nSpeaking for the second time, Huan told Beren and Lúthien of his plan to\ngain entrance to Angband, bringing them the skin of the werewolf\nDraugluin and the bat-skin of Sauron's messenger Thuringwethil. Using\nthese skins as disguise Beren and Lúthien went to Angband, while Huan\nhunted in the wild.\n\nAfter Beren and Lúthien had won the Silmaril but Beren had lost his hand\nto the werewolf Carcharoth, Huan joined Beren, Thingol, Beleg Cúthalion\nand Mablung in the Hunt for the Wolf. Huan and Beren managed to kill\nCarcharoth, but Huan was mortally wounded. Speaking for the third and\nlast time, he wished Beren and Lúthien farewell, and died.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_HUAN_ literally means “great dog, hound”, deriving from the\nSindarin _hû_ (“hound”).\n\nIn Quenya, Huan also means “hound”, which comes from the word _khugan_\nor _hunen_.\n\n\nOther versions in the legendarium\n\nIn earlier texts, Huan was described to be the “Captain of Dogs” and a\nrival to Tevildo (later Sauron), the Prince of Cats. Here, Huan met\nTinuviel (Lúthien), who was initially afraid and fled from him. With his\nspeed Huan overtook her in two leaps and spoke “soft and deep the tongue\nof the Lost Elves”.\n\nThere was also a mention of Huan being a possible Maia, along with\nSorontar (Thorondor).\n\nSome of this storyline is re-adapted back into Beren and Lúthien (2017)\nfor the 'complete tale'.\n",

    "text": "MELIAN (Sindarin IPA: ) was a Maia of the race of the Ainur, Queen of\nDoriath and mother of Lúthien Tinúviel.\n\n\nBiography\n\nBefore she came to Middle-earth, Melian served both Vána and Estë, and\ndwelt in Lórien tending the trees that grew in the Gardens of Irmo.\nAmong all of her people none were wiser, (With the possible exception of\nGandalf) more beautiful, or more skilled in singing enchanting songs\nthan Melian. She loved the deep shadows of the great trees. When the\nlight of the Two Trees would mingle Melian would sing and the Valar\nwould stop their work and listen. Nightingales went with her wherever\nshe went, and she taught them their song. Of all the Valar she was most\nakin to Yavanna. When the Elves awoke on the shore of Cuiviénen she\ndeparted from Valinor and went to Middle-earth, where she filled its\nsilence with her singing and the singing of her birds.\n\n\n\nWhile in the forest of Nan Elmoth she met and fell in love with the\nElven-king Elu Thingol, and later she ruled the kingdom of Doriath by\nhis side. For thousands of years, she used her powers to guard and\ndefend the city with a protection spell called the _Girdle of Melian_,\nbut she predicted that one person would one day breach this defense. The\nGirdle functioned to bewilder any who attempted to enter Doriath, and\nwas so potent that even Ungoliant was unable to bypass it. She and her\nhusband had a child, a daughter named Lúthien. During her stay in\nDoriath she became a friend and mentor of Galadriel. Melian wanted to\nknow the cause of the exile of the Ñoldor. Galadriel only briefly\nnarrated the story to her, leaving out the death of Finwë, the\nKinslaying at Alqualondë, and the burning of the ships at Losgar. But\neventually she and Thingol learned the truth.\n\nMelian's main line of descent is of the Half-elven, and through her\ndaughter the Maian blood passed to both Elves and Men. When Beren\narrived as foretold, she counseled Thingol against sending Beren for a\nSilmaril, a quest which would eventually lead to Doriath's ruin. A\nfriend of Mankind, she also aided Húrin's family by hosting Túrin in\nDoriath and later helped Beleg Cúthalion in his search for Túrin by\ngiving him Lembas. When Húrin came to Doriath old and carrying a great\ngrief and misery on him, Melian helped him see through his ills. After\nThingol's death she left Doriath, visiting Beren and Lúthien for a time\nwarning them of the Dwarves treachery, and the curse on the Mîm's\ntreasure. Shortly there-after, she went back to Valinor, musing upon her\nsorrows in the gardens of Lorien whence she came.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Melian_ is Sindarin, from the Quenya _Melyanna_, of which the roots are\n_mel_ (love) and _anna_ (gift). The name means “dear gift.” Earlier\nversions of Melian's name were '''Gwenniel '''and GWENETHLIN. _Beren\nand Lúthien_ (2017) reintroduces the names GWENDELING and GWENDELIN into\nthe 'complete story'.\n\nHer rare title-name _Tóril_ is a word for “Queen.”\n",

Elves were the first of the Children of Ilúvatar\nto appear in Middle-earth, whereas Men were not to follow until the\nbeginning of the First Age, with the creation of the Sun and Moon, many\nthousands of years later.\n\nElves were also named the _Quendi_ (“those who speak”, in Quenya) and\nthe _Minnónar_ (“Firstborn”). They were further divided into many\ngroupings, often distinguished by their respective linguistic branches.\nMen were also named the _Apanónar_ (“Those born after” or “Afterborn”),\n_Fírimar_ (“Mortals”), _Engwar_ (“the Sickly”), and the _Followers_.\nThese somewhat derogatory names were given to Men by the Elves, who were\nthe primary historians of the early events of Middle-earth.The reason\nfor this naming was simple.\n\nDwarves were not originally included in this distinction, as they were\ncreations of Aulë alone.

    "text": "QUENTA SILMARILLION is a collection of fictional legends written by J.\nR. R. Tolkien. It was published after his death as part of _The\nSilmarillion_ together with four shorter stories. As Tolkien did not\nfinish it, the collection was completed by his son Christopher with\nassistance of the young Guy Gavriel Kay. The title _Quenta Silmarillion_\nis translated as “the Tale of the Silmarils”. The QUENTA SILMARILLION is\nthe third part of the _The Silmarillion._\n\n_Quenta Silmarillion_ is the largest final-rendition account of the\nFirst Age, and its stories narrate all of that Age's major events.\n\n\nContents\n\n-   Of the Beginning of Days\n-   Of Aulë and Yavanna\n-   Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\n-   Of Thingol and Melian\n-   Of Eldamar and the Princes of the Eldalië\n-   Of Fëanor and the Unchaining of Melkor\n-   Of the Silmarils and the Unrest of the Noldor\n-   Of the Darkening of Valinor\n-   Of the Flight of the Noldor\n-   Of the Sindar\n-   Of the Sun and Moon and the Hiding of Valinor\n-   Of Men\n-   Of the Return of the Noldor\n-   Of Beleriand and its Realms\n-   Of the Noldor in Beleriand\n-   Of Maeglin\n-   Of the Coming of Men into the West\n-   Of the Ruin of Beleriand and the Fall of Fingolfin\n-   Of Beren and Lúthien\n-   Of the Fifth Battle: Nirnaeth Arnoediad\n-   Of Túrin Turambar\n-   Of the Ruin of Doriath\n-   Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin\n-   Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nTolkien envisaged _The Silmarillion_ as deriving from a manuscript\nwritten by an Eriol or Ælfwine of England; an imaginary Dark Age source\nfor the material, which itself contains little or no reference to the\npeople or events of the Second or Third Ages of his legendarium.\nOriginated from Elvish legends, in some parts it presents Elves as long\ngone, which hints that its final form was edited during the Fourth Age\nby Hobbits and/or Men.\n\nIt tells about the history of Arda (the Earth), after its creation by\nEru Ilúvatar. The Valar, angelic beings, enter into the world and try to\nshape it after a vision given to them by Eru. The initial shape of Arda,\nchosen by the Valar, was of a symmetrical continent lit by the Two\nLamps. However, the lamps were destroyed by the vicious Melkor; Arda was\ndarkened, and the lamps' fall spoiled the symmetry of Arda's surface.\nTwo main continents were created that are of concern to the story: Aman\nin the west, and Middle-earth in the east.\n\nFollowing this, Melkor hid himself from the Valar in his fortress Utumno\nin the north of Middle-earth. He also surrounded himself with horrible\nbeasts, many of them Maia in the form of fell animals, known as Balrogs.\n\nThe Valar moved to the western continent Aman where they established the\nrealm Valinor of which Manwë was made king. The Vala Yavanna created the\nTwo Trees which illuminated Valinor. Middle-earth, by contrast, was in\nperpetual darkness, and was seldom visited by the Valar. Only some of\nthem, most notably Oromë, visited it periodically, especially to prepare\nfor the coming of the Elves, which the Valar had foreseen in their\nvision and to keep an eye on Melkor's activities.\n\nIntroduction of the Elves\n\nOn one of his expeditions Oromë discovered the newly-awakened Elves at\nCuiviénen. The Valar, aware of the risk Melkor posed to the Elves,\nbeleaguered his fortress and finally overthrew him and took him prisoner\nto Valinor to serve “three ages” in the Halls of Mandos.\n\nOromë was then sent to the Elves again, to invite them to come with him\nto Aman and live there. Some of the Elves did not follow him or became\nsidetracked and stayed in Middle-earth, and so the Elves became\nsundered. These notably included the Sindar, who stayed in Middle-earth\nwhen their king, Thingol, became lost in the forest. He was to later\nemerge, married to the Maia Melian, and found the Kingdom of Doriath.\n\nThe Elves who accepted the summons were carried across the sea on a\nfloating island.\n\nThe Noldor and Melkor\n\nFinwë, the first High King of the Ñoldor, had a son Fëanor. At his birth\nFëanor drew so much life from his mother Míriel that she grew weary of\nlife and her spirit left her bodily form, departing to the halls of\nMandos. Eventually, Finwë married Indis and had two further sons,\nFingolfin and Finarfin. Fëanor became the most famous Elven craftsman,\nespecially by making the Silmarils, three jewels in which he trapped the\nlight of the Two Trees. The Silmarils were hallowed by Varda, and would\nburn any evil or mortal creature who touched them.\n\nAbout this time, Melkor, having completed his sentence, convinced the\nother Valar that he had reformed and he was released. By various lies he\nmanaged to play Fëanor and Fingolfin against each other, creating strife\nand division amongst the Noldor; furthermore, he convinced the Ñoldor\nthat they had been brought to Aman primarily so the Valar could keep\nthem under control. Finally, Fëanor rebelled against the Valar, publicly\nadvocating leaving and then drawing his weapon against Fingolfin.\n\nThe Valar were soon aware of Melkor's ultimate responsibility in this.\nTulkas hunted him, but Melkor had hidden and could not be found. Because\nhe threatened Fingolfin's life, Fëanor was exiled from Tirion for twelve\nyears. With his seven sons and his father Finwë he moved to a\nnewly-built stronghold, Formenos.\n\nCoveting the Silmarils, Melkor went to Formenos, hoping to trick Fëanor\nand gain possession of them, but Fëanor saw through his ruse and\ndismissed him with contempt. Melkor then traveled to Avathar in secret,\nwhere he joined forces with the evil spirit Ungoliant, whose form was a\ngiant spider-like creature. Melkor swore an oath to give Ungoliant\nwhatever she desired, and imparted some of his power to her. With her\nhelp, they traveled into Valinor secretly, where Ungoliant's poison\nkilled the Two Trees. Covered by an impenetrable blackness, Melkor and\nUngoliant then traveled to Formenos, assassinated Finwë and stole the\nSilmarils, before escaping in the confusion.\n\nMelkor and Ungoliant then made their way across to Middle-earth, and he\ngave Ungoliant all the great jewels he had stolen, except the Silmarils,\nwhich he desired to keep. The rapacious Ungoliant consumed them all and,\nstill hungry, she demanded the Silmarils, but the ever-treacherous\nMelkor reneged on his oath, so she seized him and bound him with her\nwebs, and his anguished cries echoed across all of Middle-earth.\n\nMelkor escaped from Ungoliant with the help of his former servants, the\nBalrogs, who came to his aid from their hiding places in the deepest\nrecesses of the ruins of Utumno, and he re-established his empire in the\nNorth from his secondary fortress of Angband. He placed the three\nSilmarils, which now were the only source of the unmarred light of the\nTwo Trees, in his Iron Crown, although his hands were burned black by\nthem.\n\nFëanor was furious at the death of his father and the theft of the\nSilmarils. Travelling to Tirion in violation of his exile, he publicly\nblamed both Melkor, whom he named Morgoth, and the Valar (for failing to\nprotect Finwë and the Silmarils). He urged the Noldor to leave Valinor,\nfor a punitive expedition against Morgoth and a new life in\nMiddle-earth. He and his sons then swore the notorious Oath of Fëanor,\nvowing to pursue with hatred anyone who withheld a Silmaril from them.\n\nDeparture of the Noldor and assault on Doriath\n\nInflamed by the passionate urging of Fëanor, most of the assembled\nÑoldor left Tirion, and traveled to Alqualondë, attempting to persuade\nthe Teleri to join them, or at least to lend them ships to cross the\nGreat Sea. When the Teleri refused, Fëanor ordered that the swan-ships\nbe taken by force; the notorious Kinslaying ensued, in which many Teleri\nwere slaughtered. Shortly afterwards, at the northern boundary of\nEldamar, the Noldor encountered Mandos, who cursed all the Ñoldor who\nleft with Fëanor .\n\nAt this point, Finarfin, who had always been reluctant to leave, turned\nback to Valinor with a small number of followers. Many ships had been\nlost by this time and not all the Ñoldor could cross to Middle-earth, so\nFëanor and his sons seized the remaining swan-ships, abandoning\nFingolfin and his followers (including Galadriel), who were obliged to\nmake their way to Middle-earth across the terrible ice wastes of the\nHelcaraxë. Approximately 2.2 million Noldor are said to have perished on\nthe Helcaraxë.\n\nMeanwhile, Morgoth attempted to conquer Doriath, the realm of Thingol\nand Melian in Middle-earth. In the first of five great Battles, he sent\nout two armies of Orcs, forcing Thingol and his Maia queen to establish\na magical boundary around Doriath, the “Girdle of Melian”, while the\ncoastal Elves were forced to retreat into their fortified harbour towns.\nBy luck, Fëanor and his host arrived at the height of this conflict and\nthe combined forces of the Ñoldor and the Sindar utterly defeated the\nOrc armies in the second Battle, Dagor-nuin-Giliath (Battle under the\nStars). However Fëanor, in his fury, chased after the retreating Orcs\nand he was ambushed and killed by Balrogs.\n\nThe Sun and the Moon, the Long Peace and the Coming of Men\n\nThe grieving Valar could not revive the Two Trees,because Fëanor would\nnot give up the silmarills which captured the light of the trees. But\nthey were able to create the Moon and the Sun from a silver leaf and a\ngolden fruit, which were all that remained of them. These new lights\nilluminated Middle-earth, stimulated much new plant and animal growth,\nand for a while, confounded the plans of Morgoth. Unable to assail them,\nas his once near-limitless power grew ever more dispersed among his\nservants, who feared the new lights no less than he, the Dark Lord was\nforced to take refuge in clouds and shadow that surrounded his\nstrongholds. In this era, Men, the younger Children of Ilúvatar, awoke\nin eastern Middle-earth, and some began to migrate westward.\n\nThe Ñoldor established kingdoms and principalities in northern and\ncentral Beleriand, which were ruled by the descendants of Fëanor,\nFingolfin and Finarfin. They built many great strongholds, including the\nvast cavern-city of Nargothrond, on the river Narog, and the mighty\nhidden mountain fortress of Gondolin, ruled by Turgon, from whence none\nwho entered were permitted to leave. Many of the Sindar, the native\nElves of Beleriand, were absorbed into the Ñoldorin kingdoms. Others\nwere in Sindarin states: Thingol's kingdom in Doriath, the coastal Falas\nruled by Círdan the shipwright, and the secretive Green-Elves of\nOssiriand.\n\nRelations between the Ñoldor and the independent Sindar were at first\namicable but they later deteriorated. The Ñoldor had long hidden the\ntruth about the Kinslaying and the Curse from Thingol, but he eventually\nlearned of it from Angrod. As a result he banned all the Ñoldor (except\nhis kin in the house of Finarfin) from entering Doriath, decreeing also\nthat the Noldorin tongue could no longer be spoken within his realm.\n\nA further rift between the Ñoldor and the Sindar, which was to have\nfar-reaching consequences, was caused by the actions of Aredhel,\ndaughter of Fingolfin and sister of Turgon. Tiring of her long\nconfinement in Gondolin, she rode east to seek out her old friends, the\nsons of Fëanor, but she was barred from crossing through Doriath by the\ndecree of Thingol. Forced to skirt along the edge of the dreaded region\nof Nan Dungortheb (where Ungoliant had gone after the escape of\nMorgoth), Aredhel was separated from her escort and lost. She was\neventually found by Eöl, the Dark Elf, a kinsman of Thingol who lived\nalone in the dark forest of Nan Elmoth. He took her as his wife, and\nthey had a son, Maeglin. Eöl often traveled east to deal with the\nDwarves of the Blue Mountains, and he acquired great skill in metalwork\nfrom them, which he imparted to his son. He refused to let his wife and\nchild leave his domain, but Aredhel determined to return to Gondolin\nwith her son, so they waited until Eöl left for the east and then made\ntheir escape.\n\nEöl pursued them to Gondolin, where he was captured and brought before\nTurgon. Eöl demanded that Maeglin should leave with him, or be cursed,\nbut Maeglin renounced his father. Turgon then decreed that Eöl must\neither remain in Gondolin or die. The next day, when he was again\nbrought before Turgon, Eöl tried to kill Maeglin with a poisoned lance,\nbut Aredhel stepped between them; struck in the shoulder, she died that\nnight. As punishment, Turgon had Eöl thrown to his death from the walls\nof the fortress. Maeglin remained in Gondolin, became a mighty warrior\nand wrought many great weapons, but his forbidden love for his cousin\nIdril Celebrindal would eventually cause him to betray Gondolin to\nMorgoth.\n\nAfter fifty years, and believing the Noldor to be unprepared for war,\nMorgoth again attacked the from the north, but Fingolfin and Maedhros\nwere ready for him and they defeated Morgoth's forces in the third\nBattle, called Dagor Aglareb, pursuing the Orcs to the very gates of\nAngband and destroying them utterly. They then laid the Siege of\nAngband, which lasted for four hundred years.\n\nAlmost one hundred years after the Dagor Aglareb, Morgoth's forces tried\nto attack the realm of Hithlum by stealing in from the far north-west,\nbut were intercepted and defeated by Fingon. After a further hundred\nyears, Morgoth sent forth the dragon Glaurung, the first of the\nFire-drakes. Being only half-grown and not fully armoured, Glaurung was\nunable to withstand Fingon and his archers, eventually fleeing back to\nAngband. The period after the first defeat of Glaurung became known as\nThe Long Peace, lasting almost two hundred years.\n\nIt was during this time, about three hundred years after the Noldor had\narrived in Beleriand, that Men first came into Middle-earth from the\nregions far to the east. They first appeared in Ossiriand, where\nFelagund was the first of the Noldor to see them. Over the next hundred\nyears many of them became allies of the Noldor in the war against\nMorgoth, and settled in Noldorin realms.\n\nThe Dagor Bragollach\n\nMorgoth, however, merely used the Siege as an opportunity to build up\nstrength, and in , renewed the war on his own terms. The fourth Great\nBattle, Dagor Bragollach became famous for the re-emergence of the\nDragon Glaurung in his full strength. Morgoth's armies overthrew the\nSiege, slaying many of the Noldor, with Glaurung laying waste to\nArd-galen and Dorthonion.\n\nEnraged by the assaults against his people, Fingolfin fearlessly made\nhis way alone to the gates of Angband, where he challenged Morgoth to\nsingle combat and the evil Vala was forced to come out and meet him\nrather than appear cowardly. In the ensuing battle Fingolfin wounded\nMorgoth seven times, but eventually stumbled and fell among the great\npits created by Morgoth's hammer, Grond. Morgoth beat Fingolfin to the\nground three times with his great shield, and then crushed Fingolfin\nunder his foot, but with his dying strength Fingolfin slashed Morgoth's\nfoot, maiming him.\n\nMorgoth broke Fingolfin's body and was about to throw the remains to his\nwolves, but Thorondor, the gigantic king of the eagles, had been\nwatching the battle from afar and at that moment flew down to rescue the\nbody. The giant eagle gouged Morgoth's face with his talons, seized\nFingolfin's body and carried it back to Gondolin for burial. After that\ntime Morgoth's seven wounds never healed, he became lame in his left\nfoot, where Fingolfin had hewn it, and his face forever bore the scars\nof Thorondor's talons.\n\nSixteen years later, Maedhros led the northern Ñoldor and their allies\namong Men in a final desperate attempt to defeat Morgoth. In this\nclimactic battle — which is named Nirnaeth Arnoediad— the forces of the\nÑoldor attacked Angband and briefly broke through the gates, only to be\nbeaten back when Morgoth unleashed his full forces, now vastly\noutnumbering those of Elves and Men. Led by the terrible dragon\nGlaurung, Morgoth's forces crushed the armies of the Ñoldor, and many of\nthe elf lords were killed or captured, leaving Morgoth master of the\nentire North. Afterwards, he set about destroying the remaining\nElf-kingdoms one by one.\n\nThe Dagor Bragollach was the battle in which Gil-galad left Hithlum for\nthe Havens of the Falas.\n\nBeren and Lúthien\n\nThe later parts of the _Quenta Silmarillion_ include two stories dealing\nwith individuals and with the relations between Men and Elves.\n\nThe tragic yet heroic story of Beren and Lúthien (which has similarities\nto the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice) tells of the love between the Man\nBeren and Lúthien, daughter of Thingol and Melian and the most beautiful\nof all Elf Maidens. Thingol, disliking mortal Men and determined to\nprevent their marriage, declares that he will consent only if Beren\nbrings Thingol a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown. Thus, in sending Beren\non this perilous quest, Thingol unwittingly binds himself to the Doom of\nMandos, ensuring his eventual downfall.\n\nTravelling to the mountains of Thangorodrim in disguise, Beren and\nLúthien succeed in making their way into Angband and to the very foot of\nMorgoth's throne. There Lúthien reveals herself, but her beauty and\ncharm enable her to briefly overcome the evil lord and she casts a spell\nthat puts Morgoth and his minions to sleep. Beren then cuts one of the\nSilmarils from Morgoth's iron crown, but when he attempts to take a\nsecond Silmaril his knife snaps and a shard flies off; it cuts Morgoth's\nface, and he begins to stir.\n\nAs they leave, Morgoth and his creatures reawaken and Beren and Lúthien\nare confronted by Carcharoth, the giant Wolf that guards the gate of\nAngband. Beren attempts to hold off the terrible creature with the power\nof the Silmaril, but Carcharoth bites off his hand and swallows the holy\njewel. Driven mad by the pain it inflicts, the creature goes on a\nrampage through Doriath until it is eventually killed by the mighty\nElf-hound Huan. In this final battle Beren is fatally wounded by\nCarcharoth, so Lúthien travels in spirit to the Houses of the Dead, to\nplead with Mandos for Beren's release. She and Beren are sent back to\nMiddle-earth alive, but Lúthien becomes a mortal woman, so that in time\nthey will both die and leave the Universe together. As immortals whose\nsouls are bound to Arda for as long as it lasts, Thingol and Melian\nsuffer the grief of being deprived of their daughter for all time.\n\nTúrin Turambar\n\n_Main article: Túrin Turambar_\n\n_See also: The Children of Húrin_\n\nAlso included is the story of Túrin Turambar. His father Húrin is\ncaptured at the end of the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, and for his\ndefiance, Morgoth places a curse on his family. Túrin becomes a great\nhero, but due partly to his hot temper and partly to a string of bad\nluck (in fact, the working of Morgoth's demonic will), whatever he turns\nhis hand to seems to go wrong, and death and grief haunt those around\nhim. Making matters worse, both Túrin and his sister Niënor are\nenchanted by the mighty dragon Glaurung — who has sacked the great\nElf-city of Nargothrond and taken up residence there — and they fall in\nlove and live for time as man and wife. Eventually Túrin kills Glaurung,\nbut with his death the spell is lifted. Driven mad by the realisation of\ntheir sins, Túrin and Nienor both commit suicide.\n\nGondolin\n\nThe last Elf-Kingdom to fall was the hidden city of Gondolin. Tuor, a\nmortal man, was sent by Ulmo as a messenger to Gondolin, to warn King\nTurgon of the city's impending destruction. Remaining in Gondolin, Tuor\nmarried Turgon's daughter, Idril, and they had a son Eärendil. Gondolin\nwas eventually betrayed to Morgoth by Maeglin, and destroyed. Turgon\nfell during the battle and the High Kingship passed to Gil-galad, who\ndwelt at the Mouth of Sirion. Tuor, Idril and Eärendil escaped, together\nwith a number of refugees.\n\nGrowing up, Eärendil married Elwing, granddaughter of Beren and Lúthien\nand current keeper of the Silmaril they took from Morgoth. With the help\nof the Silmaril, Eärendil and Elwing sailed to Valinor to plead with the\nValar, asking them to pardon the Noldor and assist Elves and Men in\ntheir need. The Valar agreed to this request, and set Eärendil, with the\nSilmaril, to sail the skies as a star until the ending of the world.\n\nBattle between Morgoth and the Host of the Valar\n\nThe Host of the Valar, led by Eönwë, finally attacked Morgoth in\nAngband. In this battle, the Great Battle (also known as the War of\nWrath), Morgoth was utterly defeated; his armies were destroyed, with\nonly a few remnants scattered across the Earth. He was taken prisoner\nand his two remaining Silmarils were confiscated. Maedhros and Maglor,\nFëanor's two surviving sons, stole the Silmarils from Eönwë, but they\nfound the Silmarils would not tolerate their touch, instead tormenting\nthem with burning pain. Maedhros committed suicide by jumping with the\nSilmaril into a chasm in the earth, and Maglor threw his Silmaril away\ninto the sea.\n\nThe Valar pardoned the Ñoldor for their rebellion, and the Teleri\noffered forgiveness for the Kinslaying. Many of the Ñoldor and the\nSindar left Middle-earth and traveled into the West, to live in Valinor.\nMany more followed Gil-galad and stayed in Middle-earth. Morgoth was\ncast out of the World, imprisoned in the Void that lies behind the Walls\nof Night. The Silmarils were lost “unless the World be broken and\nre-made”, but each one found its home in one of the elements: sky,\nwater, and earth."

    "page_id": "2360",
    "text": "The AKALLABÊTH is the fourth part of _The Silmarillion_, and the primary\naccount of the downfall of Númenor_._ It is relatively short, consisting\nof about thirty pages.\n\nThe story is written in the voice of Pengolodh, and is one of the more\nsignificant stories associated with Ælfwine.\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nAkallabêth (_The Downfallen_ in Adûnaic; Quenya is ''Atalantë;\n''Mar-nu-Falmar as another Quenya name.) is the story of the destruction\nof the Kingdom of Númenor, as written by Elendil. At the end of the\nFirst Age (described in detail in the _Quenta Silmarillion_), those of\nMen who had been helping Elves in their fight against Melkor were given\na new small continent of their own, free from the evil and sadness of\nMiddle-earth. It was located in the middle of the Great Ocean, between\nthe western shores of Middle-earth, and the eastern shores of Aman,\nwhere the Valar dwelt.\n\nAs they entered Númenor, the race of Men was forbidden to set sail\ntowards Aman, they gladly agreed to this because they regarded mortality\nas a gift and did not envy the Valar and Elves who could not die. For\ntwo and a half thousand years Númenor grew in might; Númenórian ships\nsailed the seas and established remote colonies, some of them in\nMiddle-earth. During that time the Elves of Middle-earth were engaged in\na bitter fight with Morgoth's former servant Sauron, who had turned into\na Dark Lord himself. The Elves asked for the help of the Númenórians and\nthey agreed but as time went on, over the course of one and half\nthousand years, Men desired immortality and rebelled against the Valar\nand the Elves. Their second last king, Tar Palantir, tried to amend the\nevil but it was too late. During this time, Númenor grew even more\npowerful.\n\nThe last king, Ar-Pharazôn, wanted control of Middle-earth, and so he\nattacked Sauron. Sauron's armies became afraid of the might of Númenor,\nand so he was captured and brought imprisoned to the Númenórian king.\nHowever, Sauron exploited his power to corrupt the Númenorian king to\nhis will. Soon he became his adviser, and much of Númenor obeyed his\nwill and worshipped Morgoth. Sauron convinced Ar-Pharazôn to try to\nassail Aman for immortality, desiring to destroy Númenor with the wrath\nof the Valar. However as this was done, the Valar appealed to Eru\nIlúvatar. Eru destroyed the Númenórian host, by crushing it under\nstones; however, he also caused the whole of Númenor to sink under the\nGreat Ocean. Just a few men of Númenórian royal blood, descendants of a\nlong line called “The Faithful” because they were uncorrupted by Sauron,\nhad fled Númenor by ships earlier with some gifts that Men received from\nthe Valar and the Elves in times of peace. They were led by Elendil the\nTall, and his two sons: Isildur and Anárion.\n\nThey set sail to Middle-earth, where the followers of Elendil\nestablished two kingdoms, which were managed as Númenórian provinces:\nGondor in the south and Arnor in the North. Some of the King's Men,\nenemies of Elendil, established other realms in exile to the south; of\nthese Umbar was the chief. The culture of Númenor became the dominant\nculture of Middle-earth (thus, Westron, a descendant of the Adûnaic\nlanguage of Númenor became the lingua franca). The sadness and the shock\nfrom the loss of a whole continent lived ever after in the hearts of\nkings of Númenórian descent. Arda was made spherical, and Aman was put\nfurther beyond Middle-earth, out of the reach of mortal men. Sauron,\nalthough greatly diminished and bereft of shape, escaped Númenor and\nreturned to Middle-earth once more.\n\n\nTextual history\n\nThe story originated with _The Lost Road_, an abandoned time-travel\nnovel. It was later adapted into back-story for _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nAs the Quenya name makes obvious, this is a retelling of the story of\nthe lost city of Atlantis, in the Middle-earth cadre. “Atalantë” is\nQuenya for “Downfallen”.\n\n\nCanon\n\nChristopher Tolkien notes in _The Peoples of Middle-earth_ that in the\nfinal version of Akallabêth, written by his father, the work is written\nin the voice of Pengolodh, and that the story was originally addressed\nto Ælfwine by him.\n\n    The authentic text began: “Of Men, Ælfwine, it is said by the Eldar\n    that they came into the world in the time of the Shadow of Morgoth\n    ...”\n\nChristopher then admits that this removal made the whole source lose its\nanchorage in Eldarin lore, and he believed he used poor judgment and\nexcessive vigilance, which also led him to alterations of the end of the\nparagraph (perhaps editorial work that was not his to properly make, as\nhe went against his father's original intent). Christopher also points\nout that the last paragraph of Akallabêth, as published in _The\nSilmarillion_, still contains indirect references to Ælfwine, the\n'Straight Road' and other 'future mariners', which he never altered or\nremoved."

    "title": "Ungoliant",
    "page_id": "2378",
    "text": "UNGOLIANT (Sindarin IPA: - “Dark Spider”) was a primordial taking the\nshape of a gigantic spider. She was initially an ally of Melkor in Aman,\nand for a short time in Middle-earth as well. She is the mother of\nShelob, and therefore the oldest, and first spider of the south,\npossibly even the first spider of Arda.\n\n\nBiography\n\nOrigins\n\n\n\nThe true origin of Ungoliant is unknown, and was not even known by the\nValar. It is said by some that she came from the Darkness itself that\nlies about Arda and was once an ally of Melkor when he looked down upon\nthe world with envy. Later, she changed her allegiance from him to\nherself, desiring only to be a mistress of her own insatiable craving to\ndevour all light - to feed her everlasting emptiness.\n\nEarly years\n\nWhen Melkor was defeated and imprisoned by the Lords of the West after\nthe first Elves awoke in Cuiviénen, Ungoliant escaped the attacks of the\nValar and the hunters of Oromë and fled to the southern part of Aman.\nThere, in a ravine south of the mountain Hyarmentir, she established her\ndark abode and took the physical form of a monstrous spider, and sucked\nup all the light she could find. After every feeding, she spun forth\ndark nets of gloom that strangled any light from entering her lair of\ndarkness. Yet she hungered for more of it: for although she hated light,\nshe craved its sustenance as well.\n\nAlliance with Melkor\n\nEventually, Melkor sought out Ungoliant in order to exact his revenge\nagainst the Valar and the Elves. He came to her and told her of his\nplans. Though she was tempted greatly by Melkor's plan for her to drink\nthe light of the Two Trees of Valinor, she feared the power of the Valar\nand was hesitant to accompany him. To mollify her, Melkor offered to\nsate her hunger with whatever she wished if she would aid him in his\nvengeance. She agreed, and they came shortly thereafter to Ezellohar,\nwhere she drained the Trees of their sap, poisoned them, and drank the\nWells of Varda dry. The Unlight produced by Ungoliant stymied the\npursuit of Oromë and Tulkas, and Melkor escaped to Middle-earth with\nher. However, her consumption of power of the Trees and the Wells caused\nher to swell to a size and shape so vast and hideous that even Melkor\nbegan to grow afraid.  When they arrived in Lammoth in Middle-earth,\nMelkor, now known as Morgoth, hoped to escape to the ruins of Angband\nwhere the remnants of his forces awaited him. Suspecting that he\nintended to leave his promise to her unfulfilled, Ungoliant demanded the\ngems that Morgoth had stolen from Formenos before they could reach\nAngband. She devoured them, and grew to an even more monstrous size. She\nthen demanded that Morgoth surrender to her the Silmarils. However,\nMorgoth refused, and she attacked him. Weaving her dark webs, she\nattempted to enmesh him in her nets and take the Silmarils by force.\nMorgoth gave out a terrible cry of pain as she attacked, which was heard\nby the Balrogs hibernating under the ruins of Angband. They awoke and\nimmediately rushed to the aid of their Lord, tearing apart Ungoliant's\nwebbing with their fiery whips and forcing her to break off her attack.\nShe fled, and the Balrogs prepared to pursue and destroy her, but they\nwere checked by Morgoth, who ordered them to return with him to Angband.\nUngoliant's attack upon Morgoth left an echoing scream ever after on the\nland that gave the area the name Lammoth, and it is said to this day\nthat when one screams in that place, the voice of the Dark Lord echoes\nback from the surrounding hills.\n\nFinal Years and Legacy\n\nDriven off by the Balrogs, Ungoliant fled to Nan Dungortheb, where she\nbred with the Great Spiders that dwelt there, increasing the terror and\npower of her kind. The creatures that later infested the area were her\nsurviving offspring and descendants, including her infamous daughter,\nShelob, who dwelt from the Second and Third Ages onwards on the borders\nof Mordor, as her last surviving child. It is said that Ungoliant\nultimately perished at her own hands when, in her ever growing and\neternal hunger, she eventually devoured herself. Others say\nUngoliant, after retreating to an isolated island in the Belegaer, was\nslain by Eärendil, and with her darkness destroyed, light came to many\nregions from which it had long been hid. Towards the end of the First\nAge, she had captured the sun (Arien/Urwendi) with her gloom nets and\nEarendil encountered her on his journey across the seas on the Vingilot.\nEarendil ultimately freed Urwendi freeing the Magic Sun.Similarly,\nTolkien projected a tale wherein Ungoliant ensnared the Sun in her webs\nwhile it sailed under the earth: with the result that the Sun was no\nlonger enchanted, only the Moon: Urwendi imprisoned by Móru (upset out\nof the boat by Melko and only the Moon has been magic since). The Faring\nForth and the Battle of Erumáni would release her and rekindle the Magic\nSun.\n\nTolkien, J. R. R.; John D. Rateliff.

    "text": "OSSIRIAND (Sindarin IPA: ) was a region of the eastern Beleriand. It was\nalso known as the LAND OF SEVEN RIVERS.\n\n\nDescription\n\nOssiriand was the most eastern region of Beleriand during the First Age,\nlying between the Blue Mountains and the river Gelion. Along the\nnorthern shore of the Ascar ran the Dwarf-Road to Nogrod. The region was\nwarm and gentle, with coniferous woodlands.\n\nSeven rivers lay in the region of Ossiriand, and these are (from north\nto south):\n\n1.  River _Gelion_\n2.  River _Ascar_ or _Rathlóriel_\n3.  River _Thalos_\n4.  River _Legolin_\n5.  River _Brilthor_\n6.  River _Duilwen_\n7.  River _Adurant_\n\n\nHistory\n\nOssiriand was a green and forested land, and it was not populated by the\nSindar. In the early First Age before the rise of the Moon, a part of\nthe Telerin elven people called Nandor entered Ossiriand under their\nleader King Denethor, and were given permission by Thingol to settle the\nlands.\n\nAfter them the land was often renamed Lindon, for _The Singers_, after\nthe old clan-name of the Telerin which the Nandor still used in their\ntongue. They became known as the Laiquendi, or Green-Elves.\n\nThe Elves of Ossiriand participated in the first battle of the Wars of\nBeleriand. After their leader Denethor was killed in an orc-raid they\nchose no more leaders, and many of them moved to Doriath.\n\nAfter the Quest for the Silmaril, Beren and Lúthien lived their second\nlives in Dor Firn-i-Guinar on Tol Galen. In FA 470, their son Dior was\nborn here. After the death of Thingol, Beren laid an attack against\nthe Dwarves of Nogrod, leading an army of Nandorin Elves and Ents.\n\nOssiriand was the only part of Beleriand that survived the War of Wrath,\nbut Belegaer the Great Sea broke through the mountain chain at the\nformer riverbed of Ascar, creating the Gulf of Lhûn. In the Second\nAge and Third Age, the former lands of Ossiriand and Thargelion were\nknown as LINDON, where Gil-galad the High King ruled.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name OSSIRIAND means “Land of the Seven Rivers”, from the Quenya\n_otso_ (“seven”), Sindarin _sîr_ (“river”), and '' -ian(d)'',\nwhich is commonly used in the names of regions or countries.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nWhile conceiving a name, J.R.R. Tolkien had numerous choices for this\nland. He originally wrote Broseliand (which eventually led to\nBeleriand). The other names were Colodhinand, Ñoldorinan, Geleriand,\nBladorinand, Belaurien, Arsiriand, Lassiriand, Ossiriand.",

    "text": "The EASTEMNET was a part of Rohan, and an area of wide,\ngrassy plains found east of the river Entwash, between it and the Great\nRiver Anduin. \n\nThe region was bordered by the lands of Anórien in the southeast, the\nEmyn Muil in the east, the Brown Lands and the Field of Celebrant in the\nnorth and northeast, and Fangorn Forest in the northwest. The land\nconsisted of well known places like the Wold, which were both short and\ntall grasslands.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe region was the site of the death of Eorl the Young in a battle with\nthe Easterlings in the Wold. In the past many herdsman and horse-lords\nwandered freely throughout this land in temporary tent camps, but by the\ntime of the War of the Ring they were empty.\n\nThere were few fixed settlements here, but many of the herdsmen of the\nRohirrim lived a nomadic existence on the fields of the Eastemnet,\nliving out of temporary camps and driving their herds across the\ngrasslands.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Eastemnet_ comes from the language of Rohan: the word\n_Eastemnet_ in that tongue means 'east-plain'."

The mountains themselves were of little\nconsequence during Morgoth's rule of Angband, save to occasionally spew\nforth fire and magma when Morgoth was either exceptionally wrathful or\non the warpath.\n\nAfter the death of his father, Maedhros was taken prisoner and nailed to\na cliff of Thangorodrim as a method of torture. He was rescued by his\ncousin Fingon with the help of Thorondor, King of the Eagles. After\nhis family was cursed by Morgoth, Húrin was imprisoned in a chair on a\nhigh terrace to watch the curse unfold.\n\nFor a time immediately after the creation of Thangorodrim, the Great\nEagles made their eyries on the three mountains at the command of\nManwë in order to bring him news of Morgoth's doings. However, at some\ntime during the First Age the Eagles moved to the Crissaegrim near\nGondolin.\n\nAt the base of the south face of the middle peak was the Great Gate of\nAngband, a deep canyon leading into the mountain, lined with towers and\nforts. There were also a number of secret gates scattered around the\nsides of the mountain group, from which Morgoth's hosts could issue\nforth and surprise their foes.\n\nThangorodrim was destroyed during the War of Wrath at the end of the\nFirst Age when Ancalagon, freshly slain by Eärendil fell dead on the\npeaks and crushed them to rubble.\n\n\nSize and Height\n\nThe exact size and height of Thangorodrim are unclear, though they were\nsaid to have been the tallest mountains in Middle-earth. One drawing by\nTolkien illustrated in Karen Wynn Fonstad's _The Atlas of Middle-earth_,\nif drawn to scale, would have made each mountain 35,000 ft high and five\nmiles across, and the statement that it lay 150 leagues (450 Númenórean\nmiles) north of Menegroth puts it too far away for some of the action in\n_The Silmarillion_ to make sense; a distance of 150-200 miles would have\nbeen more consistent. It is possible that with the higher figure Tolkien\nwas not referring to 'as the eagle flies', but rather 'as the wolf\nruns': the plateau of Dorthonion forced a long detour, which added the\nextra 200, 250 miles to the distance.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_THANGORODRIM_ was a Sindarin word that tied together the roots\n'oppression', 'mountain', and 'group'; together meaning roughly\n'Oppressive peaks'."

He was also called TULUKASTĀZ or ASTALDO.\n\n\nBiography\n\nHaving heard of his fellow Valar's struggle against Melkor, Tulkas was\nthe last of the Valar to descend upon Arda, thus tipping the scales of\nbattle against Melkor. Melkor fled before him, and the Spring of Arda\nwas begun.\n\nAfter the Two Lamps were erected and the Valar had made their first\ndwelling at Almaren, Tulkas wedded Nessa in a great feast. Being weary\nand content he slept, and Melkor decided his hour to retaliate had\ncome.\n\nWhen the Children of Ilúvatar awoke, there was a council among the Valar\nregarding Melkor. Much to Tulkas's delight, it was decided that Melkor\nshould be removed. During the War for Sake of the Elves, he wrestled\nwith Melkor and bound him with Angainor, which was forged by Aulë.\n\nUpon Melkor's release from captivity, Tulkas remained vigilant and\ndistrustful of him.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nTulkas is described as delighting in wrestling and contests of strength.\nHe wields no weapon, and rides no steed. As he cares little about either\npast or future, he was not a good councillor, but nonetheless a very\nhardy friend. He is described as being slow to wrath, but also slow to\nforgive; for that reason, he was one of the Valar that opposed the\nrelease of Melkor.\n\nIn appearance, Tulkas was described to have ruddy flesh and golden hair\nand beard.\n\nHe also tended to be impatient; before the Awakening of the Elves he\nurged the other Valar to wage war against Melkor. After the Darkening of\nValinor he also hurried Fëanor to take a decision about surrendering the\nSilmarils.\n\nTulkas was known for laughing in sport and in battle. He was possibly\nthe only being on Arda with the courage to laugh in the face of Melkor,\nthe most powerful being in Valinor (at the time) - and did so once while\nengaged in battle with him. Despite not being one of the Aratar, Morgoth\nfeared Tulkas more than any of the other Valar.\n\nHe was also the strongest (physically) of all the Valar. Most likely, he\nwas physically stronger than Morgoth, as it was he who first chained him\nwith Angainor.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Quenya, the name _TULKAS_ means “Strong” and “Steadfast”, from the\nroot _tuluk_. His Valarin name is TULUKHASTĀZ, which means “the\ngolden-haired”, from the words _tulukha(n)_ (“yellow”) and _(a)sata-_\n(“hair of head”). His Ñoldorin name is TULCUS (“Strong”).\n\nASTALDO means “the Valiant”.\n\nOther names\n\nAn earlier name for Tulkas was TURENBO.\n\n\nEarlier versions of the legendarium\n\nIn earlier texts, Tulkas overthrows Melkor during the battle of the\nSilent Pools and bounds him for Lumbi. Here, the Hound of Mandos,\nGorgumoth, guards Melkor in his captivity.\n\nIn an earlier context, Tulkas had a son Telimektar, “whose tale is yet\nto tell”.\n\n\nGallery",

He also has responsibility for pronouncing the dooms\nand judgments of Eru Ilúvatar under Manwë. His real name is NÁMO\n(Quenya; IPA: “Ordainer” or “Judge”) but was later known by the Elves as\nMandos after his sacred Halls of Mandos, over which he presides and\nwhere ultimately the Elves go after they are slain.\n\nMandos was the sixth greatest of the Lords of the Valar, and fifth\ngreatest Aratar.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nMandos was the brother of Irmo (Lórien) and Nienna in the mind of Eru\nIlúvatar. He and his brother Lórien are the Fëanturi, the MASTERS OF\nSPIRITS. His wife was Vaire the Weaver.\n\nHe it was who pronounced Manwë's Doom concerning the espousals of the\nEldar on YT 1172, when Finwë asked counsel for a second marriage, after\nthe death of his wife's passing to the Halls of Mandos.\n\nWhen Melkor began marring Arda before the coming of the Elves, Tulkas\narrived and wanted to make war swiftly. At the bidding of Manwë, Mandos\npronounced the doom of the Firstborn. After the captivity of Melkor,\nMandos had once again pronounced the Doom. Melkor spent three Ages in\nthe duress of Mandos thereafter, guarded by his hound Gorgumoth in\nLumbi. Mandos judged Fëanor to leave Tirion for twelve years after\nFëanor's drawing of sword against Fingolfin. After the destruction of\nthe Two Trees, Yavanna asked for the light of the Silmarils, which\nFëanor denied and he shall be slain, the first in Aman; but Mandos had\nspoken and revealed that Finwë was the first, having been slain at the\nsteps of Formenos by Melkor. When the Ñoldor revolted against the Valar,\nMandos appeared before them and pronounced the Doom of the Ñoldor.\n\nOnly once has he been moved to pity, when Lúthien sang of the grief she\nand her lover Beren had experienced in Beleriand. Then, with the Elder\nKing's approval, he released them to Middle-earth to begin their second\nlife there as mortal beings with no certitude of life.  When Eärendil arrived in Aman to beg for\nassistance from the Valar, Mandos considered Eärendil and Elwing's fate\nas Half-elven and gave them and their descendants a choice: either to be\ncounted among Elves or Men.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nMandos, upon appearing before the Ñoldor, was referred to be a dark\nfigure with a loud voice, solemn and terrible.\n\nHe was described as being stern, dispassionate and never forgetting a\nthing. He was the Vala who cursed the Ñoldor leaving Aman, and\ncounselled against allowing them to return. But unlike Morgoth, his\nDooms are not cruel or vindictive by his own design. They are simply the\nwill of Eru, and he will not speak them unless he is commanded to do so\nby Manwë.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis common name _MANDOS_ means “Prison-fortress”. It stems from\n_Mandost_ (“castle of custody”) or _mbando_ (“custody”) and _osto_\n(“fortified building or place”).\n\nHis real name, NÁMO, means “Ordainer” or “Judge” in Quenya.\n\nOther Names\n\nThe Old English translation for Mandos is NEFREA “Corpse-ruler” from\n_neo_ (“corpse”) and _frea_ (“lord”). His title is NEOAERNA HLAFORD\n(“Master of the houses of the dead”). He was also called MORIMANDO,\nthe “Dark Mando”, as opposed to Manwë's _Kalamando_, the “Light\nMando”.\n\nIn Tolkien's earlier work, Mandos was named VEFANTUR.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nAs Vefantur, his wife was Fui Nienna and together they were called the\n“Gods of Death”.

She was known as _VÁNA THE EVER-YOUNG_. \n\n\nBiography\n\nVána was the younger sister of Yavanna (_Queen of the Earth_) and the\nwife of Oromë (_Huntsman of the Valar_). In Vána's dwellings she had\ngardens filled with golden flowers; and often, Vána came to the forests\nof Oromë. Like her sister, the province of Vána was growing things of\nthe world and she was a lover of nature. Vána had influence with the\nflora and fauna of Middle-earth, and she was associated especially with\nflowers thus Vána was also known as the “Queen of Flowers”.\n\nIt was said that when the Valar Tulkas & Nessa were wedded on the Isle\nof Almaren, the first dwelling of the Valar, Vána robed her\nsister-in-law _Nessa the Swift_ (sister of Oromë) with her flowers.\n\nIn the Days of the Two Trees of Valinor, Arien of the Maiar, before she\ncame to carry the vessel of the Sun, had served Vána by tending to the\ngolden flowers of Vána's gardens watering them with bright dews from the\ngreat golden Tree Laurelin. Melian also was another Maia who\ninitially served Vána before she departed for Middle-earth.\n\nAfter the Darkening of Valinor and the flight of the Noldor to\nMiddle-Earth, most of the Valar were glad to have their ancient peace\nback, wishing neither the rumors of Melkor and his violence nor the\nmurmur of the restless Noldor to come upon them again. Thus for such\nreasons, they clamored for the concealment of their land Aman. It was\nsaid that Vána was one among them.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nAccording to _The Silmarillion_, “All flowers spring as Vána passes and\nopens if she glances upon them; and all birds sing at her coming.”\nVána robed herself in flowers and it was said that her hair was golden\nin color. Vána had the beauty of both heaven and earth upon her face\nand in all her works. Like Nessa, Vána also sang and danced along\nwith her maidens.\n\n\nThe Maiar of Vána\n\n-   Arien, the Maia who guided the Sun, was one of her Maiar in Valinor.\n-   Melian, who later in Middle-earth became Queen of Doriath by\n    marrying the Elf-King Thingol.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _VÁNA_ may have been derived from the Quenya word _vanima_\n(“beautiful”), as she is often described as “fair”.

So\nthe Valar were gathered upon Almaren during the _Spring of Arda_; and it\nwas sung that on this great feast, Nessa wedded Tulkas there at that\ntime where Nessa's sister-in-law, _Vána the Ever-young_,'' ''wife of\nOromë, robed Nessa with her flowers.

The Sindar additionally\nreferred to him as _TAURON_, which means “Lord of the Forests” and “The\nForester.” It is possible that the name comes from the Sindarin\n_taur_ (“forest”) or the Quenyan _taure_ (“great wood”).\n\nOther names\n\nIn the Old English translation of Eriol, Oromë is called WADFREA (“The\nHuntinglord”), HUNTENA FREA (“Lord of Hunters”), and WEALDAFREA (“Lord\nof Forests”).

    "text": "ULMO (Quenya; IPA: - “Pourer” or “Rainer”) - also known as '''Ulubôz\n'''or '''Ullubôz - '''was an Ainu, one of the Aratar, and the\nVala responsible for the control over the oceans of Arda. A lover of\nwater, Ulmo was one of the Arda's chief architects and was always in a\nclose friendship with Manwë. He always distrusted Melkor, and the Dark\nLord feared the Sea almost as much as he feared Varda because the sea\ncannot be tamed. Ulmo had no dwelling in Valinor or any permanent\ndwelling on land, as he preferred the deeps of the seas and the rivers.\nHis palace, on the bottom of Vaiya, was called Ulmonan.\n\n\nBiography\n\nUlmo seldom came to the Councils of Máhanaxar, and only when in great\nneed. He preferred to stay in Arda, not by walking on the land, as his\nform would fill man or elf with great dread. All waters were under his\ngovernment: bays, rivers and even the waters under the earth. Where the\npower of Morgoth was strong, however, Ulmo's own power would be sapped\nfrom waters near to Morgoth's corruption. It is through the rivers that\nhe kept in touch with Arda, and thus knew more of the goings on with the\nChildren of Ilúvatar than even Manwë, for in that way he lived in the\nvery veins of the world.\n\nHis visible form caused fear in mortals and even the Elves, as he\ndressed like a giant wave in glittering green armour, blowing his great\nhorns, the Ulumúri.\n\nUlmo always loved the Eldar and the Edain, even when the Valar forsook\nMiddle-earth. He opposed Oromë's plan to bring the elves to Aman, but\nhelped those that were willing to reach it. He uprooted a large island\nwhich was later known as Tol Eressëa and used it to ferry them across\nthe Belegaer to the Blessed Realm. Afterwards, he anchored it in the Bay\nof Eldamar, which he did because he knew the minds of the Teleri.\n\nUlmo was the Vala most responsible for the fall of Morgoth, by urging\nTurgon to build Gondolin and Finrod to build Nargothrond (FA 50). He\nappeared before Tuor and urged him to go to Gondolin as a messenger to\nTurgon. When he got there, he eventually married Turgon's daughter Idril\nand fathered Eärendil. Ulmo saved Eärendil's wife Elwing from the sack\nof the Havens of Sirion, allowing her to take a Silmaril to her husband,\nwhich allowed him to gain admittance to Valinor and plead for aid. Ulmo\nalso defended them in the council from the potential wrath of Mandos.\n\n\nMaiar of Ulmo\n\n-   Ossë, the vassal of Ulmo who guarded the waters around Middle-earth.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Uinen, the wife of Ossë whose love for all sea creatures calmed the\n    violent tidal waves and storms.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Salmar, the music performer of Ulmo who created the Ulumuri.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Uin, the “primeval whale” served under Ulmo. It is unknown whether\n    this whale was actually an Ainur to have shape like other races of\n    possible Ainur such as the Great Eagles.\n\nThrough these Maiar, Ulmo learned much of the Elves.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Ulmo_ means 'pourer''' _or 'rainer_' ''in Quenya.\n",

She was the sister of Mandos and Irmo and had no\nspouse. Her part in the Music of the Ainur was one of deep sadness, from\nwhich grief entered the world at its beginning. She had dominion over\nthe Halls of Nienna, which were on the western edge of Valinor, looking\nover the sea.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nNienna was concerned with mourning, and she pitied the suffering of\nothers, especially the Marring of Arda by Melkor. Yet the lesson of\nNienna is not of endless grief, but rather of pity, hope, and the\nendurance of the spirit.\n\nNienna dwelt in far western Valinor near Mandos, and she seldom came to\nValimar. Her windows looked out beyond the Walls of the Night.\n\nDuring the creation of the Two Trees, she watered the mound with her\ntears.\n\nThe pity of Nienna is most clearly seen in her support for Melkor when\nhe sued for the pardon of the Valar. Though she spent her time in the\nworld mourning for the destruction he had wreaked in Arda, when he sued\nfor release after his three ages of Captivity, Nienna spoke on his\nbehalf.\n\nAfter the Flight of the Ñoldor, Nienna mourned for the destruction of\nthe Two Trees, and her tears brought healing, but could not heal the\nmortal wounds. Thus, the trees brought forth their last flower and\nfruit, and made into the Sun and Moon.\n\nAll that is known about her appearance is that she wore a grey hood.\nGiven that Gandalf was her greatest student, his being clothed in grey\nmay have been a mark of respect to his teacher.\n\n\nMaiar of Nienna\n\n-   Olórin (Gandalf), Nienna's greatest pupil among all the others who\n    dwell in the Halls of Awaiting.

In Gnomish she was FUIL, the Queen of\nthe Dark. She dwelt in halls that bore her name, and had a roof of bats'\nwings. As _Fui_, she was the spouse of Vefantur (Mandos in Tolkien's\nlater writings) and dwelt in his halls of Ve. She judged the humans\nwhile Vefantur judged the elves.

He was presumably the greatest of all\nthe Eagles in terms of size, with his wingspan measuring at 30 fathoms\n(180 feet).\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nThorondor was sent by Manwë, King of the Valar, to watch over the Ñoldor\nafter they arrived in Beleriand. The Eldar first encountered him when he\nhelped Fingon rescue Maedhros from imprisonment from Thangorodrim, upon\nwhich he had apparently made his home for a short time. After that,\nThorondor and the rest of the Eagles settled in the Crissaegrim. When\nGondolin was built, Thorondor became the ever vigilant guardian of the\ncity. He rescued Fingolfin's body from defilement after Morgoth killed\nhim, giving the Dark Lord a scar on his face. He, Landroval, and\nGwaihir rescued Beren and Lúthien when Angband was aroused.\n\nWhen Gondolin fell, Thorondor rescued the survivors. During the War\nof Wrath, Thorondor and Eärendil led the Eagles in battle with the\nDragons, and may have fought with Ancalagon the Black.\n\n\nFate\n\nIn Tolkien's writings, Thorondor is not mentioned after the War of\nWrath. It is believed he returned to Valinor, although his descendants\nremained behind.

    "page_id": "2433",
    "text": "The NÍRNAETH ARNOEDIAD (“BATTLE OF UNNUMBERED TEARS”) was the fifth\ngreat battle against Morgoth that took place in the First Age.\n\n\nHistory\n\nAlmost twenty years after the defeat of the Elves and their Edain allies\nin the Dagor Bragollach, the Noldor had lost control over the entire\nnorth of Beleriand, and were for the most part reduced to holding on\ndefensively in Hithlum, Himring and Nargothrond. Gondolin was still\nhidden and could not yet be assailed. However, the deeds of Beren and\nLúthien, defeating Sauron at Tol-in-Gaurhoth and retrieving a Silmaril\nfrom Angband, convinced Maedhros that Morgoth was not invincible. In the\nyear 468 of the Years of the Sun in the First Age, Maedhros began\nbuilding an alliance that he believed capable of taking the war to\nThangorodrim, known as the Union of Maedhros.\n\nUnder the command of Maedhros, all the Elves of Beleriand, as well as\nthe Edain, Dwarves, and the newly arrived Easterlings were invited to\ncombine in arms and fight against Morgoth. Unfortunately, the Oath of\nFëanor and the evil deeds done by the Sons of Fëanor to fulfill it\ncaused the Union to have less strength than it could have had. For\nOrodreth, the Lord of Nargothrond, remembering the deeds of Celegorm and\nCurufin that indirectly resulted in the death of Lord Finrod Felagund,\nsent no aid to the alliance. Against Orodreth's will however, a small\ncompany under the command of Gwindor went from Nargothrond. Their hope\nwas to avenge the capture of Gwindor's brother Gelmir during the Dagor\nBragollach. Worse yet, from Doriath there came only Mablung and Beleg,\nwho wished to take part in the great deeds they knew were to come. For\nThingol, King of Doriath, had in his possession the Silmaril recovered\nby Beren and Lúthien, and the Sons of Fëanor sent to him a haughty\ndemand for its surrender. Thingol however, was both insulted by the\ndemand and had begun to lust for the Silmaril. Thus, against the counsel\nof Melian, he refused to surrender it. As a result, Celegorm and Curufin\nvowed openly to destroy Doriath should they emerge victorious from the\nbattle against Morgoth. Therefore Thingol enhanced the guard at his\nborders and sent no troops to aid Maedhros.\n\nThe Union divided its strength into two separate forces to attack\nAngband. Under Maedhros in the east were gathered the remainder of the\nSons of Fëanor, the Elves and Men of Himring under Maedhros and Bór, the\nmen of Amon ereb under Caranthir and Ulfang, and the Dwarves of Nogrod\nand Belegost. Under Fingon in the west were gathered the Elves and Men\nof Hithlum, the Elves of the Falas, the Haladin of Brethil, the\ncompanies sent from Nargothrond and the two Elves of Doriath, Beleg and\nMablung. The plan was for Maedhros's host, the slightly greater of the\ntwo, to march openly across Anfauglith and draw out the main army of\nAngband, after which Fingon's host would attack from the Ered\nWethrin and crush the armies of Morgoth between the two forces. They\nwould then seal the doors of Angband and, hopefully, drive Morgoth\nunderground forever. The Union first cleared Beleriand and Dorthonion\nfrom the Orcs, and then gathered to assault Angband. However, these\nattacks alerted Morgoth to the existence of the Union, and he took\ncounsel against it.\n\nMorgoth learned of the battle plan of the Eldar from his spies, and\nsought to prevent Maedhros's forces from meeting with Fingon's. To that\nend, he sent a gigantic force of his own, one which included Glaurung\nand his numerous fire-breathing brood, to destroy Maedhros's host.\nFingon's troops eventually settled in the woods of Ered Wethrin to await\nthe coming of Maedhros's forces, not knowing that they had been\nattacked. Upon the arrival of Fingon's forces to Ered Wethrin, smoke and\nfire poured forth from Thangorodrim and the Iron Mountains. Fingon thus\nknew that Morgoth had become aware of his forces, and doubt began to\ngrow on him. Just at that moment however, Turgon arrived unexpectedly\nwith an army ten thousand strong from Gondolin, and hope was renewed in\nthe heart of the Elven host.\n\nAware of both the location of Fingon's troops and the strategy the elves\nhoped to employ, Morgoth sent a great force of Orcs from Angband to meet\nFingon's host. In actuality, this force was but a small portion of the\narmies Morgoth had prepared, and was ultimately little more than bait.\nFor Morgoth intended for this decoying force to draw out Fingon's army,\nand then to strengthen it when Fingon came from the hills to meet it.\nBut Fingon, wary of the guile of Morgoth, ignored the taunts of the Orcs\nand kept his forces hidden. Seeing this, the captain of the Orcish host\nsent out riders with tokens of parley. With them was Gelmir, Gwindor's\nbrother of Nargothrond, whom the Orcs had blinded. To provoke the Elvish\nhost, they dismembered Gelmir within sight of the Ered Wethrin and then\nkilled him, threatening to do the same with their other Elvish thralls.\nUnfortunately, Gwindor himself was in the forefront of the Elvish host,\nand he witnessed the cruel murder of his brother. Insane with grief and\nrage, he broke ranks and charged the heralds with the company from\nNargothrond and slew them, driving deep into the center of the Orcish\nhost. Seeing that his troops could not be restrained, Fingon sounded the\ncharge, and committed his entire force to the battle. Here, Morgoth's\ndesigns nearly went astray, for the onset of the Noldor charge was so\nswift and terrible that the Orcish host was destroyed before it could be\nstrengthened. At the forefront of the battle were Gwindor and his\ncompany, and their wrath was so great that they burst through Morgoth's\nouter gates and slew the guard in the very courts of Angband.\n\nIt was said that Morgoth trembled as Gwindor's company pounded upon his\ngates, but surrounded by a sea of enemies they became trapped in the\ncourt, and all were slain except Gwindor who was taken, for Fingon could\nnot come to their aid. Then, from many hidden doors in Thangorodrim,\nMorgoth let forth his main host. Fingon's army was driven back from the\nwalls of Angband with great loss. The Men of Brethil that comprised the\nrearguard were nearly all slain, along with Haldir, Lord of the Haladin.\nThe fourth day of the conflict was the official beginning of Nírnaeth\nArnoediad, and Fingon's forces continued to retreat with their\ncasualties mounting. At the start of the fifth day however, Fingon's\nforces were joined by Turgon, who had withheld most of his troops from\nthe foolhardy assault. The phalanx of Turgon broke through the lines of\nthe Enemy, and met with the guard of Fingon, along with Húrin son of\nGaldor. With Turgon's help, Fingon's forces managed to beat back the\nhost of Angband enough to begin an orderly retreat. \n\nHowever, the fortune of the Eldar then took another turn for the worse.\nFor while Fingon's armies had been fighting Morgoth's forces on the\nplains of Anfauglith, Maedhros had been defeated by the armies that\nMorgoth had sent against his host. To make matters worse, Maedhros had\nbeen betrayed by Ulfang, one of the sons of Uldor, who had summoned a\ngreat force of evil men from the surrounding hills to attack the elven\nhost. Reeling from the unexpected treachery and the continual assault of\nMorgoth's dragons, the eastern host would have been utterly destroyed if\nnot for the valor of the Dwarves of Belegost. For they were naturally\nable to withstand the dragons' fire better than Elves or Men, and\nmoreover they wore great iron masks that gave them additional\nprotection. These dwarves formed the rearguard of the eastern host, and\nallowed the remaining Elves and Men to escape the dragons. Azaghâl, King\nof the Dwarves of Belegost, gathered his forces and formed a ring around\nGlaurung to keep him at bay. Such was their strength and the keenness of\ntheir axes that even Glaurung's armored hide was not invulnerable to\ntheir blows. Enraged, Glaurung struck down Azaghâl and crawled over him,\nbut with his last strength Azaghâl ran a dagger through Glaurung's\nbelly, and the dragon fled in pain. With him fled all the beasts of\nMorgoth. In a solemn ceremony the Dwarves picked up their fallen leader,\nforgetting about the battle, and they marched his corpse home. Their\nwrath was so great that none troubled them. Their sacrifice allowed all\nseven of the Sons of Fëanor to escape, though their host was routed and\nscattered throughout Ossiriand.\n\n\n\nAfter defeating Maedhros, Morgoth's eastern host had made haste to to\njoin the battle against Fingon's forces, and arrived as the elven forces\nhad begun to withdraw. As they engaged the retreating Elves, Gothmog\nhimself arrived on the field with his Troll guard and engaged Fingon in\nsingle combat. The High Elven King managed to hold his own against the\nHigh Captain of Angband until another Balrog restrained Fingon from\nbehind. Gothmog then clove Fingon's head with his Black Axe, and the\nfield of battle was soon utterly lost. Seeing this, Húrin begged Turgon\nto return to Gondolin, and told the King that he and his men would cover\nthe Elven retreat. Huor, Húrin and the remaining Men of Dor-lómin then\nformed a living wall across the Fens of Serech, buying time for Turgon\nto escape with most of the surviving Elves of the north. The warriors of\nDor-lómin were all slain, and Huor fell with his eye pierced by a\npoisoned arrow. Finally Húrin was left to fight alone, wielding the\ngreat axe of an Orc captain two handed. He managed to slay seventy of\nhis foes, including a great number of Gothmog's troll guard, falling at\nlast after his axe withered away from the caustic troll blood upon it.\nGothmog then pulled Hurin out from under the mountain Orcs and Trolls\nthat he slew, bound him, and dragged him to Angband with mockery.\n\n\nAftermath\n\nAfter Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the ability of Elves and Men to make war\nagainst Morgoth was broken. Morgoth's victory was essentially complete,\nas he had destroyed all the people of Hithlum and had scattered the sons\nof Fëanor away from Himring. Morgoth's orcs razed all of Beleriand\nexcept for Doriath, which was still protected by the Girdle of Melian,\nand sacked the havens of the Falas. Nargothrond was also still free, but\nMorgoth gave little thought to either it or Doriath, knowing that the\ntwo remaining Elven kingdoms were no threat to him.\n\nMorgoth betrayed his servants the Easterlings and trapped them in\nHithlum under penalty of death, denying them the fertile lands of\nBeleriand. Still Morgoth knew fear, for Turgon, now High King of the\nÑoldor after the death of Fingon in the battle, had survived, and his\ncity of Gondolin was still unknown to Morgoth. Hoping to discover the\nwhereabouts of Turgon, Morgoth summoned Hurin to him, seeking from him\nthe location of Gondolin. But Hurin mocked Morgoth and refused to betray\nTurgon. Morgoth then laid a terrible curse upon him and his kin, and\nbound Hurin to a chair upon Thangoridrim to witness the curse\nunfold.\n\n\nAn alternate version\n\nA first and older version of the story was drawn by Christopher Tolkien\nprimarily from a text called the _Grey Annals_, although the Quenta\nSilmarillion was used as well. But in the writing of the long Narn i\nChîn Húrin, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote a new version of the battle which\npostdates both the GA and QS accounts. Christopher Tolkien did not\nincorporate the major changes of the new version into the Silmarillion\ntext, although he did take some phrasing and description from it.\n\nIn the earlier version of the battle, Morgoth sent no armies against the\nforces of Maedhros, and instead Uldor delayed Maedhros's host with a\ntreacherous warning of a false assault from Angband. Maedhors eventually\nrealized what he believed to be a mistake on Uldor's part, and his host\nat last arrived to aid Fingon in the fifth day as Turgon's forces did.\nMaedhros's forces assailed the armies of Angband in the rear, and\nMorgoth was forced to release his reserves, including his Balrogs,\nGlaurung and his brood, and Gothmog the Lord of Balrogs. It was said in\nthis version that the Elves might still have won, but Ulfang and his\nEasterlings betrayed Maedhros, and summoned a great strength of evil Men\nfrom the surrounding hills, routing the host of Maedhros.\n\nThe major difference was that Morgoth defeats the Elves much more\nhandily in the newer version than he did in the old one. The entire\nelement of the “Machinations of Uldor” delaying Maedhros's march is\nremoved, and Morgoth sends a second force to meet Maedhros and prevent\nhim from joining with the other elf lords. This version also lacks the\nnearly explicit statement that the Elves could have won had it not been\nfor the treachery of men.\n\nChristopher Tolkien did not venture a guess on why his father made these\nchanges, but it may be that he felt the Elves did much better against\nMorgoth than they reasonably should have (especially given the extreme\nlength and difficulty of the later War of Wrath). This is all\nspeculation, however. It was explicitly stated several times both by\nin-universe characters and Tolkien in the Silmarillion that the Elves\nhad absolutely no chance of defeating Morgoth unaided, so it is possible\nthat the changes were made to concur with this line of thinking.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_NÍRNAETH ARNOEDIAD_ was Sindarin for 'Tears Unnumbered'.",

Aulë at the prayer of Yavanna forged two mighty lamps,\nIlluin and Ormal. Varda filled the lamps with light and Manwë hallowed\nthem, and the Valar set them up on high pillars, Illuin in the furthest\nnorth upon the pillar of Helcar, Ormal in the deepest south upon the\npillar of Ringol. In the middle of Arda, where the light of the lamps\nmingled, amid the Great Lake lay the Isle of Almaren, where the Valar\ndwelt.\n\nDestruction\n\nThe pillars were cast down and their lamps broken by Melkor. Lands were\nbroken, seas arose in tumult, and destroying flame from the broken lamps\npoured out over the Earth, marring it, causing the Valar to flee\nMiddle-earth for the Land of Aman, where they established the domain of\nValinor. Where Illuin fell, the Sea of Helcar was formed, of which\nCuiviénen was a bay.\n\n\nOther Versions of the Legendarium\n\nIn Tolkien's older writings (not used in the published version of _The\nSilmarillion_), the Valar sought peace with Melkor, asking his\nassistance with fixing the lamps upon Arda. Melkor, still envious and\nhateful of the rest of the Valar, agreed to give them a strong, sturdy\nsubstance. He gave Aulë ice. Melkor permitted the Valar to do as they\nwished until the fateful day when the Lamps' light and heat finally\nmelted the ice. The pillars crashed upon Arda, flooding it with water\nand darkness."

Helcar was destroyed by\nMelkor in an attack while the Valar rested from their labors, and\ncollapsed with devastating consequences to the world. This ruined a\ngreat part of Middle-earth, and waters (probably from Belegaer and the\neastern ocean) flowed in. Later here was formed the inland Sea of\nHelcar. The heat of Illuin then melted Helcar, and the meltwater of this\ntower formed the Sea of Helcar.\n\n\nEarlier versions of the legendarium\n\nIn some traditions it was said that Helcar was one of the two pillars\nmade by Melko (Melkor), not the Valar, out of ice - a substance that was\nnot yet known to the Valar."

    "text": "SIRION was a river in Middle-earth during the First Age, the principal\nriver of Beleriand. During most of its course, it was the border between\nEast and West Beleriand.\n\n\nSource\n\nThe Sirion's source was at Eithel Sirion on the eastern side of the Ered\nWethrin, which lay in between Ard-galen (later Anfauglith) and Mithrim\nand Hithlum. It was guarded by the tower of Barad Eithel.\n\nSirion flowed southwards along the border of the Ered Wethrin, passing\nthrough the Fen of Serech before entering the narrow steep-sided valley\nbetween the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath named the PASS OF SIRION.\nSirion then continued south into Beleriand, with the Forest of Brethil\nto the west, and Dimbar and then Doriath to the east. After leaving\nDoriath at Aelin-uial (the Fens of Sirion), it plunged below ground in\nthe Falls of Sirion at Andram, where the ground fell steeply. Three\nleagues southwards, the Sirion exited the underground caves at the Gates\nof Sirion. It then flowed further south through NAN-TATHREN until it\nreached the Bay of Balar, part of Belegaer, at the Mouths of Sirion. It\ntotal length was about three hundred and ninety miles.\n\nIn order from north to south, the principal tributaries of the Sirion\nwere the Rivil, flowing from Dorthonion until it met Sirion in the Fen\nof Serech; the Mindeb, which had its source in Nan Dungortheb and the\nEred Gorgoroth, the Teiglin, the Esgalduin of Doriath; the Aros flowing\nsouth from Dorthonion (and also containing the waters of the Celon from\nHimring and Himlad) which met at Aelin-uial, and the Narog, which joined\nSirion in Nan-Tathren.\n\nThe main crossing points mentioned in the Silmarillion were Brithiach\nwhere the road from Himlad, which crossed the Esgalduin at Iant Iaur,\ncrossed Sirion, and the Ferries of Doriath. The most important island in\nSirion was Tol Sirion. The original Minas Tirith was built here by\nFinrod Felagund in the strategic location controlling the Pass of Sirion\nwhere it entered Beleriand between the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath.\nShortly after Dagor Bragollach, Sauron captured it and the island became\nknown as Tol-in-Gaurhoth.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBarad Eithel, at the source of the Sirion in the Ered Wethrin, was a\nchief fortress of Fingolfin and his son Fingon, probably guarding a pass\ninto their realm of Mithrim. Further south, in the Pass of Sirion, lay\nTol Sirion. After the Coming of Men, the Edain of the House of Haleth\nmade their home in the Forest of Brethil, and the Sindar ruled by\nThingol lay secure within the Girdle of Melian in their realm of\nDoriath. At the outflow of Sirion into Belegaer, after the destruction\nof Eglarest and Brithombar, the Havens of Sirion were built by Círdan\nand his people."

    "text": "CUIVIÉNEN (Quenya IPA: ) was the location where the Quendi or the Elves\nawoke.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nCuiviénen was said to have been on the shore of a large gulf in the\ninland Sea of Helcar in the far east of Middle-earth. It was an\neastern bay of the Inland Sea of Helcar, formed by the meltwaters of the\npillar of Illuin.\n\nAfter the First Age and the War of Wrath, the Sea of Helcar (and\nCuiviénen with it) was drained, leaving behind only the Sea of Núrnen\nand the Sea of Rhûn, prompting the Elvish adage “and to Cuiviénen there\nis no returning”; both a reference to physical geography and a metaphor\nfor the Sundering. While never confirmed, there is a small chance that\nit survives in a much truncated form.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn YT 1050, the Awakening of the Elves took place. The Elves dwelt\nhere for a long time in bliss under the starlight and were content.\nHere the elves were divided into their three basic groups: the Minyar\n(Vanyar), Tatyar (Ñoldor), and Nelyar (Teleri), here they learned and\ndeveloped the basic skills of survival, culture, and language.\n\nUnfortunately, Melkor discovered this land first before the other Valar.\nMany elves feared him and they were forced to hide, and those\nunfortunate enough to be left behind or overwhelmed by fear and\nunhappiness were taken or slain. Then, years later, Oromë discovered\nCuiviénen on his travels throughout Middle-earth. Oromé reported his\ndiscovery back to the Valar in Valinor and after some debate they\ndecided that the Elves would be safer living in The Undying Lands, in\nthe peace and protection of the Valar. Oromé returned to Cuiviénen and\nthere spoke with the Elves regarding their removal to Valinor. The first\nSundering of the Elves then took place when the Eldar, name that was\ngiven by Oromé to the Elves using their own tongue, departed from\nCuiviénen to Valinor. Some of these Elves refused to leave through fear\nof the unknown, turned back after reaching the huge range of The Misty\nMountains, or simply decided to stay in Arda through choice.\n\nIt is unknown how long the remaining Avari remained at Cuiviénen during\nthe First Age, but they were there when Men awoke at the first rising of\nthe Sun in the nearby land of Hildórien, and its elven residents\nbefriended early Men and apparently taught them the basic skills of\nsurvival.\n\nOther mentions\n\nIn his attempt to sway the Ñoldor to join him in pursuit of Melkor to\nMiddle-earth, Fëanor spoke of the “sweet waters” of Cuiviénen that they\nhad left in vain to travel to Aman.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nCUIVIÉNEN is a Quenya word that means “Water of Awakening” from\n_cuivié_ (“awakening”) and _nen_ (“water”).",

It was fought on the plain of Tumhalad between the\nriver Narog and its tributary, the river Ginglith in FA 495.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe battle was fought as result of a massive Orc buildup beneath the\nEred Wethrin and in the Pass of Sirion. Messengers from Círdan the\nShipwright brought these tidings, with a message from Círdan concerning\na warning given to Círdan by the Vala Ulmo. Ulmo had told Círdan that\nthe Elves of Nargothrond shouldn't fight abroad, and instead to stay in\ntheir fortress.\n\nTúrin Turambar, who had by this time become an influential commander of\nNargothrond's armed forces, urged its king, Orodreth to venture out and\nfight the forces of Morgoth in the open. The Elves of Nargothrond,\nhowever, weren't used to battle in the open field for they had always\nwaged a secret war, ambushing but never assaulting the forces of\nMorgoth. Also, the evil hosts were larger than anticipated and led by\nthe Dragon, Glaurung.\n\nUltimately, the forces of Nargothrond couldn't withstand the assault of\nthe enemy host and were driven towards the plain of Tumhalad, where most\nof them, including King Orodreth and his kinsman Gwindor, were slain.\nOnly Túrin withstood the fiery attack of Glaurung for he wore the\nDragon-helm of Dor-lómin. The defeat suffered by the Elves paved the\nroad for the Sack of Nargothrond by Glaurung, and the death and\nenslavement of many captives, including Finduilas."

The Ñoldor, led by Fëanor and his sons, tried to persuade\ntheir friends, the Teleri of Alqualondë, to give him their ships.\nHowever, the Teleri would not help in any way against the will of the\nValar, and in fact attempted to persuade their friends to reconsider and\nstay in Aman. Unwilling to take “no” for an answer, the Ñoldor started\ntaking the ships and sailing them away. This angered the Teleri, and\nthey threatened the Ñoldor with rocks and arrows, and they threw many of\nFëanor's followers out of the ships and into the harbor. They also began\nto attempt to block the harbour; however, it is only slightly possible\nthat the Teleri drew first blood.\n\n\nThe Battle\n\nThen the Ñoldor drew swords, and the Teleri their bows, and there was a\nbitter fight that seemed evenly matched, if not even in favor of the\nTeleri, until the second Host of the Ñoldor, led by Fingon, arrived\ntogether with some of Fingolfin's people. Misunderstanding the\nsituation, they assumed the Teleri had attacked the Ñoldor under orders\nof the Valar, and they joined the fight.\n\nConsequences\n\nIn the end many Teleri were slain and the ships taken and many of the\nstolen ships were wrecked in the waves. All that continued towards\nMiddle-earth were therefore cursed by Mandos. The act also had\nrepercussions in Middle-earth, when the Sindar, especially those of\nDoriath, found out about it, costing the Ñoldor the support of the\nSindar in their war against Morgoth; the Sindar King Thingol barred\nthose of the House of Fëanor, or any others that took place in the\nKinslaying, from entering his kingdom. He also forbade the use of Quenya\nin his domain."
