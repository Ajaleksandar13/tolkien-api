    "text": "ARAGORN II, the son of Arathorn II and Gilraen, also known as ELESSAR\nand STRIDER, was the 16TH CHIEFTAIN OF THE DÚNEDAIN OF THE NORTH; later\ncrowned KING ELESSAR TELCONTAR (March 1, 2931 - FO 120 or SR 1541), the\n26th King of Arnor and 35th King of Gondor - and first High King of\nGondor and Arnor since the short reign of Isildur. He was a great ranger\nand warrior, and as Isildur's heir he bore the shards of Narsil,\nreforged and renamed _Andúril_, in the War of the Ring.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly years\n\n\n\nAragorn was a descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur. His ancestor Arvedui was\nwedded to Fíriel, who was descended from Anárion, who bore their son\nAranarth, making Aragorn the last descendant of Anárion as well.\n\nWhen he was only two years old, his father Arathorn was killed while\npursuing orcs. Aragorn was afterwards fostered in Rivendell by Elrond.\nAt the request of his mother, his lineage was kept secret, as she feared\nhe would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity\nas the descendant of Elendil and Heir of Isildur became known. Aragorn\nwas renamed _ESTEL_ and was not told about his heritage until 2951.\n\n\n\nElrond revealed to “Estel” his true name and ancestry when he was\ntwenty, and gave to him the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil.\nElrond withheld the Sceptre of Annúminas from Aragorn until he “came of\nthe right” to possess the item. It was also around this time that\nAragorn met and fell in love with Arwen, Elrond's daughter, newly\nreturned from her mother's homeland of Lórien where she had visited her\ngrandmother Galadriel.\n\nAragorn thereafter assumed his proper role as the sixteenth Chieftain of\nthe Dúnedain and the Rangers of the North, and left the comforts of\nRivendell for the wild, where he lived with the remainder of his people,\nwhose kingdom had been destroyed through civil and regional wars\ncenturies before.\n\nAragorn met Gandalf the Grey in 2956 and they became close friends.\nHeeding Gandalf's advice, Aragorn and the Rangers began to guard a small\nland known as the Shire inhabited by the diminutive and agrarian\nHobbits, and he became known among the peoples just outside the Shire's\nborders as STRIDER.\n\nFrom TA 2957 to TA 2980, Aragorn undertook great journeys, serving in\nthe armies of King Thengel of Rohan, and Steward Ecthelion II of Gondor.\nMany of his tasks helped to raise morale in the West and counter the\ngrowing threat of Sauron and his allies, and he earned priceless\nexperience which he would later put to use in the War of the Ring.\nAragorn served his lords in disguise and his name in Gondor and Rohan\nduring that time was THORONGIL (“Eagle of the Star”). With a small\nGondor squadron of ships, he led an assault on the long-standing rebel\nprovince of Umbar in 2980, burning many of the Corsairs' ships and\npersonally slaying their lord during the battle on the Havens. After the\nvictory at Umbar, “Thorongil” left the field and, to the dismay of his\nmen, went east.\n\n\n\nLater in 2980, he visited Lórien, and there once again met Arwen. He\ngave her the heirloom of his House, the Ring of Barahir, and, on the\nhill of Cerin Amroth, Arwen pledged her hand to him in marriage,\nrenouncing her elvish lineage and accepting the Gift of Men: death.\n\nElrond withheld from Aragorn permission to marry his daughter until such\na time as his foster son should be king of _both_ Gondor and Arnor. As\nboth Elrond and Aragorn knew, to marry a mortal, Arwen would be required\nto choose mortality, and thus deprive the deathless Elrond of his\ndaughter while the world lasted. Elrond was also concerned for Arwen's\nown happiness, fearing that in the end she might find death (her own and\nthat of her beloved) too difficult to bear.\n\nBefore the events of _The Lord of the Rings_ properly take place,\nAragorn also traveled through the Dwarven mines of Moria, to Harad,\nwhere (in his own words) “the stars are strange.” Tolkien does not\nspecify when these travels occurred nor does he indicate what happens\nwhen Aragorn visits.\n\nIn 3009, Gandalf grew suspicious of the origin of the ring belonging to\nthe Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, which later turned out to be the One Ring, the\nsource of the Dark Lord Sauron's evil power. Aragorn went at his request\ninto Rhovanion in search of Gollum, who had once possessed the Ring. He\ncaught the creature in the Dead Marshes near Mordor, and brought him as\na captive to Thranduil's halls in Mirkwood, where Gandalf questioned\nhim.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nAragorn joined Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's adopted heir, and three of his\nfriends at the Inn of the Prancing Pony in Bree. Though originally\nthe hobbits were suspicious of Strider, they eventually trusted him and\nprepared to escape Bree and the Ringwraiths. These four had set out\nfrom the Shire to bring the One Ring to Rivendell. Aragorn was aged 87\nat that time, nearing the prime of life for one of royal Númenórean\ndescent. With Aragorn's help, the Hobbits escaped the pursuing\nNazgûl. The elf-lord Glorfindel later arrived and led them to\nRivendell.\n\nThere, Aragorn chose to join Frodo, thus forming the Fellowship of the\nRing that was formed to guard Frodo, tasked with destroying the Ring in\nthe fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. Besides Aragorn, Gandalf, and Frodo,\nthe company included  Frodo's cousins Pippin and Merry, his best friend Samwise Gamgee,\nLegolas the elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and Boromir of Gondor.\n\n All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost;\nThe old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by\nthe frost. From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the\nshadows shall spring; Renewed shall be Blade that was Broken, The\ncrownless again shall be king.\n\n    — Bilbo's poem about Aragorn\n\nBefore the group set out, the shards of Narsil were reforged, and the\nrestored blade was named Andúril.\n\nAragorn accompanied the group through an attempt to cross the pass of\nCaradhras and through the mines of Moria. He helped protect Frodo from\nan Orc captain and became group leader after Gandalf was presumed lost\nin battle with a Balrog. Aragorn led the company to Lórien, where\nLady Galadriel gave him the Elessar.\n\nAfter Lórien, Aragorn and the Fellowship sailed down the river Anduin to\nthe Falls of Rauros. Though his original plan was to set out for Gondor\nand aid its people in the War, he felt responsible for Frodo after the\nloss of Gandalf.\n\n\n\nAfter passing into the Argonath, the Fellowship camped in Amon Hen.\nFrodo saw that Boromir had been driven mad by the influence of the One\nRing trying to take it. Frodo put the ring on, rendering him invisible,\nand ran away from Boromir. Frodo climbed to the high seat on Amon Hen;\nfrom there he could see Sauron's eye looking for him. The Hobbit felt\nthe eye but it was distracted by Gandalf the White later found in\nFangorn Forest by (Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli looking for Merry and\nPippin.) Frodo would struggle against the power of Sauron, finally\ntaking the ring off. Then Frodo knew what had to be done: He was to go\nalone to Mordor to destroy the ring. On the way back to the river he\nmeets Sam, who goes with him.\n\n\n\nAt this same time, the others were attacked by Saruman's Uruk-hai and a\nbattle ensued. During the ensuing battle, Boromir was killed defending\nMerry and Pippin and giving up his desire for the ring in a last attempt\nto resist the ring. After discovering that Frodo had left, Aragorn and\nthe others decided that they would leave Frodo and Sam to continue their\nquest on their own. Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn put Boromir's body and\nwar gear in one of the elven boats as a funeral boat and tribute to\nBoromir for his bravery and courage. His body would be sent to the Falls\nof Rauros.\n\nWhile Frodo continued his quest with Samwise Gamgee, Aragorn, Legolas\nand Gimli went to Rohan to free Merry and Pippin, who had been captured\nby the Uruk-hai working for Saruman.\n\nThe Three Hunters\n\n\n\nIn the fields of Rohan, the Three Hunters Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli\nencountered Éomer, who had recently been pursuing rumours of an orc raid\nin the area. From Éomer, Aragorn learned that the Orcs who had kidnapped\nMerry and Pippin had been destroyed and that the Hobbits had not been\nfound. Dejected, he led Legolas and Gimli to the site of the battle.\nClues led Aragorn to believe that the Hobbits might still be alive, and\nhe led the Three Hunters into Fangorn Forest. They did not find the\nHobbits, but they did find Gandalf the White, sent back from Valinor to\ncontinue his struggle against Sauron. Gandalf told the Three Hunters\nthat the Hobbits were safe with the Ents of Fangorn.\n\n Where now are the Dunedain, Elessar, Elessar? Where do thy kinsfolk\nwander afar? Near is the hour when the lost should come forth, And the\nGrey Company ride from the North. But dark is the path appointed to\nthee: The Dead watch the road that leads to the Sea.\n\n    - Galadriel's message to Aragorn\n\nTogether, Gandalf and the Three Hunters travelled to Edoras, where\nGandalf freed Théoden from Saruman's enchantment and helped him organize\nthe Rohirrim against Saruman. He allied with Théoden and led the\nrefugees to Helm's Deep.\n\n\n\nAragorn, Legolas and Gimli then help the people of Rohan in the Battle\nof the Hornburg, in which they conclusively and victoriously defeated\nSaruman's army.Afterward Aragorn went with Gandalf to Isengard only\nto find Isengard in ruins by the work of the Ents. Aragorn, being\npresent with Gandalf, Theoden, Éomer, Legolas and Gimli, negotiate in a\nfinal parley with Saruman. Saruman at first tries to bend Theoden to his\nwill and at first Theoden is almost swayed but then he masters his will\nand refuses to join with Saruman. Saruman then sneers at Theoden and\nturns his attention to Gandalf and tries to sway him, only to be laughed\nat. Then Gandalf offers him a chance of repentance without limits.\nSaruman turns white in his face at this, sadly in the end however\nSaruman refuses to repent out of pride and to leave Orthanc. Gandalf\nbreaks Saruman's staff as he is no longer the head and is banished from\nthe Order of Wizards and The White Council. After Saruman crawls away,\nGrima Wormtongue then throws the Palantír of Orthanc at Gandalf as he\nand the others are leaving the Orthanc tower. But misses not being able\nto decide who he hated more Gandalf or Saruman. Thus ending the Battle\nof the Hornburg and the Battle of Isengard.\n\nReturn of the King\n\n\n\nIn order to defend the city, Aragorn travelled the Paths of the Dead,\nand summoned the Dead Men of Dunharrow who owed allegiance to the King\nof Gondor. It had been prophesied by Isildur and Malbeth the Seer that\nthe Dead would be summoned once more to pay their debt for betraying\nGondor a millennia before. With their aid the Corsairs of Umbar were\ndefeated.\n\nAragorn, a small force of Rangers, and a large contingent of men and\nsoldiers from the southern regions then sailed up the Anduin to Minas\nTirith. When they arrived at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Aragorn\nunfurled a standard that Arwen had made for him which showed both the\nWhite Tree of Gondor along with the jeweled crown and seven stars of the\nHouse of Elendil. With the help of the southern forces the armies of\nGondor and Rohan rallied together and defeated Sauron's army.\n\nThe Steward Denethor II declared that he would not bow to a descendant\nof Isildur (years before, he had seen “Thorongil” as a rival to his\nfather's favor). Aragorn healed Faramir, Denethor's last heir, winning\nhim the immediate recognition of Faramir as rightful heir to the throne;\nhis humility and self-sacrifice gained him the hearts of the inhabitants\nof Gondor's capital city. Aragorn's healing abilities, moreover, were a\nsign to the people of Gondor of the identity of their true king; as\nIoreth said, _“The hands of the King are the hands of a healer, and so\nshall the rightful king be known.”_ The people hailed him as King that\nsame evening.\n\nDespite his immediate success and popularity, however, and despite his\nclaim to the throne through raising the royal banner, Aragorn decided to\nlay aside his claim for the time being. He knew that if he aggressively\npromoted his claim, rival claimants or debates as to his legitimacy were\nnot out of the question, and this could be a fatal distraction for\nGondor at a time when the West needed to be united against Sauron. So,\nto avoid conflict, after he had healed people during the following\nnights of March 15–16, he left Minas Tirith and symbolically refused to\nenter it again until he was crowned King on May first.\n\nAs Reunited King of Gondor and Arnor\n\n\n\nUpon Sauron's defeat, Aragorn was crowned as KING ELESSAR, a name given\nto him by Galadriel. He became the TWENTY-SIXTH KING OF ARNOR,\nTHIRTY-FIFTH KING OF GONDOR and the first HIGH KING OF THE REUNITED\nKINGDOM, though it would be several years before his authority was\nfirmly reestablished in Arnor. His line was referred to as the House of\nTelcontar (Telcontar being Quenya for “Strider”). Aragorn married Arwen\nshortly afterwards, and ruled the Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor until 120\nof the Fourth Age. His reign was marked by great harmony and prosperity\nwithin Gondor and Arnor, and by a great renewal of cooperation and\ncommunication among Men, Elves, and Dwarves, fostered by his vigorous\nrebuilding campaign following the war. Aragorn led the forces of the\nReunited Kingdom on military campaigns against some Easterlings and\nHaradrim, re-establishing rule over much territory that Gondor had lost\nin previous centuries.\nDuring his coronation, Aragorn sang Elendil's Oath: _“Et Eärello\nEndorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta!”_\n(“Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. In this place I will\nabide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.”)\n\nDeath and End of Reign\n\n\n\nWhen in the year 120 of the Fourth Age, King Elessar realised his days\nwere at an end, he went to the House of the Kings in the Silent Street.\nHe said farewell to his son Eldarion and his daughters and gave Eldarion\nhis crown and sceptre. Arwen remained at Aragorn's side until he died.\nShortly a year after Aragorn died, Arwen soon died of a broken heart.\nEldarion began his reign as the Second King of the Reunited Kingdom\nafter his father's and mother's death.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nTolkien gives a brief but detailed description of him in _The Lord of\nthe Rings_: lean, dark, tall, with “a shaggy head of dark hair flecked\nwith grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keen grey eyes.”\n\nIn _The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen_, he was said to be often grim and\nsad, with unexpected moments of levity. Some time after the\npublications of the books, Tolkien wrote that he was six feet six inches\ntall.\n\nAragorn possessed Elven wisdom due to his childhood in Rivendell with\nElrond and the foresight of the Dúnedain. He was also a skilled healer,\nnotably with the plant _Athelas_ (also known as Kingsfoil). He was also\na mighty warrior and an unmatched commander; after the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields, he, Éomer, and Imrahil were said to be left unscathed,\neven though they had been in the thick of the fighting.\n\nThough there is no indication of his ever doubting his role and destiny\nas the future king of the Reunited Kingdom and one of the leaders of the\nwar against Sauron (as he did in Peter Jackson's film), he was not\nimmune to self-doubt, as he doubted the wisdom of his decisions while\nleading the Fellowship after the loss of Gandalf in Moria, and blamed\nhimself for many of their subsequent misfortunes.\n\nOn one occasion, his pride (or reverence for his heritage) led to\ncomplications, as he refused to disarm and leave his sword Andúril (a\npriceless heirloom of Númenor and one of the weapons which slew Sauron)\nat the door of Edoras, as Théoden had required, and only did so after\nGandalf left his own sword (also of high lineage) behind. Even so, he\nswore that death would come to anyone else who touched it (whether by\nhis own hand or by some magic, it is left unsaid).\n\nHe also appeared to possess a nigh-indomidable will. At one point, he\nwas able to psychically challenge Sauron for control of the Palantir of\nOrthanc, and proved victorious in that struggle. It should be noted that\neven Gandalf the White was reluctant to use the Palantir for fear of\nchallenging Sauron directly and revealing himself to the Dark Lord. He\nwas accounted as “the hardiest of living Men” during his lifetime.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _ARAGORN_ means “Revered King”, from the Sindarin _ara_\n(“king”) and _(n)gorn_ (“revered”).. Aragorn was named after Aragorn\nI.\n\nOther names\n\n-   ELESSAR - Aragorn's name as king (Quenya)\n-   EDHELHARN - Sindarin translation of Elessar\n-   ELFSTONE - Westron translation of Elessar\n-   ESTEL - Aragorn's nickname during his childhood in Rivendell. It\n    means “Hope”\n-   LONGSHANKS - Used by Samwise Gamgee and some of the Men of Bree\n-   STICK-AT-NAUGHT STRIDER - Used by the Men of Bree, particularly Bill\n    Ferny \n-   STRIDER - Used by the Men of Bree\n-   TELCONTAR - Quenya translation of Strider and the name of his House\n-   THORONGIL - Aragorn's alias during his travels to Rohan and Gondor.\n    It means “Eagle of the Star”\n-   WINGFOOT - Given by Éomer\n\nTitles\n\nAs king, Aragorn had many titles:\n\n-   THE DÚNADAN\n-   CHIEFTAIN OF THE DÚNEDAIN\n-   HEIR OF ISILDUR\n-   KING OF ALL THE DÚNEDAIN\n-   KING OF THE WEST\n-   LORD OF THE DÚNEDAIN\n-   ENVINYATAR - “the Renewer”\n-   KING OF GONDOR\n-   KING OF ARNOR\n-   HIGH KING OF GONDOR AND ARNOR\n-   LORD OF THE HOUSE OF TELCONTAR\n\n\nWeapons\n\n\n\nAs a Ranger, Aragorn was trained to be proficient with various weapons,\nsuch as bows, knives, spears and swords In battle he focused primarily\non his sword play, preferring close combat to a long scale fight. He was\na mighty warrior, and as such easily defeated many types of foes,\nranging from large groups of orcs to far more powerful foes such as\nTrolls and Ringwraiths, evident throughout various battles like Helm's\nDeep and the Morannon. In each case, Aragorn's finesse in battle has\nserved him greatly and earned him much recognition and respect from both\nthe Fellowship of the Ring and the people of Rohan and Gondor. He was\narguably the greatest swordsman of the Third Age, surpassing the likes\nof Faramir, Boromir and perhaps even Elrond.\n\nAragorn's sword is Andúril, Flame of the West, the reforged sword\nNarsil, Elendil's blade that Isildur used to cut the One Ring from\nSauron's hand. Aragorn uses it with the same skill the Numenoreans had\nlong ago.\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nThe restoration of the line of Elendil to the throne of Gondor is a\nsubplot of _The Lord of the Rings_; Aragorn's adventures not only aid\nFrodo in his Quest, but also bring him closer to his own kingship which,\nthough his by right and lineage, has been left open for centuries due to\nhistorical, legal, and military circumstances. The people of Gondor have\nbeen under the rule of the Stewards of Gondor for centuries, as it was\nwidely doubted that any of the royal line still lived. Shortly after\nIsildur's departure, Meneldil, son of Anárion, had severed Gondor from\nArnor politically, although the formal title of High King remained with\nthe northern line (as Isildur was Elendil's eldest son). This\narrangement had been reinforced by the Steward Pelendur in nearly 2,000\nyears before when he rejected Arvedui's claim to the Throne of Gondor\nduring a Gondorian succession crisis (Eärnil, a member of the House of\nAnárion, was eventually chosen as King instead). It is worth noting,\nhowever, that Arvedui had also based his claim on the fact that he had\nmarried a descendant of Anárion: thus, Aragorn was technically a\ndescendant of not only Elendil and Isildur but of Anárion as well.\n\n\nConcept and creation\n\nIdentity\n\nThe “first term” of the character that later evolved into Aragorn or\nStrider was a peculiar hobbit met by Bingo Bolger-Baggins (precursor of\nFrodo Baggins) at the inn of The Prancing Pony. His description and\nbehavior, however, was already quite close to the final story, with the\ndifference that the hobbit wore wooden shoes, and was nicknamed Trotter\nfor the “clitter-clap” sound that they produced. He was also accounted\nto be “one of the wild folk — rangers”, and he played the same role in\nFrodo's journey to Rivendell as in _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\nLater Tolkien hesitated about the true identity of “Trotter” for a long\ntime. One of his notes suggested that the Rangers should not be hobbits\nas originally planned, and that this would mean that Trotter was either\na Man, or a hobbit who associated himself with the Rangers and was “very\nwell known” (within the story). The latter suggestion was linked to an\nearly comment of Bingo: “I keep on feeling that I have seen him\nsomewhere before”. Tolkien made a proposal that Trotter might be Bilbo\nBaggins himself, but rejected that idea.\n\nAnother suggestion was that Trotter was “Fosco Took (Bilbo's first\ncousin), who vanished when a lad, owing to Gandalf”. This story was\nfurther elaborated, making Trotter a nephew of Bilbo, named Peregrin\nBoffin, and an elder cousin of Frodo. He was said to have run away after\nhe came of age, some twenty years before Bilbo's party, and had helped\nGandalf in tracking Gollum later. A hint was also given as to why\nTrotter wore wooden shoes: he had been captured by the Dark Lord in\nMordor and tortured, but saved by Gandalf; a note was added by Tolkien\nin the margin, saying that it would later be revealed that Trotter had\nwooden feet.\n\nThe conception of Trotter being a hobbit was discarded with the\nfollowing recommencing of writing; another short-lived idea was to make\nTrotter “a disguised elf − friend of Bilbo's in Rivendell”, and a scout\nfrom Rivendell who “pretends to be a ranger”.\n\nQuite soon Tolkien finally settled on the Mannish identity of Trotter,\nfrom the beginning introducing him as a “descendant of the ancient men\nof the North, and one of Elrond's household”, as well as the name\nAragorn. While the history of Númenor and the descendants of Elros and\nElendil were not fully developed, the terms of it were in existence, and\nwould come to be connected with The Lord of the Rings as the character\nof Aragorn developed. Thus the evolution of the history of the Second\nand Third Ages was dependent on the bringing of Trotter to association\nwith them.\n\nFurther character developments\n\nThe development of Aragorn's connection to Gondor was long and complex,\nas was his association with Boromir. Initially it is said that Aragorn's\nforefathers were the exiles of Númenor who ruled over the people of Ond\n(early name of Gondor), but were driven out by the Wizard King “when\nSauron raised a rebellion”. The story of the two branches of Elendil's\ndescendants ruling over two kingdoms of Men through many generations\nonly emerged gradually; at one time, Tolkien even seems to have\nconceived only three generations between Isildur and Aragorn.\n\nOne significant feature which was not established until late stages was\nAragorn's relationship with Arwen. When Tolkien first introduced Éowyn,\nthe interest which she showed towards Aragorn was not one-sided, with\nsuggestions in notes that they would marry at the end of the story.\nAnother proposal was done soon, that Éowyn would die to save or avenge\nThéoden, and Aragorn would never marry after her death.\n\nThe first mention of Elrond's daughter, named Arwen Undomiel, was in\nreference to the banner which she made for Aragorn, but Tolkien did not\ngive any hint whether she had any further part to play. The references\nto her marriage with Aragorn were made later, but it was explicitly\nstated only near the completion of the book. It is only in his working\non the appendices for The Lord of the Rings that Tolkien recorded the\nfull tale of Aragorn and Arwen.\n\nA passing idea was that Galadriel gave her Ring to Aragorn, and that he\nwould accordingly be titled the “Lord of the Ring”.\n\nRejected names\n\nThe original nickname TROTTER was retained for a long while, and Tolkien\ndecided to change it to Strider only after the story was completed.\nThere were also several experimental translations of Trotter to\nSindarin: Padathir, Du-finnion and Rimbedir, with Ecthelion possibly\nbeing equivalent to Peregrin (Boffin). Instead of the latter title “the\nDúnadan”, Quenya Tarkil (“Noble Man”) was first used, synonym with\nNúmenórean.\n\nTolkien hesitated for some time about Trotter's “real” name. Although\nAragorn was the first suggestion when the Mannish descent was settled,\nit was changed a number of times. At one point Tolkien decided that an\nElvish name does not suit a Man, and thus altered it from Aragorn via\nElfstone to Ingold, where the last one is an Old English name with ing-\nrepresenting “west”. Later, however, a new plot element was introduced:\nGaladriel's gift of a green stone, and Tolkien reverted the usage to\nElfstone in order to make an additional connection. This was retained\ninto the final version of the legendarium as a side name and a\ntranslation of Elessar.\n\nAmong other names to be used instead of Elfstone Tolkien considered\nElfstan, Elfmere, Elf-friend, Elfspear, Elfwold and Erkenbrand, with\nvarious Elvish forms: Eldamir, Eldavel, Eledon, and Qendemir. The name\nof Aragorn's father also passed through many transient forms: Tolkien\nintended Aramir or Celegorn to go in pair with Aragorn before settling\nupon Arathorn; Elfhelm and Eldakar with Elfstone and Eldamir; and Ingrim\nwith Ingold.\n\n\nHistory and Mythology\n\nRichard J. Finn presented a paper entitled “Arthur and Aragorn -\nArthurian Influence in LOTR at the Forty-First International Congress on\nMedieval Studies”. The are additional similarities between Aragorn and\nArthur beyond those pointed out by Finn. Arthur is descended from Kings\nof Goddodin - Coel Hen, Aragorn becomes King of Gondor. Kings of the\nperiod in Goddodin lived at both Traprain Law and Din Eidyn (Edinburgh,\nstill known as _Dùn Éideann_ in Scottish Gaelic) remarkably similar to\nDúnadan. For “Men of the North”, Goddodin was a far northern kingdom.\nArthur was crowned by St. Dubriticus, who wore a long gray robe for\nwhich he was called “His Grey Eminence” - Gandalf the White also wore a\ngray robe at Aragorn's coronation to indicate he at one time was Gandalf\nthe Grey.",

    "text": "BOROMIR was a valiant warrior known in Gondor for his greatness, having\nalready achieved great merit in Gondor prior to the Council of Elrond.\nHe is the eldest son of Denethor II, who was Steward of Gondor during\nthe War of the Ring, and his wife Finduilas. Even the people of Rohan\nadmired him, particularly Éomer. He is the older brother of Faramir.\n\n\nBiography\n\nBefore the War of the Ring\n\n\n\nBoromir was born in the year TA 2978. He was the eldest child of\nDenethor II (the penultimate Steward of Gondor) and his wife Finduilas,\nand would have taken over as Steward after Denethor's death, had he\nlived. When Boromir was only ten years old, his mother died.\nConsequently, his father became a grim person and visibly preferred\nBoromir over his brother, Faramir. Despite this fact, Boromir looked\nafter his younger brother and they became very close. Boromir devoted\nhimself to leading his people and fought in the battle for the eastern\npart of Osgiliath. He, his brother, and two others were the only\nsurvivors of the unit that held the bridge until its destruction; they\nhad to swim the river Anduin to reach safety.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nBoromir, by order of his father, Denethor, set out from Minas Tirith to\nRivendell to decipher a riddle that was given to him and his brother in\ntheir dreams:\n\n    _Seek for the Sword that was broken,_\n    _In Imladris it dwells,_\n    _There shall be counsels taken,_\n    _Stronger than Morgul-spells._\n    _There shall be shown a token,_\n    _That Doom is near at hand,_\n    _For Isildur's Bane shall waken,_\n    _And the Halfling forth shall stand._\n\nBoromir lost his horse in Tharbad and travelled the rest of the way on\nfoot. The journey took 110 days. He arrived at the beginning of the\nCouncil of Elrond where he talked about how Gondor was defending itself\nfrom Mordor and tried to convince them to give the One Ring to Gondor\nwhere he felt it would be kept safe. But the council disagreed with the\nOne Ring's being taken to Gondor, deciding that the only safe course was\nto destroy it.\n\nBoromir joined the Fellowship of the Ring and was warned by Elrond to\nnot blow the Horn of Gondor until they were close to Gondor and in dire\nneed. He proved his worth as a capable warrior in the Mines of Moria,\nand assisted Aragorn in fighting off a large number of orcs and goblins.\nAfter the loss of Gandalf and the Fellowship's departure of Moria,\nBoromir expressed opposition to Aragorns decision to continue to Lorien,\nargueing that to go south was better. He believed that stories told in\nGondor of the Galadriel's magic would harm them. He eventually agreed to\ngo after Aragorn assured him the elves would help them. In Lothlórien,\nBoromir was disturbed by what he felt was Galadriel's testing of his\nmind, and he was suspicious of her motives. Before leaving Lothlórien\nhe was given the gift of an elven-cloak and a golden belt.\n\nBoromir disliked the idea of destroying the One Ring, as he believed\nthat it could be used to defeat Sauron once and for all, to save Gondor,\nand return it to its former glory; he tried to convince Frodo to give\nhim the Ring. When Frodo refused, Boromir tried to take it by force but\nthe hobbit put it on and fled.\n\nAfter Boromir realized his actions were caused by the corruption of the\nOne Ring, he repented, and upon returning to camp he was confronted by\nAragorn about Frodo. Boromir told Aragorn that he had seen Frodo an hour\nago where he had tried to convince Frodo to bring the One Ring to Minas\nTirith. They then had an argument and Frodo walked off. After the\nargument Boromir went for a walk, until eventually returning to the\ncamp. The Fellowship, especially Aragorn, believed that there was more\nto the confrontation than Boromir was telling them, but Aragorn did not\npress the issue. Upon hearing of Frodo's predicament, the rest of the\nFellowship, particularly the Hobbits, scattered in an ill-concieved\nattempt to find him. Aragorn ordered Boromir to follow and look after\nMerry and Pippin while he took off after Sam.\n\nDuring the search, Merry and Pippin ran into a group of Uruk-Hai,\nwho tried to capture them. Boromir came to their aid and drove the orcs\noff, but more orcs came and Boromir was mortally wounded by many arrows.\nAragorn found him dying under a tree, with Merry and Pippin gone. He\nstayed with Boromir until he died from his wounds.\n\nAragorn, Legolas, and Gimli laid his body inside one of the boats of\nLórien, and sent him down the Falls of Rauros. Afterwards, they sang the\nLament for Boromir.\n\nLegacy\n\n\n\nThree days after Boromir's death, his brother Faramir saw his funeral\nboat passing down the Anduin. Men of Gondor found Boromir's horn, the\nHorn of Gondor, broken in twain, and brought it to his father. This\ndrove Denethor to despair, and when compounded with Faramir's later\nseemingly-mortal wounding and his knowledge of Mordor's indomitable\nmight, he lost his mind. Many, including Faramir, often lamented\nBoromir's passing as Sauron readied his forces to attack, noting that\nhis loss would be keenly felt by Gondor on the field of battle.\n\nBoromir won respect even from his enemies: in _The Two Towers_, Ugluk\nboasts that it was the Uruk-hai who “slew the mighty warrior,” a clear\nreference to Boromir.\n\n\nPersonality\n\nBoromir was above all else exceedingly valiant and steadfast, and was\nheld in great esteem by the fighting men of many nations. He was noted\nas being somewhat dissimilar in manner and thought from both his father,\nDenethor, and his brother Faramir, but he loved them both greatly. He\nwas selfless and bold, but he took little interest in the books and\nscrolls that his brother so often read, having little interest in lore.\nIt was said of him by Éomer that he had a great deal in common with the\npeople of Rohan. However, his desire to protect his people, and his\ninability to do so, left him vulnerable to the predations of the One\nRing. This eventually caused him to attempt to take it from Frodo,\nthough he deeply regretted this almost immediately after it occurred. At\none point, when envisioning he would have hoped to achieve if he took\nthe One Ring and overthrew Sauron, his world after Sauron's defeat was\none of peace and security, where he used the Ring to rule with wisdom\nand generosity.",

    "text": "ARWEN was the Half-Elven daughter of Elrond and Celebrían. She was often\ncalled ARWEN UNDÓMIEL or “EVENSTAR”.\n\nIn marrying Aragorn II Elessar after the War of the Ring, she became\nQueen of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor, and like Beren and\nLúthien before her, she united Elf and Man in peaceful love and harmony,\nin the process becoming mortal.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nArwen was born in TA 241, to Lord Elrond and Lady Celebrían of\nRivendell. Like her father and brothers, she had the right to choose\nbetween immortality or mortal life. She lived most of her life in\nRivendell and Lothlórien interchangeably.\n\nThird Age\n\nAragorn and Arwen\n\n\n\nDuring Aragorn's twentieth year, he met Arwen for the first time in\nRivendell, where he lived under Elrond's protection. Arwen, then over\n2700 years old, had recently returned to her father's home after living\nfor a while with her grandmother Galadriel in Lórien. Aragorn fell in\nlove with Arwen at first sight, and at first mistook her for Lúthien,\nthinking he had fallen into a dream.\n\nAbout thirty years later, the two were reunited in Lórien, where Arwen\nreciprocated Aragorn's love and they “plighted their troth” (promised\nthemselves to each other) on the mound of Cerin Amroth, choosing to\nbecome mortal and to stay in Middle-earth with Aragorn, and giving up\nthe chance to sail over the sea and live forever in the Blessed Realm.\nArwen never broke faith with Aragorn, even when he went to war. While\nthe War in the South raged on, Arwen wove a banner for Aragorn, which\nwould become his standard after he became king.\n\n\n\nBefore taking the Paths of the Dead, Aragorn was met by a group\nconsisting of Dúnedain, and Arwen's brothers, Elladan and Elrohir. They\nbrought to him a banner of black cloth: a gift made by Arwen, and a sign\nthat encouraged him to take the difficult path. When the banner was\nunfurled at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields to reveal the emblem of\nElendil in Mithril, gems, and gold, it was the first triumphant\nannouncement of the King's return.\n====After the War==== \n\nArwen arrived at Minas Tirith after Aragorn had become King of Gondor\nand Arnor, and they married on Midsummer's Day in the year TA 3019,\nafter the end of the War of the Ring. She became Queen of the Reunited\nKingdoms of Arnor and Gondor. After marrying Aragorn, she bestowed upon\nFrodo Baggins a gift: Her place on the ships to Valinor. She bore\nAragorn's son, Eldarion, and several unnamed daughters, some time during\nthe Fourth Age.\n\nFourth Age\n\nIn the year 121 of the Fourth Age, after Aragorn's death, Arwen died of\na broken heart at Cerin Amroth in Lórien, and was buried there one\nyear after the death of Aragorn, to whom she had been wedded for 122\nyears. She was 2901 years old.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Arwen_ means “Noble Maiden”, from the Sindarin word _ar(a)_\n(“royal, noble”) and _wen_ (“maiden”). Her epessë UNDÓMIEL means\n“Evenstar”, from the Quenya _Undómë_ (“evening twilight”) and _el_\n(“star”).\n\n\nCharacter\n\nArwen was described to be the most beautiful of the last generation of\nHigh Elves in Middle-Earth, and was even said to bear a remarkable\nresemblance to her ancestress, Lúthien. Tolkien described Arwen as\nfollowing:\n\n_On Fellowship of the Ring's film version, Arwen proved wise. She proved\ncourage and kind as shown when she risked her own life and defied the\nNazgul to protect Frodo as well as acting to heal Frodo's wounds. She\nalso showed a great sense of humour when she traded barbs with Aragorn.\nShe also loved Aragorn so much she was ready to give up immortality so\nshe can be with him._\n\n\nLineage\n\nArwen was the youngest child of Elrond and Celebrían; her elder brothers\nwere the twins Elladan and Elrohir. Through her father, she was the\ngranddaughter of Eärendil the Mariner (the second of the Half-Elven),\ngreat-granddaughter of Tuor of Gondolin, and therefore a direct\ndescendant of the ancient House of Hador. Arwen was also a descendant of\nKing Turgon of the Ñoldor through her great-grandmother, Idril. Through\nher mother, she was the granddaughter of Lady Galadriel and the\ngreat-granddaughter of Finarfin. Éomer of Rohan said that the Lady Arwen\nwas more fair than the Lady Galadriel of Lórien, but Gimli son of Glóin\nthought differently. Through both of her parents Arwen was a direct\ndescendant of the ancient Elven House of Finwë. Furthermore, Arwen was a\ndescendant of Beren and Lúthien Tinúviel, whose story resembled hers.\nIndeed, Arwen was held to be the reappearance in likeness of her\nancestress Lúthien, fairest of all the Elves, who was called Nightingale\n(Tinúviel).\n\n\n\nArwen was a very distant relative of her husband Aragorn. Aragorn's\nancestor, Elros Tar-Minyatur, the first King of Númenor, was her father\nElrond's brother, who chose to live as a man rather than one of the\nEldar. This means that Aragorn also has very distant Elvish ancestry.\nElros died in SA 442, some 3240 years before Arwen was born.\n\nArwen eventually became Queen of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and\nGondor when she married Aragorn, who was of the line of the Kings of\nArnor.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring ended, Arwen and Aragorn produced the future\nheir of the throne, Eldarion.\n\nBy Arwen and Aragorn's marriage, the long-sundered lines of the\nHalf-elven were joined. Their union also served to unite and preserve\nthe bloodlines of the Three Kings of the High Elves (Ingwë, Finwë, and\nthe brothers Olwë and Elwë) as well as the only line with Maiarin blood\nthrough Arwen's great-great-great grandmother, Melian, Queen of Doriath,\nand also on Aragorn's side, through the line of kings of Arnor and\nNúmenor to Elros, Elrond's brother, whose great-great-grandmother was\nalso Melian.",

Following his father's death during the\nSiege of Barad-dûr, and Isildur's death at the Disaster of the Gladden\nFields, the kingship of Gondor was committed towards the Line of Anárion\nbeginning with his son, Meneldil.\n\n\nBiography\n\nOrigins\n\nAnárion was born in SA 3219 in Númenor. He and Isildur lived at the\nhaven of Rómenna on the east coast of the island of Númenor. Their\nfather was Elendil son of Amandil, the Lords of Andunie.\n\nIn SA 3262, the Kings of Númenor, took Sauron captive and brought him to\nNúmenor. Sauron allowed himself to be taken because he wanted to corrupt\nthe Númenóreans. He used their desire for immortality and power to\nconvince them to renounce Eru and worship Morgoth.\n\nAs Sauron's influence increased, the Faithful began to prepare to leave\nNúmenor. They filled their ships with many of their prized possessions,\nincluding the Palantíri.\n\nSauron's lies convinced Ar-Pharazôn that he could achieve immortality in\nthe Undying Lands. In SA 3319, Ar-Pharazon set out with a great fleet\nintending to take the Undying Lands by force but when he set foot on the\nshore, Eru caused the Seas to open up. The fleet sank and Numenor was\ndestroyed by a great wave.\n\nFounding of Gondor\n\nThe ships of the Faithful were spared, and a great wind from the west\nsent them to the shores of Middle-earth. Elendil landed in the north,\nwhilst Isildur and Anárion came to the Mouths of the Anduin in the\nsouth. Elendil and his sons established the Northern-kingdom of Arnor\nand the Southern-kingdom of Gondor in SA 3320. Elendil was the High King\nof both realms, but he dwelled in Arnor and committed the rule of Gondor\nto his sons.\n\nIsildur and Anárion had their thrones side by side in the Great Hall of\nOsgiliath, the city they founded on the Anduin. Anárion lived in Minas\nAnor on the western side of the Anduin, while Isildur made his home in\nIthilien on the eastern side of the Anduin. Anárion had one of the\nPalantír, which he used to communicate with his brother and father.\n\nWar of the Last Alliance\n\nWhen Sauron and the forces of Mordor began attacking Gondor in SA 3429,\nIsildur and the royal family were forced to move from Minas Ithil to\nAnnúminas in Arnor. Anárion successfully defended the city and realm and\nwas able to drive the enemy from Ithilien. The War of the Last Alliance\nbegan in SA 3434. Sauron's forces were defeated in the Battle of\nDagorlad and the army of the Last Alliance entered Sauron's realm and\nlaid Siege of Barad-dûr. The siege lasted seven years and many Men and\nElves were killed. Anárion was killed in SA 3440 in Mordor when a stone\ncast from Barad-dûr, either from falling debris or by catapult, killed\nhim.\n\nHis father Elendil later fought Sauron, and his brother Isildur would be\nthe one to cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand with Isildur's broken\nsword.\n\nTwo years later, his fourth child Meneldil becomes the third King of\nGondor, and so his three older children may have been female or they\nmight have died with him.",

    "race": "Elves",
    "text": "CELEBORN was the_' Lord of Lothlórien_', and his wife was Galadriel,\nLady of the Golden Wood. Celeborn was said to be one of the wisest Elves\nin Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Celeborn defended Lothlórien and led the\nassault on the Enemy castle of Dol Guldur. He remained in Middle-earth\nfor a time at the beginning of the Fourth Age, but eventually he joined\nhis wife in the Undying Lands.\n\n\nBiography\n\nOrigins\n\nCeleborn was a Prince of Doriath and a kinsman of Thingol, the King of\nDoriath. Celeborn was said to be the grandson of Thingol's brother Elmo.\nCeleborn's father was Galadhon and he had a brother named Galathil.\n\nFirst Age\n\nAround FA 52, Galadriel came to Doriath. Galadriel was one of the Ñoldor\nwho came to Middle-earth wishing to see the lands and rule a realm of\nher own. She came with the second 'group' of elves from Aman with\nFingolfin and Finrod. Celeborn and Galadriel fell in love and married\neach other.\n\nIt is not clear how long Celeborn and Galadriel dwelled in Beleriand.\nAccording to one story, they left Beleriand and crossed the Blue\nMountains into Eriador before the Fall of Nargothrond in FA 495, but\naccording to another story they remained in Beleriand until the end of\nthe First Age.\n\nAround FA 502, King Thingol of Doriath summoned dwarf craftsmen to set a\nSilmaril in Nauglamir, the fabled jeweled Necklace of the Dwarves. The\ndwarf craftsmen coveted the necklace and especially the Silmaril, and\nthey demanded that Thingol give it to them. When Thingol refused, they\nkilled him and took the necklace set with the Silmaril. The Dwarven\ncraftsmen were pursued by Elves of Doriath, who killed the Dwarves and\nretrieved the necklace. However, two Dwarves escaped and returned to\nNogrod in the Blue Mountains and rallied their kinsmen to seek vengeance\non the Elves of Doriath. An army of Dwarves attacked Doriath and\ndefeated the elves. They took the necklace once more, but Beren again\nreclaimed it.\n\nDoriath was briefly re-inhabited by Beren's son Dior Eluchíl, but the\nsons of Feanor came to try to take the Silmaril. Though Dior's daughter\nElwing escaped with the Silmaril, Dior was killed and Doriath was ruined\nand abandoned.\n\nCeleborn's distrust of Dwarves began at this time. His role in these\nevents is unknown, although in one account it is written that Celeborn\nescaped the sack of Doriath.\n\nThe First Age ended with the War of Wrath and the defeat of Morgoth.\nBeleriand was ruined and sank beneath the Sea. Many of the Ñoldor\nreturned to the Undying Lands with the pardon of the Valar, but\nGaladriel remained in Middle-earth with Celeborn.\n\nSecond Age\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel probably lived for a time in Lindon, a coastal\nregion west of the Blue Mountains. Gil-galad was the High King of the\nelves who dwelled in Lindon. However, many of the elves in Harlindon -\nthe part of Lindon south of the Gulf of Lune - were Sindarin elves like\nCeleborn, and he may have ruled a fiefdom there under Gil-galad.\n\nAt some time early in the Second Age, Celeborn and Galadriel are said to\nhave moved eastward into Eriador with a number of Elves in their\nfollowing. They may have lived for a while near Lake Evendim. Their\ndaughter Celebrian may have been born during this time. They began to\nmove eastward again around the year SA 700 because Galadriel sensed a\ngrowing evil in Middle-earth that she felt duty-bound to oppose.\n\nThe realm of Eregion was founded in SA 750, and Galadriel and Celeborn\nare said to have dwelled there for a time along with Celebrimbor and the\nElven-smiths. The Elves of Eregion had dealings with the Dwarves of\nKhazad-dûm nearby, but Celeborn still distrusted Dwarves and would not\nenter Khazad-dûm, although the Dwarves there had nothing to do with the\ndestruction of Doriath.\n\nThe Elves of Eregion also had contact with the Elves of Lothlórien on\nthe other side of the Misty Mountains. According to one story, Galadriel\nwent to dwell in Lothlórien around SA 1350 to SA 1400 while Celeborn\nremained in Eregion. However, in other versions of the story both\nGaladriel and Celeborn stayed in Eregion.\n\nSauron came to Eregion in a fair disguise as Annatar the “Lord of gifts”\nin SA 1200 and deceived the Elven-smiths, who began forging the Rings of\nPower under his instruction in SA 1500. Sauron forged the One Ring to\nrule the others around SA 1600, and Celebrimbor hid from him the Three\nElven Rings of power that he had made without Sauron knowing of its\ncreation and help. Enraged, Sauron attacked Eregion in SA 1697.\n\nCeleborn led a sortie from Eregion to meet the vanguard of Sauron's\narmy. He was able to drive the enemy back long enough to join forces\nwith Elrond, who brought reinforcements from Lindon. But Sauron's army\nwas greater than their combined forces and Eregion soon fell.\nCelebrimbor was killed, and Sauron took the Nine Rings and at least six\nof the Seven rings. Sauron would eventually be driven back to Mordor in\nSA 1701.\n\nThe movements of Celeborn and Galadriel after the fall of Eregion are\nunclear. Celeborn may have gone to Lothlórien to help strengthen their\ndefenses against Sauron. He and Galadriel may have lived there for a\ntime, but they did not become the rulers of Lothlórien then. The king of\nLothlórien at that time was Amdír, who was killed in the War of the Last\nAlliance at the end of the Second Age and was succeeded by his son\nAmroth.\n\nThird Age\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel may also have lived for a while in Rivendell, the\nhome of Elrond. At some point, they may have travelled to the coastal\nregion of Belfalas in the south to be near the sea.\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel's daughter Celebrian married Elrond in TA 109.\nElrond and Celebrian had three children: twin sons Elladan and Elrohir,\nborn in TA 130, and a daughter Arwen, born in TA 241.\n\nAround TA 1050, the Necromancer, who was actually Sauron, built the\nstronghold of Dol Guldur across the Anduin from Lothlórien. Celeborn and\nGaladriel are said to have returned to Lothlórien to investigate the\nNecromancer and ensure the safety of Lothlórien. But after a time, they\nonce again departed, possibly for Rivendell. Lothlórien remained under\nthe rule of King Amroth.\n\nA Balrog awoke in Khazad-dum in TA 1980. Many of the Elves of Lothlórien\nfled, including Amroth's lover Nimrodel. Amroth followed Nimrodel and he\nlater perished at sea. Lothlórien was left without a leader, so Celeborn\nand Galadriel returned there and became the Lord and Lady of Lothlórien\nin TA 1981. They ruled the realm from Caras Galadhon, the City of the\nTrees.\n\nCelebrian was on her way to Lothlórien to visit her parents in TA 2509\nwhen she was captured by orcs in Caradhras. Her sons Elladan and Elrohir\nrescued Celebrian, but the horror of the experience remained with her\nand she decided to leave Middle-earth the next year to dwell in the\nUndying Lands.\n\nIn TA 2941, Sauron was driven out of Dol Guldur by the White Council -\nof which Galadriel was a member. However, Sauron had been prepared for\nthe attack and returned to Mordor. He sent Nazgûl led by Khamul to\noccupy Dol Guldur.\n\nAragorn came to Lothlórien in TA 2980 and became betrothed to Arwen, who\nwas there visiting her grandparents.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nIn December of 3018, Elladan and Elrohir brought word to Celeborn and\nGaladriel of the Fellowship of the Ring's quest to destroy the One Ring.\nThe Fellowship arrived in Lothlórien on January 15, 3019, and was\nbrought to Caras Galadhon to meet Celeborn and Galadriel on January 17.\n\n\n\nCeleborn at first welcomed Gimli despite his distrust of Dwarves and\nsaid he hoped that there could be friendship between their peoples once\nmore. Then he  learned that the Balrog had been disturbed by an\nexpedition of Dwarves to Khazad-dum led by Balin several years before,\nand that the Balrog had attacked the Fellowship resulting in the loss of\nGandalf the Grey. Celeborn was angry at first and regretted allowing the\nFellowship to enter Lothlórien, but Galadriel soothed him and he\napologized to Gimli.\n\nCeleborn promised to help the Fellowship in any way he could. On the eve\nof the Fellowship's departure from Lothlórien, he discussed what route\nthey might take, and offered them boats to ease their journey down the\nAnduin. The next day on February 16, Celeborn and Galadriel prepared a\nfeast for the Fellowship and gave them gifts. Celeborn gave them further\nadvice about navigating the Great River Anduin.\n\n\n\nLothlórien was attacked thrice by forces from Dol Guldur during the War\nof the Ring: on March 11, 15, and 22. Each time, the Galadhrim led by\nCeleborn and Galadriel repelled them. After the destruction of the One\nRing and Sauron's defeat, Celeborn led a force across the Anduin and\ncaptured Dol Guldur on March 28. The shadow was lifted from Mirkwood.\n\nOn April 6, Celeborn met Thranduil, the King of the Woodland Realm, in\nMirkwood. They renamed the forest the Wood of Greenleaves. Thranduil\nretained kingship of the northern part of the forest, while the center\npart was given to the Beornings and the Woodmen. Celeborn claimed the\nsouthern part of the forest below the Narrows of the Forest to be part\nof Lothlórien. This region was named East Lórien.\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel accompanied their granddaughter Arwen to Minas\nTirith, where she wed Aragorn on Midyear's Day. Celeborn and Galadriel\nthen travelled to Rohan and attended the funeral of the King Theoden. On\nthe way home, they met with Treebeard at Isengard.\n\nWhen Celeborn and Galadriel parted from Aragorn, Celeborn said to his\ngranddaughter's husband: _“Kinsman, farewell! May your doom be other\nthan mine, and your treasure remain with you to the end!”_\n\nCeleborn may have been anticipating the day when his own wife would\ndepart for the Undying Lands while he remained in Middle-earth. On\nSeptember 13, Celeborn and Galadriel crossed the Redhorn Gate to return\nto Lothlórien.\n\nFourth Age\n\n\n\nGaladriel left Middle-earth to return to the Undying Lands in 3021 at\nthe end of the Third Age. Celeborn remained in Lothlórien, but after a\nfew years he began to grow weary. He went to Rivendell to live with his\ngrandsons Elladan and Elrohir for awhile in the early part of the Fourth\nAge. Eventually, Celeborn went to the Grey Havens and sailed for the\nUndying Lands where his wife and daughter dwelled. It is said that “with\nhim went the last living memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth.”\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _CELEBORN_ means “Silver tree”, from the Sindarin words _celeb_\n(“silver”) and _orn_ (“tree”). His original name was TELEPORNO, a\nTelerin name which means “Silver-high”, from Quenyan _tyelpe_\n(“silver”).\n\n\nPronunciation\n\nCeleborn is pronounced ‘Keleborn’ and not ‘Seleborn’.",

    "text": "BALIN was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of\nDwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II\nOakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.\n\nA Dwarf Lord, Balin was old and wise, he was one of Thorin's closest\nfriends and advisors, and was always willing to listen and offer wise\ncounsel. Balin is distantly related to Thorin, and is a descendant of\nthe noble house of Durin.\n\nHe later went to reestablish the kingdom of Dwarves, Moria, but in five\nyears it was reovercome by Orcs, and he was killed there.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\nBalin was a Dwarf, son of Fundin, and likely born in the Lonely Mountain\nbefore the coming of Smaug the Dragon. He had a younger brother named\nDwalin and was one of those driven from their homes when the dragon\nSmaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards he may have lived in\nDunland as a refugee. He fought in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. Many\nyears later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the\nfather of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain\nhimself, but Thráin was captured and lost.\n\nThe Quest of Erebor\n\n\n\nBalin was part of the company assembled by Thorin Oakenshield that\njourneys to the Lonely Mountain with Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf to defeat\nSmaug and retake the mountain kingdom of Erebor. He was the second Dwarf\nto arrive at Bilbo's house, where like his brother Dwalin he played a\nviol as big as himself. Among the Dwarves of the company, Balin was the\nsecond-eldest dwarf on the quest, and loosely, held the position of\ndeputy leader. He led the Dwarves in their escape from the spiders and,\nwhen Thorin was absent, spoke for the party when the Elven King\nThranduil captured them.\n\nHe is described as “always their look-out man”: He spots Bilbo\napproaching The Green Dragon Inn at Bywater, he spots the trolls' fire,\nand he's the first to spot the Elves in Mirkwood. He noted that not even\na mouse had ever passed him on watch, and wondered why he did not notice\nBilbo (hidden by wearing the magic ring) when he was lookout for the\ncompany after escaping the Orcs in the Misty Mountains.\n\nBalin gained respect for Bilbo's abilities, and was the only dwarf who\nvolunteered to accompany Bilbo down the secret passage to Smaug's\nchamber. Of all the Dwarves in the quest, Balin was the only one known\nto have visited Bilbo at Bag End after their experiences on the quest\nfor the Lonely Mountain.\n\nExpedition and Death\n\n\n\nBalin later led an expedition in an attempt to reclaim the ancient dwarf\nkingdom of Moria, hoping to regain both the wealth of Moria and the last\nof the Seven Rings of the Dwarves. Ultimately, the search for the\nring—which conferred great wealth and a curse of greed on its owners—was\nin vain, as it had been recaptured from Thráin II by Sauron. Balin\nhimself was killed by an Orc during his quest to re-establish the\ndwarven kingdom of Moria.",

    "text": "MERIADOC “MERRY” BRANDYBUCK (later known as Meriadoc “Merry” Brandybuck\nI, due to his grandson's birth) was a Hobbit and one of Frodo's cousins\nand closest friends. He loved boats and ponies and had a great interest\nin the maps of Middle-earth. He was also one of the nine companions in\nThe Fellowship of the Ring.\n\n\nBiography\n\nMerry was born in TA 2982. He was the only child of Saradoc Brandybuck\n(TA 2940 - FO 11), Master of Buckland, and Esmeralda Took (TA 2936 - ?),\nthe younger sister of Paladin Took II , making him first cousin to\nPaladin's son Pippin, who was clearly his closest friend.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nMerry was considered the most perceptive and intelligent of the hobbits,\nfor example, even before Frodo Baggins leaves the Shire, he knew of the\nOne Ring and its power. He guarded Bag End after Bilbo's party,\nprotecting Frodo from the various and often unwanted guests. He also was\nthe force behind “the Conspiracy” of Sam, Pippin, Fredegar Bolger (more\ncommonly known as “Fatty”, due to his plump form) and himself to help\nFrodo. Thus, even before the Quest of the Ring begins, Merry was well\nprepared and organized; he assembled their gear and brought ponies. His\nshortcut through the Old Forest served them well, because they avoided\nthe Black Riders and met Tom Bombadil, who helped them. At the\nBarrow-downs, Merry acquired his sword, a work of Westernesse.\n\n\n\nAt Bree, he was not present in the Prancing Pony when Frodo foolishly\nput on the ring; but was outside taking a walk, and was nearly killed by\nthe Nazgûl who arrived. At Rivendell, he was seen studying maps and\nplotting their path. His approval to the Fellowship came with only a\nlittle less reluctance than Pippin's; they were the two to relay news to\nthe people of the Shire about Frodo's journey, but in the end Gandalf,\nbelieving in the friendship and loyalty shown to Frodo and Sam,\nrequested that Elrond allow the two hobbits to come along. At Amon Hen\nhe was captured along with Pippin by a band of Saruman's\nfighting Uruk-hai, but he made a good account for himself, and Boromir\nvaliantly defended him, though Boromir died in the attempt.\n\nEscaping with Pippin into Fangorn Forest, Treebeard and the newly risen\nGandalf the White met him. Along with Pippin, he drank significant\namounts of Entwash, which contributed to speedy gains in height and hair\ngrowth. Accompanying Treebeard to the Entmoot, and later to Isengard, he\nand Pippin were set as guardians following Saruman's fall. It was here\nthat Merry encountered King Théoden of Rohan, and was reunited with the\nremaining members of the Fellowship (save Frodo and Sam).\n\n\n\nSeparated from Pippin when Gandalf took the latter to Gondor, Merry\nswore fealty to Théoden and became his squire. Without permission from\nhis liege, he rode to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in the care of\nyoung Dernhelm (who was actually Éowyn, though Merry didn't know it).\nWhen Nazgûl attacked the Riders of Rohan and Théoden was injured, Merry\nand Éowyn faced the Witch King of Angmar alone. Here, Merry's companion\nrevealed herself to be Éowyn. Battling both fell beast and the Nazgûl\nalone, Éowyn was well assisted by Merry's crucial move: his sword, built\nfor this very purpose, was one of the few weapons able to pierce the\nRingwraith's form, but at a great expense to himself. He cut the Witch\nKing behind the knee as he was about to kill Eowyn. This was enough to\nallow Éowyn to finish off the Witch-king. Merry heard Théoden's last\nwords, but went unnoticed by the honour escort of Riders and was found\nwandering the city by Pippin. He was saved by the healing of Aragorn and\nrecovered fully.\n\nFor his bravery in battle, King Éomer, as the new King of Rohan,\nknighted him and gave him the name of “Holdwine”. During the Scouring of\nthe Shire, he was in the forefront of the Battle of Bywater, using the\nHorn of Rohan presented to him by Éowyn.\n\nLegacy\n\nUpon their return he and Pippin both got married to beautiful hobbit\nwomen. They were also the tallest of hobbits - Meriadoc being the\nslightly taller of the two - taller even than the legendary Bandobras\n“Bullroarer” Took, due to their having drunk large amounts of Entwater.\nMerry married Estella Bolger some time after the end of the Third Age.\nHe became the Master of Buckland in SR 1432 (FA 11). He wrote _Old Words\nand Names in the Shire._ Although he was not recorded as having any\nchildren within the family trees, he clearly had at least one son. At\nthe age of 102, he returned to Rohan and Gondor with Pippin, dying there\naround the year FO 64. He was laid to rest in Gondor, and when Elessar\ndied in the Fourth Age 120, he and Pippin were entombed beside the great\nking.\n\n\nWeapons\n\nSword\n\nMerry uses a short barrow-blade for melee combat in books and video\ngames, but in the movies he loses his barrow blade and instead wields\na Rohirrim short sword and wears a helmet, shield and leather jerkin\nthat were originally made for the young King Theoden. The\nblade dissolved during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields when it was\nused to stab the Witch-king of Angmar (Ringwraith, King of the Nazgûl).\n\nThrowing Weapons\n\nMerry can use rocks to hit opponents from a distance. In _The Lord of\nthe Rings: The Return of the King (video game)_, he uses throwing knives\ninstead of rocks, like all other Hobbits. In his case, however, his\ndaggers are slightly stronger.",

    "text": "AR-PHARAZÔN, also known as AR-PHARAZÔN THE GOLDEN, was the twenty-fifth\nand last King of Númenor. Of all the Kings of Númenor, he wielded the\nmost power, but used it most unwisely; his desire for more eternal life\ncaused the destruction of Númenor and the Change of the World.\n\n\nBiography\n\nAr-Pharazôn was the son of Gimilkhâd, the leader of the King's Men\nduring the reign of Tar-Palantir of Númenor. Ar-Pharazôn grew into a Man\nof great strength, stature, and will, not unlike the ancient heroes of\nthe Edain. In these earlier days, he was good friends with Amandil, the\nfuture Lord of Andúnië and his line of people. However, he was his\nfather's child and thus was instructed to follow in the ways of the\nKing's Men.\n\nAr-Pharazôn became a man of great pride and was eager for more wealth\nand glory. He grew restless in his homeland and was often abroad leading\nlike-minded Númenóreans in the wars that they were waging against the\nmen of Middle-earth. In this he fared well on both land and sea for he\nwon great wealth, and gained great respect as a captain. When he finally\nreturned home, the people rejoiced in him and he was very popular and\ngenerous with the wealth and fortunes he won in Middle-earth.\n\nUpon the death of his uncle, Tar-Palantir, who had no son, Ar-Pharazôn\ndecided to wed his daughter, Míriel, which was against her will. As\nTar-Míriel was the rightful Ruling Queen of Númenor, Ar-Pharazôn was\nable to usurp the throne. He gave to his wife the name Ar-Zimraphel,\nrefusing to use the Elven speech, whilst persecuting the last vestiges\nof the Faithful.\n\nAs time passed, it came to his attention that Sauron, the Lord of\nMordor, was expanding his power throughout Middle-earth and was being\ncalled the Lord of Men. Ar-Pharazôn, ever prideful, resolved to\nchallenge him lordship of the earth. In SA 3261, he marched upon Mordor\nwith an army so powerful that Sauron's forces simply deserted him. But\nSauron was cunning, and he feigned to be overawed at Ar-Pharazôn's\nmight. However, Ar-Pharazôn did not trust Sauron, and brought him back\nto Númenor as a hostage. However, Sauron quickly took advantage of his\nsituation to gain Ar-Pharazôn's trust, and by way of careful flattery,\nlies and half-truths, he soon became the king's closest and most trusted\nadvisor. He was able to corrupt Ar-Pharazôn, convincing him to worship\nMorgoth in the hope that he would be able to cheat mortality. Some of\nthe results of Sauron's cunning were the erecting of a Great Temple to\nMorgoth, intense persecution of the Faithful, and the chopping down of\nthe White Tree of Númenor. Soon the king and his followers were\nworshiping Morgoth openly and burning innocents at the altar of the\ntemple as sacrificial offerings to appease the false god.\n\nThen, as Ar-Pharazôn felt the bite of old age upon him, Sauron was able\nto convince him to attack Valinor and claim the right to immortality by\nforce. He began the building of a huge fleet, the Great Armament, to\nattack Valinor in SA 3310 and finally broke the Ban of the Valar,\nlanding on the shores of the Undying Lands in SA 3319. The Valar then\nlaid down their guardianship of the world and called upon Eru, the One.\nHe sank Ar-Pharazôn's fleet and all of Númenor beneath the ocean,\nchanging the shape of the world. Valinor was no longer connected to\nMiddle-earth, and mortals could no longer find it. Afterwards, only\nelves and a few remarkable exceptions could reach it following the\nStraight Road into the far west. Ar-Pharazôn and his mighty host who\nlanded on Aman were buried by mounds of dirt and remain in the Caves of\nthe Forgotten until the last battle, or Dagor Dagorath. He and his great\narmy's role in the end of days has not been made clear.\n\n\nLegacy and successors\n\nAr-Pharazôn's tyrannical rule and rebellious resolve to break the Ban of\nthe Valar and make war upon the west led to the end of the royal\nNúmenórean line. Instead, the line of Elros was continued from the long\nline of the Lords of Andúnië. As Amandil of Andúnië did not return from\nhis venture into the west, his son Elendil became the successor of a new\nkingdom that would rule from Middle-earth in exile. His two surviving\nsons, Isildur and Anárion followed him into exile and would in turn\nbecome his successors as well.\n\nAr-Pharazôn was remembered by the surviving Númenorean lineage with a\nsort of grudging respect. Despite his errors, he was the first and last\nHuman capable to beat and humiliate the powerful dark lord Sauron by\nhimself. In remembrance to this feat, in Umbar was erected a monument to\nthe Golden King of Númenor: a dark crystal globe, on a tall white\ncolumn, which absorbed sunrays and glimmered in the night for everyone\nto see. The monument was destroyed when Umbar corsairs swore allegiance\nto Sauron.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis chosen royal name of _Pharazôn_ which means “GOLDEN” was in Adûnaic;\nhis name in Quenya was _Tar-Calion_ with _Calion_ meaning “SON OF\nLIGHT”.",

    "text": "BARD, known also as BARD THE BOWMAN, and less chiefly, BARD THE FIRST,\nwas a man of Laketown, the slayer of the dragon Smaug, and the founder\nand first king of the new Kingdom of Dale. He was succeeded as King of\nDale by his son, Bain.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nBard was descended from Lord Girion of Dale, whose wife and child had\nescaped to Laketown when Smaug ruined Dale and took the Lonely Mountain\nin TA 2770.\n\nIn TA 2941, when Smaug emerged from the Lonely Mountain and attacked\nLaketown, Bard, as captain of a company of town archers, was encouraging\nthe archers and urging the town Master to order them to fight to the\nlast arrow. Bard himself fired many arrows with his great yew bow. He\nwas down to his last arrow when a thrush came and perched on his\nshoulder. Because Bard was of the race of Dale, he was able to\nunderstand the thrush's words. The bird told him of the weak spot in\nSmaug's armor that Bilbo Baggins had discovered. Bard fired his Black\nArrow and struck the hollow by Smaug's left breast and the dragon fell\nfrom the sky, landing on Laketown and destroying it.\n\nBard escaped into the lake and swam ashore. The people wanted him to be\ntheir King, but he said he would continue to serve the Master of\nLaketown for the time being. Bard took charge of organizing shelter and\naid for the refugees and sent messages to the Elvenking of Mirkwood\nasking for help. Then, Bard and the Elvenking led their armies to the\nLonely Mountain, seeking a share of the treasure.\n\nWhen they arrived at the Lonely Mountain, they were surprised to find\nThorin Oakenshield and his company of Dwarves still alive. Bard sought\nreparations from Thorin on the grounds that it was he who had slain\nSmaug, that part of the Dragon’s treasure had once belonged to Dale, and\nthat the people of Laketown were suffering and needed aid. Thorin said\nthat the destruction of Laketown was not his responsibility and he\nrefused to parley with armies camped outside the mountain. Bard sent a\nmessenger several hours later asking for one-twelfth of the treasure,\nbut again Thorin refused.\n\n\n\nBilbo Baggins thought that Bard's claims were reasonable, so one night\nhe went secretly to the camp of the Lakemen and Elves. The Hobbit had\nfound the Arkenstone - the treasure that Thorin most desired - and he\noffered it to Bard and Thranduil to use to negotiate. He also told them\nthat an army of 500 Dwarves led by Dain II Ironfoot was coming from the\nIron Hills.\n\nThe next day, Bard asked Thorin for a portion of the treasure in\nexchange for the Arkenstone. Thorin was enraged, but he reluctantly\nagreed to give up Bilbo's one-fourteenth share. Dain's army arrived the\nnext day, and Bard tried to prevent them from entering the Lonely\nMountain until the exchange for the Arkenstone had been made. A battle\nseemed imminent, but then Gandalf told them that an army of Goblins and\nWargs were approaching. Bard, Thranduil, and Dain took council together\nand they joined forces to fight their common enemy in the Battle of the\nFive Armies. During the battle, Thorin had emerged from the mountain and\nhad rallied Dwarves, Elves, and Men to the attack, but he was mortally\nwounded. Bard laid the Arkenstone upon Thorin's breast when he was\nburied under the mountain, and Dain agreed to pay the one-fourteenth\nshare of the treasure as promised. Bard gave the emeralds of Girion to\nThranduil and Bilbo agreed to take a small chest of gold and one of\nsilver. Bard also contributed gold for the aid of Laketown, and although\nthe Master of Laketown absconded with much of it, Laketown was rebuilt\nand its people became prosperous.\n\nBard went to his ancestral home of Dale at the foot of the Lonely\nMountain. He rebuilt the ruined town and in TA 2944, he became King of\nDale. Bard maintained good relations with the Dwarves of the Lonely\nMountain and trade flowed freely up and down the River Running. People\ncame to settle in Dale from miles around and the land that had been\nwithered by Smaug became bountiful once more.\n\nBard died in TA 2977. His son Bain succeeded him as King of Dale.",

''\n\nGandalf suggested Bilbo Baggins to be hired by Thorin and Company to be\ntheir burglar in the Quest of Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of\nthe Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring, and\nthe first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He\nwrote many of his adventures in a book he called _There and Back Again_.\nBilbo adopted Frodo Baggins as his nephew after his parents, Drogo\nBaggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.\n\nBilbo was the first Hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and\nwas one of the few to visit the The Undying Lands across the ocean.\n\n*He is possibly named after a type of sword popularly used in the 16th\ncentury (which is also called Bilbo)\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nBilbo Baggins was born on September 22 by Shire Reckoning (around\nSeptember 12-14 of our calendar), in the year 2890 of the Third Age. He\nwas the only son of Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took.\n\n\n\nIn Hobbiton, Bungo Baggins constructed a spacious and luxurious\nHobbit-hole for Belladonna, which they named Bag End. The family moved\nto their new home, where Bilbo would spend much of his life.\n\nAs a young Hobbit, Bilbo was curious and eager for news of the outside\nworld. The Istar wizard, Gandalf, took interest in this unusual quality\nin Bilbo during his visits to the Shire. Bilbo would later remember\nGandalf's Fireworks displays in the dwelling of his mother's family at\nGreat Smials. Bilbo apparently practiced his rock-throwing skills in his\nyouth so much, that birds and squirrels fled the area whenever he bent\ndown to pick up a rock.\n\nWhen Bilbo's father and mother died in TA 2926 and TA 2934 respectively,\nBilbo became his own master and spent the next seven years living alone\nin Bag End. During this time, Bilbo grew fond of his life as a wealthy\nbachelor and acquired a reputation for respectability that the neighbors\nadmired.\n\nQuest of Erebor\n\nAn Unexpected Journey\n\nIn the year TA 2941, Bilbo, at the age of 50, was visited by Gandalf and\nthirteen dwarves (The Unexpected Party), led by Thorin Oakenshield.\nThese Dwarves wished to hire Bilbo as their burglar on their quest to\nreclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Bilbo reluctantly\nagreed to go, and the next morning they set off from _The Green Dragon\nInn_.\n\n\n\nThorin and company traveled through the Lone-lands along high hills and\nbeside castles. After approximately one month, Gandalf disappeared. Oín\nand Gloín failed to make a fire during a rainy night, and Balin spotted\na fire in the distance, which was rare in those regions, and sent Bilbo\nto investigate. At the fire were three Stone-trolls, Tom, Bert, and\nWilliam. Bilbo attempted to snatch something from the trolls to bring\nback to the Dwarves, to show that he was a first class burglar. However,\nhe was caught by William, but he escaped and was helpless to prevent all\nthe dwarves from being captured when they came looking for him.\nFortunately, Gandalf came in the nick of time and saved them all by\nimitating the Trolls' voices and tricking the trolls into arguing with\none another until daybreak, which turned them all to stone. After\nrescuing the party, the wizard led Bilbo and the party to the trolls'\ncave, which the latter used to hide their treasure and shield themselves\nfrom the sun during the daylight hours. In the cave, a number of weapons\nwere found, _Glamdring_ (Beater) and _Orcrist_ (Biter) among them. Bilbo\ntook an Elvish dagger from the trolls' collection, no longer than a\nsmall knife in size, which he would later name _Sting_. He kept it with\nhim for the rest of his adventure, wearing it inside his breeches.\n\nIn June they came to Rivendell. During their visit Bilbo met Elrond, and\nbecame enchanted with the Elves. On midsummer eve Elrond inspected the\nswords of Thorin and Gandalf, and looked at Thrór's Map. Elrond\nexplained that the swords were forged in Gondolin and were named Orcrist\nand Glamdring. When inspecting the map Elrond found Moon letters that\nspoke of the back door of Erebor, which read: _Stand by the grey stone\nwhen the thrush knocks, and the setting sun with the last light of\nDurin's Day will shine upon the keyhole._\n\nDiscovery of the One Ring\n\nBilbo and his companions then travelled from Rivendell and made their\nway to the Misty Mountains. It was here the companions encountered and\nfled from the Great Goblin and his immense forces. Bilbo, unfortunately,\nlost direction during the struggle and fell into a gaping hole within\nthe mountains. Luckily, he survived the fall and crawled his way through\nthe pitch-black tunnel, using his hobbit nose to gain a sense of\ndirection. Bilbo eventually stumbled upon a small ring, but thought\nnothing of it, and put it in his back pocket. Although he did not know\nit, this lost trinket was the One Ring, forged by Sauron many years ago.\nBilbo soon encountered Gollum, who had been in possession of the Ring\nfor over five hundred years. The two challenged each other to a game of\nriddles with the condition that Gollum would show the way out if Bilbo\nwon. However, Gollum was not satisfied with Bilbo's final riddle, and\nwhile mourning his loss, found that his Ring was gone. Gollum then\npaddled back on his boat towards Bilbo, who he then accused of stealing\nhis precious, but Bilbo had vanished.\n\n\n\nGollum, thinking Bilbo had known the way out and was leaving, headed to\nthe exit and was followed by Bilbo. Bilbo was soon reunited with his\ncompanions. Bilbo and the travellers had stopped for the night when\ngoblins and a pack of wargs found them near a patch of pine trees. The\ndwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf climbed up the trees to escape, but the\ngoblins were not going to leave without killing them. They started to\nburn the trees down. The Warg Chieftain was ordering the other wargs\naround when Gandalf picked up a pinecone, and with his magic set it\nablaze in a green fire. He threw it down hitting The Warg Chieftain. It\nrolled around on the ground burning while Gandalf threw more and more\npinecones down. The goblins and wargs fled and the group was rescued by\neagles. When an eagle grabbed Dori, Bilbo had to jump and grab Dori's\nlegs before he was forgotten. This prompted Bilbo to groan “My arms! My\npoor arms,” and Dori to cry, “My legs! My poor legs!” The eagles\neventually took them to their eyrie where they rested and continued\ntheir journey.\n\n\n\nThe group traveled to Beorn's house where they rested, after being\ngruffly taken in by Beorn and his animal servants. Beorn learned their\nstory and gave a large number of provisions to help their quest. Beorn\nalso lent several ponies to be used until the group reached Mirkwood.\nHowever, Beorn did not fully trust the dwarves, so Bilbo saw Beorn\ngiving careful watch to see that his ponies were unharmed. Eventually\nthe company reached Mirkwood, where the ponies were let go (to several\nof the dwarves discontent) and Gandalf left the group as well, warning\nthem, “Do not stray off the path.”\n\nThe Company began to follow the path through the treacherous forest.\nEventually the provisions ran low and the Company was forced to send\nBilbo up a tree to see where the forest ended. Bilbo climbed up a tree,\nwhere a rewarding breeze of cool air and butterflies met him. Bilbo only\nsaw more forest, so when he reluctantly climbed back down, he did not\nsee that the forest ended. He reported his findings to the dwarves,\nwhere they met the news with ill comfort, angry that the dwarves were\nfatter than Bilbo and so could not climb the trees to feel cool air or\nsee the butterflies. Eventually the last provisions were eaten. The\nCompany then came upon the Enchanted River. Bilbo saw a boat on the\nother side, leading the dwarves to retrieve it. A deer came out of\nnowhere when all the dwarves were on the other side. A dwarf shot it\nwhere it died, on the other side. The dwarves hoped for venison for\ndinner when Bilbo realized that Bombur was drowning. The dwarves fished\nhim out, where he was asleep, but the boat was knocked away, ending the\nhope for venison.\n\nWhile wandering down the path, the dwarves saw lights in the forest.\nDeciding that they would rather leave the path than starve to death they\nheaded after the lights. As soon as they got to the lights, they went\nout and one of their party fell asleep. This happened twice. On the\nthird time all of them fell asleep.\n\n\n\nWhen Bilbo awoke in the night, he was alone. He cursed the dwarves for\nleaving the path and discovered that spiders had captured his\ncompanions. Bilbo was forced to find his lost companions and cut through\nthe cocoons the spiders had formed around his companions. He distracted\nthe spiders by improvising several insulting songs to irritate the\nspiders, who left their domain to find the insulter and eat him. Bilbo\nkilled a few by throwing stones at a few spiders and he killed more via\nSting. They never found him, since he used the Ring to turn invisible.\nAfter freeing the dwarves, he led them into a charge against the\nspiders, where Bilbo killed dozens of the arachnids with the help of the\nRing and Sting.\n\nAfter traveling through Mirkwood Forest the dwarves were taken prisoner\nby Wood-elves, who believed that the company had “assaulted” the elves\nwhile they were partying (the bright lights the company had seen in the\nforest). Bilbo avoided being caught by using his ring to stay invisible,\nand followed them into the halls of the elf-king where they were held\ncaptive. Eventually Bilbo was able to rescue the dwarves and soon they\nall arrived at Lake Town, a small town occupied by men where Smaug would\nfrequently attack, though he had not been seen in many years. The group\nsearched the mountainside until they found the secret door. Bilbo alone\nwas sent in to steal some treasure from Smaug. When he arrived, Smaug\nwas awake and sensed his presence. Bilbo put on the ring so as to avoid\nbeing noticed.\n\nSmaug tried to figure out who or what Bilbo was, but Bilbo would not\ntell Smaug his true identity, answering Smaug's questions only in\nriddles. While invisible, Bilbo saw that Smaug had a bare spot on his\njewel-encrusted underbelly. Finally, Bilbo removed the ring and Smaug\nsaw that he had stolen a cup, causing him to go into a terrible rage.\nAfter Bilbo made it out of Smaug's lair safely, the dragon flew off to\nLaketown. Bilbo told a thrush to send word to Bard of Smaug's weakness.\nBard shot the Black Arrow at the bare spot, killing Smaug and sending\nhim to rot at the bottom of the lake, but destroying part of Lake Town.\n\nBattle of Five Armies and aftermath\n\nIn Lake Town, after Thorin Oakenshield reclaimed the mountain, the\nBattle of the Five Armies took place. Beorn, the Beorning chieftain,\njoined the travellers in their fight against an army of orcs. After the\nbattle, Bilbo found Thorin lying on a bed, dying. Thorin praised Bilbo\nand apologized to him for cursing him earlier.\n\nAfter Thorin's funeral, Dain offered him his one-fourteenth share of the\ntreasure, but Bilbo declined, receiving only two small chests, one with\ngold, and the other laden with silver. Bilbo traveled back with the\nwood-elf host that participated in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo\ntraveled with the wood-elves down to Mirkwood, and then went to Beorn's\nhouse with Gandalf. Then Bilbo set out with Gandalf to where Bert, Tom,\nand William had turned to stone. They dug up some of the buried treasure\nthe dwarves had buried earlier, most of which Bilbo offered to Gandalf\nto use to aid the peoples of Middle-Earth. Bilbo eventually made it back to Hobbiton, where he\nfound an auction taking place in which his relatives, the\nSackville-Bagginses, believing him dead, were selling most of his\npossessions to the other hobbits. The Sackville-Bagginses were vexed to\nsee Bilbo alive, since they wanted to live in Bag End themselves. Bilbo\nhad to buy back his sold possessions in order to avoid quarreling with\nthem. Eventually, Balin and Gandalf visited him, where they reported the\ncurrent news of Middle-earth.\n\nReturn in the Shire\n\nAlthough Bilbo returned safely to Bag End with his reward and lived in\nrelative comfort, Bilbo’s life was not quite the same as it had once\nbeen. His sudden return after having been thought dead lost him some of\nthe neighbors’ respect and he was later thought of as an oddity, and\nthere was much talk and false rumors circulated about his affairs and\ndoings. The worst of these problems came from the Sackville-Bagginses,\nwho were angry that they were not able to possess Bag End when he was\nthought to be dead. This jealousy and anger increased when Bilbo adopted\nhis nephew Frodo (a Brandybuck) as his heir apparent.\n\nBilbo ignored these things said about him and avoided the\nSackville-Bagginses as much as he could, even using the Ring once to\nhide from them. Bilbo was very generous with his money and most people\nwere willing to forgive him his oddities. He had many friends especially\namongst the Gamgees whom he consulted frequently on landscaping and on\nthe growing of vegetables. His good friend The Gaffer even allowed him\nto tutor his son Samwise Gamgee. Bilbo taught him to read and write, and\nat some point taught him various bits of poetry and told him tales of\nthe elder days. Yet, he slowly began to become weary of his settled and\nsheltered life at Bag End.\n\n\n\nBilbo was the bearer of the One Ring for six decades, ignorant of its\nsignificance. However, by TA 3001, the Ring had begun to affect him. He\ndid not appear to have aged at all, although he felt older and thin\ninside. He decided that he wanted to partake in one more adventure,\nbefore he found a place to settle down and finish his account of the\nQuest for the Lonely Mountain.\n\n\n\nOn September 22, a farewell Birthday Party was held in his honour, where\nhe announced his intention to leave the Shire, to the shock of his\nfamily and friends. Immediately afterwards, he put on his ring and\ndisappeared, as a joke on his neighbours. He returned to his house where\nhe was confronted by his friend Gandalf, who tried to persuade him to\nleave the ring for Frodo. Bilbo initially agreed, but then became\nhostile and accused Gandalf of trying to steal the ring for his own\nbenefit, which he referred to as his “precious.” Horrified by Bilbo's\noutburst, Gandalf stood to his full height and ordered Bilbo to leave it\nbehind. Immediately Bilbo returned to his senses, apologising and\nadmitting that the Ring had been troubling him lately. After a moment of\ninner struggle, Bilbo finally dropped the ring to the ground, becoming\nthe first ring-bearer to give up the ring on his own will. Bilbo and\nGandalf bade each other goodbye, and Bilbo left the Shire for his\njourney.\n\nOn the same day, Bilbo left the One Ring and his home of Bag End in the\npossession of his relative, Frodo Baggins who was eager to be his own\nmaster despite the loss of Bilbo, for he was not yet ready to leave the\nShire. After his departure, Bilbo wandered to Rivendell and then, after\na rest, accompanied some dwarves to Dale, before returning to Rivendell.\n\nLife in Rivendell\n\n\n\nBetween TA 3003 and TA 3018, Bilbo worked on the written account of his\nadventures, in a book that would later be known as the _Red Book of\nWestmarch_. He also studied the Elvish language and compiled a\nthree-volume history of the Elder Days, which he called _Translations\nfrom the Elvish_. He composed the poem _All that is Gold Does Not\nGlitter_ for Aragorn as well as a much longer poem about Eärendil during\nhis stay at Rivendell.\n\nIn October 3018, Frodo arrived at Rivendell. Bilbo learnt that his\nnephew was on a quest to destroy the One Ring so he gave him the sword\nSting and for protection his mithril shirt. However, he remained in\nRivendell while Frodo travelled south. After Frodo returned, Bilbo had\nnoticeably aged, partially freed from the Ring's effect, although he\ncontinued to desire it.\n\n\n\nSince Bilbo had been a ring-bearer, he was allowed to accompany Frodo to\nthe Undying Lands. On September 22, 3021, Bilbo turned 131, and became\nthe oldest Hobbit in Middle-earth (unless Sméagol is counted to have\nremained a Hobbit). On September 29, he, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel and\nFrodo boarded a ship docked at the Grey Havens and sailed away from\nMiddle-earth. His fate afterwards is not known but as he too was a\nmortal being, he most likely died in the light of the Blessed Realm of\nValinor.\n\n\nCharacter\n\n\n\nBilbo was a very friendly and well-mannered hobbit fond of food, drink,\na full pipe, his friends and good cheer, and was known for greeting\nstrangers and friends with hospitality saying; “At your service and your\nfamilies”. Being related to both the Tooks and the Baggins two family\ngroups that were fundamentally opposite in their mentalities, with the\nTooks being more fond of adventures and wandering, and the Baggins who\nwere more fond of the settled life, Bilbo had two different sides to\nhim, something he referred to as the “Took side” and the “Baggins side”.\nThis meant that he secretly relished having adventures but still wanted\nto remain settled and was very afraid.\nBilbo seemed to be happy with his life at Bag End, and would have been\ncontent to remain a child of his father, had adventure not come upon\nhim. Still very afraid and wishing he had never left his hobbit-hole,\nthe Took side eventually won out, even after he returned home to his old\nlife. Thus, his desire for another adventure never truly departed from\nhim in his heart even into his old age. This he demonstrated in his\nsudden departure from Bag End in TA 3001.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nOther names\n\n-   Bur-a-hobbit\n-   The Barrel Rider\n-   Burglar\n-   Thief in the Shadows\n-   Child of the kindly West\n-   Clue-finder\n-   Guest of Eagles\n-   The Lucky Number\n-   Luckwearer\n-   Old Mad Baggins\n-   The Ring Winner\n-   The Spider Stinger\n-   Stinging Fly\n-   He that walks unseen\n-   Mr. Boggins\n-   The Web Cutter\n\nEarlier names\n\n-   Bilba Labingi, the original hobbit name for Bilbo\n\n\nBilbo's writings\n\n\n\nTranslations\n\n-   _Translations from the Elvish_\n-   _The Fall of Gil-galad_\n\nComposed works\n\n-   _There and Back Again_\n-   _The Road Goes Ever On_\n-   _All that is Gold Does Not Glitter_\n-   _Song of Eärendil_\n-   _The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late_\n-   _A Walking Song_ (Wrote the lyrics)\n-   _Warning of Winter_\n-   _Bilbo's Last Song_\n\n\nAppearances in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Hobbit_ (First appearance)\n-   _The Lord of the Rings_\n-   _The Silmarillion_\n-   _Unfinished Tales_\n\nIn the films\n\n-   _An Unexpected Journey_\n-   _The Desolation of Smaug_\n-   _The Battle of the Five Armies_\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_ (Mentioned only)\n-   _The Return of the King_.",

    "text": "FRODO BAGGINS, son of Drogo Baggins, was a Hobbit of the Shire during\nthe Third Age. He was, and still is, Tolkien's most renowned character\nfor his leading role in the Quest of the Ring, in which he bore the One\nRing to Mount Doom, where it was destroyed. He was a Ring-bearer, best\nfriend to his gardener, Samwise Gamgee, and one of the three Hobbits who\nsailed from Middle-earth to the Uttermost West at the end of the Third\nAge.\n\n\nBiography\n\nChildhood\n\nMuch of Frodo's youth was spent at Brandy Hall in Buckland, the\nancestral home of the Brandybuck family, including his mother (Primula\nBrandybuck). Frodo was known as something of a rascal, befriending\nMeriadoc (Merry) Brandybuck and Peregrin (Pippin) Took and causing\ntrouble wherever they went. They would often steal mushrooms from Farmer\nMaggot's farm Bamfurlong.  \n\nIn TA 2980, when Frodo was only 12 years old, his parents drowned in a\nboating accident on the Brandywine River. An only child, Frodo stayed in\nBrandy Hall until his 99-year-old “uncle” Bilbo adopted him in TA 2989.\nBilbo took Frodo to live with him in his home at Bag End and made him\nhis heir.\n\n\n\nThe two grew very close in the following years; Frodo learned much of\nthe Elvish language during his time with Bilbo, as well as much of the\nlore of Middle-earth. The two shared the same birthday, September 22 by\nShire Reckoning (around September 12–14 of our calendar), and a party\nof special magnificence was held at the beginning of The Fellowship of\nthe Ring when Frodo came of age of thirty-three and Bilbo hit the\npeculiar year of 111.\n\nBilbo gave a memorable Birthday Speech before playing a joke on his\nfellow hobbits by using the One Ring to disappear, at which Gandalf\nquickly reacted and used his staff to create a blinding flash where\nBilbo had been standing. The hobbits at the Party were left confused and\ndisgruntled, and Bilbo was never again seen in the Shire.\n\nBefore departing for his journey to Rivendell, Bilbo had a long\nconversation with Gandalf, who finally persuaded him to voluntarily\nsurrender the One Ring. Bilbo left it on the fireplace mantel with a\nnote for Frodo, who would now become the next Ring-bearer.\n\nComing of Age and Quest Beginning\n\n\n\nAfter the party finished, Frodo returned home and discovered that he was\nnow the master of Bag End and the recipient of Bilbo's magic ring.\nGandalf, ever more curious about the ring's origin, power, and purpose\n(but not yet positive it was the One Ring), advised the young hobbit\nagainst the using the ring. For the next seventeen years, Frodo complied\nwith the wizard's request and hid the Ring in a safe place. However, on\nApril 12, 3018, Gandalf returned to Bag End and warned Frodo that the\nRing was actually the One Ring, which the evil lord Sauron needed to\nrule over Middle-earth. Realizing that Sauron would be looking for the\nRing, Gandalf advised the Hobbit to secretly follow Bilbo's journey to\nRivendell.\n\nAfter Frodo's discussion with Gandalf, a rumor started that he was\nrunning out of money. This rumor, although not begun by Frodo, was\nencouraged by him. Merry helped Frodo to purchase a small house at\nCrickhollow. With the exception of his gardener Sam Gamgee, who had\nagreed to accompany him to Rivendell, Frodo told the other Hobbits of\nthe Shire that he intended to move to Buckland. He sold his home to the\nSackville-Baggins, and, on the September 23, 3018, the day after his\nfiftieth birthday, Frodo left from Bag End, taking with him Sam and\nPippin. They left in the early morning for Bree, and just in time, as\nSauron's most powerful servants, the nine Nazgûl, had entered the Shire\ndressed as Black riders searching for a hobbit with the name of Baggins.\n\nTo Bree\n\nFrodo was unable to find much information about his pursuers from his\nconversations with the High Elves and Farmer Maggot, but what they were\ntold was less than encouraging. When Frodo arrived at Buckland, where\nMerry was waiting, he found that Merry and Pippin already knew about\nFrodo's “secret” journey. Frodo was left with no alternative but to\nbring the two youngsters with him. They cut through the Old Forest and\nthe Barrow-downs in hopes of losing the Black Riders, which did succeed.\nThey met other troubles in those places though, at the hands of Old Man\nWillow and the Barrow-Wights, but were rescued twice by Tom Bombadil, a\nmysterious being who dwelled in a glade in the middle of the Old Forest.\n\nStrider\n\n\n\nIn Bree, the hobbits stayed at The Prancing Pony, an old inn. Frodo went\nby the name of Mr. Underhill, attempting to raise as little suspicion as\npossible. When he noticed a mysteriously cloaked Man sitting in the\nshadows and smoking a long-stemmed pipe, Frodo asked the innkeeper,\nBarliman Butterbur, who the man was. The innkeeper referred to the man,\na Ranger, as Strider.\n\nThat night, black riders arrived in Bree and attacked the inn in search\nof Frodo and the One Ring, but Strider had managed to hide the Hobbits\nfrom them in time. Having gained their trust, Strider introduced himself\nas Aragorn to Frodo and the others, to whom he also revealed the\nbackstory of the black riders, also called Nazgûl or Ringwraiths. With a\npony named Bill that the Hobbits had acquired at Bree, Strider led Frodo\nand his companions into the Wild. Aragorn would be their guide to\nRivendell, and he would lead them through the Midgewater Marshes and to\nthe top of Weathertop.\n\nWeathertop\n\n\n\nOn the night of October the sixth, the Hobbits were attacked by five of\nthe nine Ringwraiths at the hill of Weathertop. In the presence of the\nNazgûl, Frodo made the mistake of putting on the Ring. He was able to\nresist their attempt to take him by drawing his sword and invoking the\nname of one of the Valar, Elbereth Gilthoniel. Unfortunately, the leader\nof the Nazgûl, the Witch-king of Angmar, stabbed Frodo in the shoulder\n(he would have stabbed his heart) with a Morgul-blade. If it had caught\nhim in the heart, Frodo would have become like the Nazgûl, only weaker\nand under their control. The Ringwraiths were driven away by the\nappearance of Aragorn and his martial skill; also because he had\ntorches, one of their few weaknesses.\n\nThough Aragorn was a skilled healer, he could not heal Frodo's wound. A\nfragment of the Ringwraith's blade remained in Frodo's flesh, where it\ncontinued to move towards his heart. Near death (or worse), Frodo was\nrescued by Glorfindel, an Elf-lord, who put the injured Hobbit upon his\nhorse, named Asfaloth. They were pursued by the Nazgûl as Asfaloth\ncarried Frodo to the Ford of Bruinen, at the entrance to the valley of\nRivendell. Once they had crossed the River Bruinen, Frodo turned and saw\nthe Nine Ringwraiths on the other side. They ordered him to give up the\nRing, but Frodo refused.\n\n\n\nSubsequently, the Ringwraiths were washed away in a flood called up by\nElrond, the leader of Rivendell. He was healed in Rivendell by Elrond,\nalthough both of them knew that the wound would never fully heal, as it\nwas as spiritual as it was physical. On the 24th of October 3018, Frodo\nawoke in Rivendell and was reunited with Bilbo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Sam,\nMerry, and Pippin. Although Elrond had healed his wound, it continued to\nbother him for as long as he lived in Middle-earth.\n\nQuest of the Ring\n\nCouncil of Elrond\n\n\n\nAfter his healing, Frodo was summoned to a great Council that Elrond had\norganized. Representatives of all the Free Peoples of Middle-earth\ndiscussed the history of the Rings of Power and decided that the One\nRing must be destroyed. As the ring was shown and tempers flared,\nargument broke out as to who should carry the Ring on this mission,\nuntil Frodo bravely volunteered to take the Ring to Mordor and cast it\ninto the fires of Mount Doom. A member of each of the Free Peoples\noffered to join Frodo in his quest, thus forming the Fellowship of the\nRing.\n\nThe Fellowship consisted of Frodo, Samwise, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn,\nGandalf, Boromir of Gondor, Legolas of the Woodland Realm, and Gimli of\nthe Dwarves. Before leaving Rivendell, Bilbo gave Frodo his dwarf-made\ncoat of mithril mail and his elven blade Sting. The mithril coat had\nbeen given to Bilbo by Thorin after the events of _The Hobbit,_ and\nSting had been taken by Bilbo from the den of a troll. On December 25,\nthe Fellowship of the Ring departed from Rivendell and headed south.\n\nMoria\n\n\n\nOn January 11, 3019, the Fellowship attempted to cross the Misty\nMountains (specifically the Pass of Caradhras), but were unable to due\nto a snowstorm. They instead traveled through the underground city of\nMoria at the urging of Gimli. \n\nMoria (also named Khazad-dum), was the most ancient and grand of Dwarven\ncities, but was deserted when the dwarves uncovered a Balrog, known only\nas Durin's Bane, beneath the city, and had been defeated by legions of\ngoblins. When they entered the Chamber of Mazarbul, the Fellowship was\nattacked by Orcs and a cave-troll. Frodo helped to defeat the troll\nbefore he was stabbed by an orc captain, his mithril shirt saving him\nfrom a deadly blow. The Fellowship ran through Moria to the Bridge of\nKhazad-dum, where Gandalf fell while confronting Durin's Bane. Once\noutside Moria, while the Fellowship was grieving, Gimli took Frodo and\nSam to look upon the Mirrormere, even in their great hurry.\n\nLothlórien\n\n\n\nDeeply grieved by their loss, the Fellowship journeyed to the Elven\nkingdom of Lothlórien, where they met the Lady Galadriel and Lord\nCeleborn. Galadriel showed Frodo a vision of the future in her Mirror.\nFrodo offered her the One Ring, but she resisted the temptation to take\nit, passing the test that was laid before her, and accepting the\ndiminishing of the power of the elves. Before the Fellowship departed\nfrom Lothlórien, Galadriel gave each member a gift. To Frodo, she gave a\nphial with the light of the star Eärendil captured inside; this gift\nwould prove hugely important later on in the quest. They were also\nprovided with elven way-bread, other supplies, and ships for their\nvoyage down the Anduin River.\n\nThe Breaking of the Fellowship\n\n\n\nThe Fellowship continued their journey south to Amon Hen. There,\nBoromir, a Man of Gondor and a member of the Fellowship, attempted to\nconvince Frodo to bring the Ring to Minas Tirith and regroup from there.\nWhen the hobbit asked for an hour alone to consider his options, Boromir\nfollowed him. Seeing that Frodo did not intend to take the suggested\ncourse of action, Boromir tried to take the Ring from him by force.\n\nFrodo put on the Ring and escaped to the Seat of Seeing, where he\nwatched as war brewed across Middle-Earth and the Eye of Sauron\nsearching for him as he traveled.\n\n\n\nTaking off the Ring, he decided to take the item to Mordor alone,\nwithout telling the other members of the Fellowship. However, he was\njoined by his friend Samwise Gamgee, who felt it was necessary that he\nshould protect and guide Frodo. Frodo gave in to Sam's protests, and\nalthough reluctant to lead anyone else to his fate, was glad to have\nSam's company.\n\nThe two hobbits continued toward Mordor, dividing the Fellowship. Here\nBoromir was killed by uruk-archers while defending Merry and Pippin; the\ntwo young hobbits were then captured by Uruk-hai, and were to be taken\nto Isengard. Instead of following Samwise and Frodo to Mordor, the Three\nHunters decided it more important to rescue Merry and Pippin from their\ncaptors. The breaking of the Fellowship was now complete.\n\nEmyn Muil\n\nAfter leaving what remained of the Fellowship at Amon Hen, Frodo and Sam\ntried to navigate through the winding paths of the Emyn Muil. After\ngetting lost several times, they were found by Gollum, who at first\ntried to take the One Ring, but was captured by Sam (with Frodo's help)\nand tied up with the Elven rope. Frodo, now pitying the creature,\ndecided not to slay Gollum, but forced him to swear an oath of servitude\nto the master of the precious. Gollum then led them out of the maze and\ninto the Dead Marshes.\n\nThe Dead Marshes\n\n\n\nThe Dead Marshes followed the razor-sharp rocks of Emyn Muil, and were\njust as disorienting, if not more so. There was thought to be no route\nthrough the marshes, as orcs marched for miles around, although Gollum\nhad secretly discovered a path when out on one of his many errands. He\nled Frodo and Sam on a safe pathway through the marshes, warning them\nnot to follow what seemed like small torches in the water.\n\nIthilien\n\nGollum led the two Hobbits to the Black Gate of Mordor, as Frodo had\ndesired, but stopped the Hobbits from passing its doors, as the danger\nwas too great. He then explained about a secret way into Mordor, 'Up the\nstairs and through the tunnel'. The Hobbits once again found themselves\nbeing led by Gollum. After venturing into Ithilien, and witnessing a\nskirmish between a company of warriors from Haradrim (along with\nOliphaunts) and rangers from Gondor, they were apprehended by the\nranger's captain, Faramir. When the skirmish had ended, Faramir\nblindfolded the ring-bearer and his companions and led them to Henneth\nAnnûn, the Window on the West. Upon much interrogation, Samwise\nfoolishly misspoke, and gave away that Frodo was indeed carrying the One\nRing. Realizing the importance of the quest, Faramir proved his quality,\nunlike his brother, Boromir, and let the ring-bearer go free. Later,\nGollum was captured in the Forbidden Pool and forcibly taken into the\nhidden lair. Frodo begged for his safety, and he was not killed,\nalthough the rift between master and servant had once again begun to\nopen.\n\nMinas Morgul and Shelob's Lair\n\n\n\nGollum led the Hobbits past the lair of the Witch-King of Angmar, Minas\nMorgul, and up the stairs into 'The Tunnel'. When they arrived at the\ntop though, they were abandoned by Gollum. They cautiously travelled\nthrough the tunnel, and managed to get to the end only to find their way\nbarred by Shelob's great web. Whilst attempting to cut through the\nwebbing, Frodo bravely stood up to Shelob and forced her back further\ninto the tunnels giving him and Sam time enough to hack through the\nthreads and escape. Upon escaping the tunnels, Frodo thought himself\nsafe; however, Shelob, through one of her many tunnels, managed to sneak\nout and jab him with her stinger. As he was being encased in Shelob's\nwebbing, Samwise was able to draw her into single combat wherein he,\nusing Sting and the Phial of Galadriel, was able to mortally wound her\nand drive her back into her caves. Sam took the Ring from around Frodo's\nneck upon hearing Orcish voices, and hid behind some nearby rocks. He\noverheard the orcs speaking of Frodo, and Sam realized that his master\nwas not dead, but merely paralyzed. Frodo was then taken to the tower of\nCirith Ungol to await further torture and questioning.\n\nCirith Ungol\n\nFrodo was taken to the utmost top of Cirith Ungol and imprisoned.  He\nwas stripped of all his clothes and all the things he carried.\nSquabbling over his mithril vest, fighting broke out amongst the two\nlead orcs and their battalions, killing almost all the orcs and Uruk-hai\nin the tower. Sam arrived at the gate of Cirith Ungol, only to find his\nway blocked by the Two Watchers; he eventually overcame them, journeyed\nto the tower where Frodo was held, and rescued his master. They fled the\ntower, having to pass the Watchers again (although this time destroying\nthem), and entered Mordor.\n\nMordor and Mount Doom\n\nFrodo and Sam crawled onward through the empty plains of Mordor, as the\nOrcs had been sent to the Black Gate to stop the Men of the West's army,\nand, after falling in and out of a company of Orcs, started to climb\nMount Doom. They journeyed on for many days with hardly any food or\nwater, and Frodo became progressively weaker as the Ring's power over\nhim grew the closer they came to Orodruin. Frodo was eventually unable\nto go on, and Sam was forced to carry him a fair distance while his\nmaster rested upon his back. It was then that Gollum decided to\nreappear, and after a brief struggle, Sam cut Gollum in the stomach, and\nFrodo fled up the mountain.\n\n \n\nInside the Crack of Doom, Frodo finally had the chance to destroy the\nring, and rid himself of his burden, but the power of the ring was at\nits strongest, due to the proximity of the cracks. It was here that\nFrodo finally yielded to the temptation and power of the ring. Sam\nyelled for Frodo to destroy the Ring, but Frodo was overcome by its\npower and claimed the Ring for himself. Gollum attacked Sam, who fell\nand hit his head on a rock, temporarily knocking him unconscious. When\nhe came to he saw Gollum fighting with an unseen foe (Frodo, having put\non the Ring). Then Gollum bit off Frodo's finger, Ring and all, and was\nreunited with his treasure for a short time, until dancing with joy he\ntoppled off the brink and fell into the depths, destroying himself and\nthe One Ring.\n\nThe two hobbits tried to escape as the volcano erupted. Just as it\nlooked as though they were doomed, Gwaihir the Lord of Eagles saw them,\nand with his Eagle companions Landroval and Meneldor rescued Sam and\nFrodo and flew them to safety.\n\nThe End of the War and the Departure of Frodo\n\nThe Scouring of the Shire\n\n\n\nAfter recovering in Minas Tirith, and witnessing the coronation of King\nAragorn, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin all returned to the Shire. When\nthey arrived though, they found it under the control of a man named\nSharkey (later revealed to be Saruman) and his forces. Saruman was\nruling the Shire from Bag End, although he was later murdered by Grima\nWormtongue. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin however, started to gather all\nthe Shirriffs and townsfolk in the Shire, and they successfully defeated\nthe Ruffians employed by Sharkey at the Battle of Bywater.\n\n\n\nFrodo wasn't directly involved in the fighting at the Battle of Bywater;\ninstead, he made sure that no Hobbits were harmed (saying that no Hobbit\nhad ever intentionally harmed another in the Shire and that it was not\ngoing to begin there), and also that any ruffians that surrendered were\nnot harmed.\n\nThe Fourth Age\n\n\n\nFrodo briefly served as Deputy Mayor of the Shire, but soon realized\nthat he still bore the wounds of his quest, and so retired. He was also\nin continual pain from his shoulder wound, which pained him each\nanniversary of their stay on Weathertop. On 22 September SR 1421 (Fourth\nAge), at the age of 53, Frodo joined Bilbo, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel,\nand Círdan aboard an Elven ship. He was allowed passage across the sea\nto the Undying Lands, as he was a ring-bearer, with the hope of healing\nthe damage to his spirit that bearing the Ring had caused. Sometime\nafter the year 61 in the Fourth Age, fellow ring-bearer and best friend\nSamwise Gamgee, reunited with Frodo in the undying lands where it was\npresumed they lived out the remainder of their days.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nFrodo, as described by Gandalf, was “taller than some and fairer than\nmost, (with) a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye.” (_The\nFellowship of the Ring_, Chapter 10, “Strider”)'' ''He was a shy, young\nhobbit with thick, curly brown hair like most other hobbits, and had\nlighter-than-usual skin due to his Fallohide ancestry through his\nBrandybuck mother. He could be described as fairly good looking for a\nhobbit. Frodo is described as appearing thirty-three, even when he is\nfifty, due to the influence of the Ring. Bilbo and Frodo shared a common\nbirthday on September 22, but Bilbo was 78 years Frodo's senior. At the\nopening of _The Fellowship of the Ring_, Frodo and Bilbo were\ncelebrating their thirty-third and eleventy-first (111th) birthdays,\nrespectively. Frodo, like Bilbo, was considered by many others in\nHobbiton to be a little odd. His curiosity of the outside world,\nfascination with Elves and faraway places (like those to which Bilbo\ntravelled in _The Hobbit_) did not fit the general content personality\nof most Hobbits. This curiosity was also attributed to his Took\nancestry. He was very kind and compassionate, pitying Gollum and\nallowing him to guide him and Sam to Mordor despite Sam's distrust of\nthe creature. This act of kindness later proved to be a factor in the\nquest's success in destroying the Ring. The influence of the Ring and\nthe wound by the Morgul-Blade seems combined to have given him the\nability to see into the spirit world, for instance he sees faraway\nevents in his dreams on several occasions. He also can see the ring of\npower worn by Galadriel and he seems to be able to sense danger.\n\n\nWeapons and Attire\n\nFrodo was dressed in typical Hobbit-fashion when he left the Shire: knee\nbreeches, shirt, waistcoat, jacket, and cloak. Colors such as bright\ngreen and yellow were typical for Shire-folk. He was unarmed, save for a\npocketknife.\n\nWhen his little group was waylaid by Barrow-wights, he lost his\nsummer-weight clothing and was wearing a burial shrift when rescued by\nTom Bombadil. When their pack-ponies returned, he was forced to put on\nheavier woollen clothing intended for colder weather. The Hobbits found\nseveral long Dúnedain daggers in the wight's treasure. These served as\nshort-swords for the Hobbits, but Frodo's was broken when he resisted\nthe Witch-king at Weathertop. At Imladris, he removed his Hobbit\nclothing upon finding new Elven clothes that fitted him perfectly.\nTherefore, throughout his quest, he wore a green silk tunic, trousers\ntogether with cloaks made of fur for the first stages of the quest, and\nthen towards Mordor he shed them to wear his tunic and trousers in the\nwarmer weather. Later, his Uncle Bilbo gave him both Sting, a magic\nElven dagger, and a coat of mithril chain mail. The mail saved his life\ntwice, first when it deflected a spear-point in the Mines of Moria, and\nsecond when it turned aside the dagger that Saruman used to try and kill\nhim.\n\nAs with the other members of the Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo received\na special cloak from Galadriel in Lórien, which allowed him to blend in\nwith natural surroundings. Upon being betrayed by Gollum and captured by\nOrcs at Cirith Ungol, Frodo lost all of his clothing and most of his\npossessions. Sam Gamgee saved Sting, however. After the two tribes of\norcs had slain each other in the tower of Cirith Ungol, Frodo dressed\nhimself in Orc-garb. This successfully fooled the Mordor-Orcs they\nencountered, but he dropped the Orc mail and helmet as he and Sam\napproached Mount Doom.\n\nCombat\n\nSword\n\nFrodo used Bilbo's famed short sword Sting for melee combat, it was also\nput to great use as it warns him of nearby orcs and goblins by glowing\nblue.",

    "name": "Celebrimbor",
    "lotrUrl": "https://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Celebrimbor",
    "race": "Elves",
    "text": "CELEBRIMBOR was a Ñoldorin prince, and the last in the line of the House\nof Fëanor, who lived in Middle-earth. He was a ruler of Eregion in the\nSecond Age, and a master smith. He is remembered primarily for his\ncreation of the three greatest Elven Rings of Power: Vilya, Narya, and\nNenya.\n\n\nBiography\n\nFirst Age\n\n\n\nCelebrimbor was the son of Curufin, who was the fifth son of Fëanor (son\nof Finwë and his first wife Miriel) and Nerdanel. During the First\nAge, he lived with his father in Nargothrond, but took no part in the\ndeeds of Curufin and Celegorm regarding Lúthien, Beren, and Finrod. He\nin fact repudiated his father's deeds, and did not follow his father and\nuncle when they were expelled from Nargothrond.\n\nSecond Age\n\n\n\nCelebrimbor settled in Eregion in the Second Age and started dealing\nwith the Dwarves of the realm of Khazad-dûm. In SA 1500, Sauron, calling\nhimself _Annatar_ (“Lord of Gifts”), befriended the Ñoldor of Eregion.\nHe claimed to be an emissary of the Valar, especially Aulë, and\ninstructed them in the art of ring-making. Celebrimbor distrusted\nhim, but the smiths of Eregion were deceived. Under the guidance and\ninstruction of Sauron, the smiths openly made rings to learn the craft,\nbut unknown to them the craft taught by Sauron incorporated a binding\nmagic into the rings.\n\nIn secret, Sauron forged the One Ring, a master ring that would rule all\nthe lesser rings, to enable him to rule Middle-earth via its influence\nover those who used the other rings. When Sauron placed the One Ring on\nhis finger, claiming dominance over all the Rings of Power and their\nbearers, the elves knew his true identity and intentions. Celebrimbor\nand the elves of Eregion defied Sauron by withholding the other rings\nfrom him. The greatest of the rings (aside from the One Ring) were\ncreated by Celebrimbor himself, and these were never touched by Sauron\nand thus were uncorrupted by him, although they were still subject to\nthe One Ring. These were the three Rings of the Elves, the fairest of\nthe Rings of Power. Celebrimbor named them Vilya, Narya, and Nenya after\nthe principal Middle-earth elements of air, fire and water,\nrespectively. He sent the three rings away for safekeeping: Vilya and\nNarya to Gil-galad in Lindon; and Nenya to Galadriel in Lórien.\n\n\n\nSauron retaliated by attacking Eregion, laying waste to the realm.\nCelebrimbor was captured in the chaos and was forced, under torture, to\ndisclose where the lesser rings were, but he would not reveal the\nwhereabouts of the three greatest of them that he had sent away for\nsafekeeping. Celebrimbor died from his torment; his body was shot with\narrows and hung upon a pole, and was later paraded as a banner as Sauron\nattacked the elves. He was the last direct descendant of the line of\nFëanor, save perhaps for his father's brother Maglor, whose fate is\nunknown and is said by some legends to still wander the shores of the\nSea. It is unknown if he married or not or if he had children or not.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis father-name was TELPERINQUAR, which means “Silver-fist” or “Hand of\nsilver” in Quenya. It comes from the words _telpë_ (“silver”) and _quár_\n(“fist”). His mother-name remains unknown. The name CELEBRIMBOR is the\nSindarin translation of his father-name, which comes from _celeb_\n(“silver”) and _baur_ (“fist”).\n\n\nCharacter\n\nUnlike both his father and his grandfather, Celebrimbor was portrayed as\nbeing both selfless and kind, and was neither prideful nor covetous of\nthat which he created. He was described to have an “almost Dwarvish\nobsession with crafts”; he became a famous artificer and smith in\nboth Gondolin and Eregion. His love for crafts took him to Eregion,\nwhere he was introduced to a precious metal and called it Mithril.\nMithril was mined by Dwarves in their nearby Mine Realm of Khazad-dum,\nalso named Moria. Great friendship with the Dwarves of Moria developed,\nskills and secrets were shared between the two peoples for many years\nvia The High Road which was built between the two realms. But a long\nperiod of peace would not last, for upon realizing the trap which Sauron\nhad devised for him, Celebrimbor was filled with anxiety and fear for\nhis people, and was later described as the heroic defender of\nEregion.\n\n\nImportant Works\n\n\n\n-   Rings of Power\n    -   The Nine Rings of Men (with Annatar)\n    -   The Seven Rings of the Dwarves (with Annatar)\n    -   The Three Rings of the Elves\n-   Doors of Durin (with Narvi) \n\n\nOther forms of the legendarium\n\nIn some accounts, Celebrimbor was a Sindar elf, an ancestor of Daeron,\nwho used Feanorian scripts.\n\nLater, Celebrimbor was changed and became of Ñoldorin origin, and a\nsurvivor of the Fall of Gondolin. In the _Unfinished Tales_, a\nstatement claims Celebrimbor to be one of the Teleri who accompanied\nCeleborn to exile.\n\nAnother version of the story has Celebrimbor revolt against Galadriel,\nafter Galadriel and Celeborn established Eregion . Celebrimbor and\nGaladriel were later reconciled once Sauron's trickery was revealed.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptions\n\nVideo games\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrimbor appears in the video games _Middle-earth: Shadow of\nMordor_and _Middle-earth: Shadow of War_, as the wraith assisting the\nranger Talion in destroying the forces of Sauron. Developers have\nrevealed that he assists Talion due to the guilt he feels for creating\nthe Rings of Power, and thus he feels ultimately responsible for the\ntrouble Middle-earth is in. However, the Celebrimbor that appears in the\ngame differs from the Tolkien Celebrimbor in that he not only makes the\nthree Elf rings, but he crafts all of the Rings of Power, and when\ncaptured helps Sauron reforge the One Ring (via the inscription of the\nlettering of the Ring upon it) and assists him in creating the Nazgul by\naccompanying Sauron to the men who eventually would become the Nine; he\nalso gave the Ring a will of its own. However, once Sauron's intentions\nwere revealed to him, he stole the One Ring and used it to command an\narmy of orcs and Uruks to fight Sauron and lay claim over Mordor. In a\nfinal battle, Celebrimbor used the Ring's power of invisibility to\ndefeat Sauron. However the ring wanted to return to the Dark Lord, and\nso it slipped off of Celebrimbor's finger and onto Sauron's, breaking\nCelebrimbor's control over his orc army. Captured by Sauron, the elf was\nthen tortured as punishment, such as witnessing his family tortured and\nkilled in front of him, before finally being beaten to death with his\nown Mithril hammer by Sauron.\n\n\n\nWhen the game takes place and the protagonist, Talion, is slain in a\nblood-ritual, Celebrimbor is bound to the ranger, which allows Talion to\nreturn from the dead (in addition to many other abilities). He has no\nmemory of his past, not even remembering his own name until they find an\nartifact that belonged to him (with the assistance of Gollum,) and with\neach artifact they find more of his memory is restored. Gollum\neventually abandons them, leaving them to find the last artifact in Udûn\non their own. They also assist a low ranking captain named Ratbag\nadvance through the ranks until he advances to Warchief, and kill all\nother warchiefs (leaving Ratbag in charge of all the uruks in Udûn),\nwhich leads to his demise after he is blamed for failing to prevent the\ndestruction of a monument to Sauron by the Hammer of Sauron, a Black\nCaptain and a lieutenant of the Black Hand of Sauron (the leader of the\nuruks in Sauron's stead). Talion (and Celebrimbor) is approached by\nLithariel, the daughter of the Queen of the Tribesmen of Núrnen, who\nclaims her mother has summoned Talion to her chambers.\n\nTheir job finished in Udûn, they make their way to Núrnen and have an\naudience with Queen Marwen (who looks similar to King Théoden when he\nwas enchanted by Saruman), who gives them another artifact from\nCelebrimbor's past.\n\nThis artifact gives the wraith and his host their key to confronting the\nBlack Hand: branding. They begin building their army by branding the\ncaptains and warchiefs of Núrnen (and optionally Udûn), thus enabling\nthem to confront the Black Hand at his fortress of Ered Glamhoth, the\nstrength of his forces depending on how many warchiefs and captains he\nbranded. They return to the queen to tell her they are prepared to leave\nwhen suddenly the Queen begins forcing Celebrimbor out of Talion, saying\nthat they can defeat Sauron “together.” As Talion dies, he tells\nLithariel, Marwen's daughter, to break the Queen's staff, and when it\nbreaks, the Queen becomes youthful again, and reveals she went to the\nIstari Saruman for assistance in helping her people survive Sauron's\nonslaught. Celebrimbor suspects that Saruman may have gone rogue, and\nmay be desiring the One for himself. Marwen nonetheless assists Talion\nby acquiring them a smuggler, which they use to go to the Black Hand's\nfortress.\n\nWhen Talion enters the fortress, a skeleton bound to a pole by rope\nbegins talking directly to Talion, and Celebrimbor reveals that the\nTower of Sauron, another Black Captain and the Black Hand's right hand,\nis responsible for this, and thus is here in the Black Hand's stead.\nTalion approaches the Black Hand's throne, and as he looks for the\nTower, the Black Captain appears in the throne, and reveals the Black\nHand went looking for Talion. He addresses Celebrimbor directly, telling\nhim Sauron forgives him and, if he casts off that “corpse” and becomes\none with him, he will have his dreams fulfilled. Celebrimbor rebukes the\nTower, saying that Talion and the wraith will never surrender.\n\nFailing to deceive Celebrimbor, he reveals to Talion that the Ringmaker\ndeceived Talion by pretending that the Black Hand of Sauron placed a\ncurse on them, binding them together, where in reality Cerebrimbor chose\nTalion as his “host” and could have released him at any time. Talion\ninsists that the Tower stand up and fight, to which the Tower obliges.\nHe creates illusions of himself, forcing Talion to drain the illusions\nto sap the Tower of his power.\n\nAfter the illusions are eliminated, Talion hears his wife Ioreth\nsinging, and when he gets close to her, his wife is revealed as the\nTower, who attempts to brand Talion. However, the ranger overpowers him\nand brutally kills him, stabbing him with his son's dagger, Acharn, four\ntimes in the heart, before shoving his sword, Urafel, into the Tower's\nlaughing mouth. After the Tower's death, Talion reveals his anger at\nCelebrimbor for his deceit, saying he wanted to be with his wife and son\ninstead of being alone alive. Celebrimbor points out though that the\nranger wanted revenge, and thus he gave him the means to do so. The\nRingmaker does admit that he can leave Talion, if he wants. Yet before\nthey can part ways, the wraith says that they must finish what they\nstarted by killing their true target: the Black Hand. Talion reluctantly\nagrees, and the pair set sail for Núrnen once more.\n\nHowever, they find the Queen's palace sacked, and blood on the throne.\nThe queen's crown, however, was left, and when Talion picks it up,\nanother set of Celebrimbor's memories are returned to him. They figure\nthe Black Hand has them in Udûn, preparing an exchange for Celebrimbor\nfor the Queen and her daughter. They arrive in the now-dark, ashed\nfilled Udûn, where they find the Black Hand's elite guards standing\nwatch for the duo. When the Talion arrives at the Black Gate riding a\nCaragor, his branded Uruks and warchiefs are already fighting the rank\nand file Uruks. Then finally, with a warchief and a set of captains, the\nTalons of the Black Hand reveal themselves, along with a host of rank\nand file uruks. To Talion's sadness, The Talons reveal that they\nslaughtered all of the Núrnen tribesman, including Lithariel and Queen\nMarwen. After a brutal fight, the Talons are defeated, and the remaining\nbranded Uruks that assisted Talion remain behind to fight the Black\nHand's forces. Meanwhile, the Gravewalker climbs the Black Gate, and\nfind the Black Hand waiting for him. Then quite subtly, the Black\nCaptain lures the wraith duo in and unleashes a blast of energy that\ngives Celebrimbor more of his memories: his confrontation with Sauron in\nthe fields of Udûn ending in failure, the return of Sauron's ring, and\nthe brutal murders of Celebrimbor's family before his eyes, before being\nmurdered himself. This gives Celebrimbor more power as a result. The\nBlack Hand tells Celebrimbor that when he originally performed the blood\nritual in an attempt to absorb his spirit into the Black Hand's\ncorporeal form (thus reforming an avatar of Sauron, though he would not\nbe at full strength), he gave him a choice: to stand by Sauron's side.\nHe then tells the gravewalker duo that Talion and Celebrimbor have no\nchoice in the matter, and surprisingly performs the blood ritual on\nhimself, absorbing Celebrimbor into the Black Hand and forming the\navatar of Sauron. Sauron tries to kill the already dying Talion, but as\nSauron is about to deliver the finishing blow, Celebrimbor uses his\nenergy to temporarily stun Sauron. This gives Talion the chance he\nneeded to kill the avatar of Sauron, and thus the Black Hand, with his\nsword.\n\nTalion relieved that he has finally exacted vengeance for his family,\nsees Celebrimbor waiting, ready to go to the afterlife together. Talion,\nhowever, insists that together they should use their powers to combat\nSauron, because they both know as long as his Ring exists, he will\nreturn again, no matter in what form. Celebrimbor insists that fighting\nSauron is mortally impossible, because he tried once long ago and it\ncouldn't be done. Talion asks the Ringmaker if he could die knowing\nthere was chance that they could defeat Sauron, but they didn't take it.\nCelebrimbor simply disappears, and doesn't answer. Talion, looking at\nUdûn's red sun, declares to himself and the wraith that it's time for\nthem to forge new ring, as his eyes glow with the wraith's power.\n\nThe two then travel to Mount Doom, and proceed to forge a new ring. Upon\nit's completion, Celebrimbor is separated from Talion by Shelob, and\nTalion takes the new ring to survive without the wraith. He later finds\nhim in Shelob's lair within Cirith Ungol, and gives her the new ring in\nexchange for Celebrimbor. The elven wraith dislikes this exchange\nhowever, but Shelob's natural powers amplified by the ring prove to be\ntoo strong to fight, and thus the duo shifts their attention to a new\ntarget; The Palantíri in Minas Ithil.\n\nAfter the city's eventual fall, Sauron sends 8 ringwraiths to force the\nnew ring from Shelob. Realizing the danger that keeping the ring would\ncause to both her and to Middle-earth, she returns the ring to it's\nforgers. The ranger and the wraith then proceed to Nurnen, where they\nuse the ring's power to build an army and take over the region;\nSubsequently, they are betrayed by an ally in the process, only to exact\nrevenge on him with utter cruelty. Of course, Celebrimbor's cruelty\nhints to Talion that the ring's power is starting to affect the elf's\nsanity.\n\n\n\nEventually, after conquering most of Sauron's domain, defeating a Balrog\nwith the help of Carnan, a nature spirit, and finding out the identities\nof some of the Nazgul, the duo takes their army and march towards\nBarad-dûr, only to be stopped by one of the ringwraiths, Isildur. Upon\nhis defeat, Talion decides to end the fallen hero's torment, and\npermanently kills him. However, Celebrimbor considers this an act of\nbetrayal; he reveals that his plan has gone from simple revenge to\ntyranny, as he plans on brainwashing Sauron and ruling Middle-earth\nthrough him. As Talion objects to this plan, the wraith abandons the\nranger's body and takes over Eltariel's, leaving Talion to bleed to\ndeath.\n\nAs Talion picks up Isildur's ring, he becomes a ringwraith and decided\nto take back Minas Morgul, whilst Celebrimbor and his new host face\nSauron. Eventually, Sauron, in his Annatar form, finds himself on his\nknees, and Celebrimbor begins to brand him. Sauron pulls out a blade and\nslices off Eltariel's fingers, just like Isildur had done to him\ncenturies earlier. With Sauron now having the upper hand, he consumes\nthe wraith, but with adverse effects; they both become the flaming eye\nof Sauron, locked into a battle off wills. The two fought until the One\nRing was destroyed in the War of the Ring, wherein the Dark Lord Sauron\nwas finally defeated.\n\nHowever, Celebrimbor did not fade from middle-earth as Sauron did, for,\nlike Sauron, he had poured his own life force into his own ring. Thus,\nCelebrimbor was freed and the New Ring, now worn by the Elven assassin\nEltariel, started expressing a desire to return to it's creator...\n\nCelebrimbor is voiced by Alastair Duncan.",

    "text": "BOMBUR was a Dwarf who accompanies Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo\nBaggins on their journey to the Lonely Mountain. His brother Bofur and\ncousin Bifur also were part of the company.\n\n\nBiography\n\nBombur's parentage is unknown; the only familial connections mentioned\nare his brother Bofur and his cousin Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's\nline although he was descended from Dwarves of Moria. His birth year is\nalso unknown, however, from Bilbo Baggins' account from the quest to\nErebor it is known that the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of\nthe 13 “by some fifty years” and that after Thorin had been captured,\nBalin was “the eldest left”. Since Fíli was born in TA 2859 and Balin\nwas born in TA 2763, this would put Bombur's birth between 2763 and\n2809, and he would have been between 132 and 178 years old during the\nquest to Erebor. Prior to the quest Bombur probably lived in the Blue\nMountains with Thorin after the loss of Thráin II.\n\nThe Quest for Erebor\n\n\n\nBombur is the twelfth Dwarf to arrive at Bag End. Because he counts for\ntwo, he is the last to enter Beorn's house and the last to cross the\nEnchanted river in Mirkwood. Bombur is first introduced when he tumbles\nwith Bifur and Bofur onto Thorin when they enter Bag End, and he also is\nknocked into the Enchanted river (and falls asleep). He chooses to stay\nand guard the camp, and supplies while the others move up the Lonely\nMountain because he trusts neither mountain paths nor ropes. Later\nthough, he is forced to use the ropes to escape the rampaging dragon\nSmaug.\n\nBombur sleeps at several key moments in the book. When he is violently\nknocked into the Mirkwood River by an aggressive stag, he falls under a\nspell that makes him sleep for days, burdening the others with his\nweight as they walked on. While he is on a midnight lookout in the\nfortified Lonely Mountain, Bilbo promises to keep watch so that he can\nsleep a bit longer and take another watch later (Bilbo used this\nopportunity to sneak the Arkenstone out of the mountain). Incidentally,\nhe was asleep when they opened his barrel after escaping the Elves of\nMirkwood and also when Bilbo discovered the secret entrance to Lonely\nMountain. Bombur is always last and doesn't enjoy it. When the Dwarves,\nGandalf, and Bilbo meet Beorn, Bombur comes last. He comes along\nstraight after Bifur and Bofur so he won't be last. He fought at and\nsurvived the Battle of the Five Armies. Following the defeat of Smaug,\nDain II Ironfoot gave him his share of the treasure and he remained to\nlive at the Lonely Mountain.\n\nLater Years\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings_, many years later, Frodo Baggins inquires\nafter Bombur and learns that he has grown so fat it takes several\nDwarves to lift him to the dinner table. It is unlikely that Bombur\nfought in the Battle of Dale due to his over weight.\n\n\nWeapons and abilities\n\nIn Peter Jackson's Hobbit film trilogy, Bombur can be seen using a\nnumber of different weapons and tools to fight off enemies. His primary\nweapon is an iron ladle, which he wields during _An Unexpected Journey_.\nHe also uses a cleaver or butcher's knife to slash enemies. In _The\nDesolation of Smaug_, he uses the same weapons but usually wields an\naxe. Of course, his greatest weapon is his size which he uses to crush\nand bounce away opponents. Bombur and his family are not classically\ntrained fighters but are lethal with any sort of tool in their hands.\n\nHe also is surprisingly agile for a dwarf of his size and weight. He is\nvery capable of performing stunts such as when, in the second film, he\npole vaults into a barrel. He has an astonishing degree of durability,\nand can withstand a hard landing on a great number of Orcs, and also\nabsorbs an incredible amount of momentum in the process, without\nbreaking a limb or causing himself any visible degree of injury. In\naddition, he is a quick thinker and uses his ingenuity frequently to\nhelp push past Orcs or leap across gaps.",

He had a strong\nfriendship with the Elves, who were half his kin. Biography First Age In\nFA 532, Elros was born inArvernien. In the assault of the Third\nKinslaying by the Sons of Fëanor, Elros and Elrond were taken captive by\nMaglor and Maedhros. Later, Elwing, their mother, cast herself into the\ngreat Belegaer and vanished from Middle-earth. From then on, Elros and\nhis brother were raised by Maedhros and Maglor. They were both raised in\nlove for neither Maedhros nor Maglor were proud of their deeds. It is\nnowhere told when or if Elros and Elrond actually left Maedhros and\nMaglor but it can be assumed that at the time of Eönwë's arrival they\ntook full part in the war. In FA 547, the host of Eönwë and the Valar\nwere seen shining upon the sea and the noise of Eönwë`s trumpets rang\nover the waves. Eönwë summoned all of the Elves and all of the men from\nHithlum to the South, rallying them for the great war against Melkor\nthat was now to come. Second Age Eventually the War of Wrath ended. As\nElros and Elrond were Peredhil, or Half-elven, and only in these two\nremained the line of heroic chieftains of Men in the First Age. The\nValar gave to Elrond and Elros the choice of which kindred they would\nbelong to. Elros chose to be of Man-kind and as such he was granted a\ngreat life-span. Eonwë came among the faithful humans and he taught them\nand gave them wisdom, power, and a life longer than any others of mortal\nrace, but none of the high men ever reached the age of Elros. And a\ngreat land was made for them; not a part of Middle-earth and not wholly\nseparate from it. This land was Númenor, and Elros was its first king.\nNúmenor was raised from the depths of the sea by Ossë, established by\nAulë and enriched by Yavanna. The Elves brought flowers and fountains\nout of Tol Eressëa from Avallónë and wrought gardens in Númenor. The\nValar called it Andor, The Land of Gift, and its own people called it\nWesternessë, for it lay west of all the lands inhabited by Mortals. When\nElros was 90 years old, he ascended the throne of Númenor in the city of\nArmenelos where he was inscribed as Elros Tar-Minyatur. The sword\nAranrúth which once was his great-great-grandfather Thingol's sword, the\nSerpent Ring, and Dramborleg, the Axe of Tuor became heirlooms of the\nKings of Númenor. During his time as king, Elros had four children to an\nunnamed mortal wife. They included three sons, Vardamir Nólimon,\nManwendil, and Atanalcar, and a daughter, Tindómiel.

Nonetheless, he ruled a diminished and dwindling\npeople; the wars of his youth had seen the Northern Dúnedain come close\nto destruction.

His lineage and influence\nleft him in a position to challenge the current king, Eldacar, who was\nonly half Dúnedain. As King Valacar's only son, Eldacar was the\nlegitimate heir to the throne, but his half Rhovanion lineage angered\ncitizens who believed in a pure dúnedain royalty. Capitalizing on what\nbecame outright protest against the current king, Castamir was able to\nincite rebellion and besiege Eldacar within the city Osgiliath in TA\n1437 of the Third Age. The city was set on fire by Castamir's troops,\ndestroying the famed Dome of Stars. Shortly thereafter, Eldacar fled the\ncity and into exile in Rhovanion, to the north. With the defeat of the\nking, Castamir seized the throne.\n\nFor ten years Castamir ruled Gondor with an iron fist, while Eldacar\nquietly regained power. Castamir ruled cruelly, and committed many foul\ndeeds, including executing Eldacar's own son, Ornendil. At first the\npeople of Gondor tolerated Castamir because of his pure Númenórean\nblood. Then, in 1447, Castamir, now called “the Usurper” by his people\nwas overthrown after a decade of wicked rule with the people now\nrallying around the true king, Eldacar. He was slain by Eldacar's forces\nat the Battle of Erui, the decisive battle of the Kin-strife as this\nperiod came to be known. At the Crossings of Erui, Eldacar personally\nslew Castamir.\n\nCastamir's influence did not end there. Remnants of his forces, and his\nsurviving sons, retreated from the Battle of Erui to the port of\nPelargir and escaped by ship to Umbar, far to the south. These\ndescendants of Castamir became the so-called “Corsairs of Umbar”, fierce\npirates who terrorized the ports of Gondor with the help of the men of\nHarad. They were perhaps the greatest threat to Gondor for nearly 400\nyears, commanding massive fleets of ships. Their most infamous exploit\nwas the Raid of Pelargir in TA 1634, in which a Corsair armada led by\nhis great-grandsons Angamaitë‎ and Sangahyando‎ sailed up the river\nAnduin to the port of Pelargir, deep in Gondor's territory. This raid\ncoincided with the young King Minardil's visit, and he was slain in by\nthe Corsairs as they attacked.\n\nThey remained a significant threat until TA 1810, when King Telumehtar\nretook Umbar for Gondor. So great a victory was this, that forever after\nTelumehtar was known as Umbardacil, which literally means “victor over\nUmbar”. In this battle the last descendants of Castamir were finally\nkilled.",

His wealth\nwas so great that historians remarked that _“precious stones are pebbles\nin Gondor for children to play with”_. He was also known as Atanatar\nAlcarin, “Atanatar the Glorious,” (_alcarin_ being the Quenya word for\n_glorious_), but the deeds of Atanatar weren't as glorious as his\nappellation would indicate.

    "text": "BEREN, also called BEREN ERCHAMION, was a man of Middle-earth, and a\nhero whose romance with the Elf Lúthien was one of the great stories of\nthe Elder Days that were told for many ages after he lived.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nEarly life in Dorthonion\n\nBeren was an Edain (a man), the son of Barahir and Emeldir the\nman-hearted. He was a man of the royal House of Bëor of Dorthonion, and\nthe most accomplished hero and adventurer of the First Age. The battle\nof the Dagor Bragollach befell during his youth, bringing about the ruin\nof his kingdom. The young Beren lived with his father and eleven loyal\nfollowers in the highlands of Dorthonion, and the thirteen of them\nperformed many acts of bravery, to the great frustration of Morgoth, the\nDark King of Angband. After the ruin of the Outlaws of Dorthonion and\nthe death of his father, Beren lived alone in Dorthonion off the land\nand came to know the many birds and beasts that lived there, and they\nhelped him when he needed it. During this time, he hunted nothing and\nate no meat and only killed the creatures of Morgoth that roamed the\ncountry. He learned not to fear death only captivity and bondage;\nhowever, things began to grow more difficult for him in Dorthonion for\nMorgoth put an even greater price on his head and he was forced from the\nland of his birth by Sauron and Draugluin. He crossed into Doriath,\nthrough the forests of Dungortheb, where he saw and fell in love with\nLúthien, princess of the Sindar and daughter of Thingol and Melian.\n\nThe Quest for the Silmaril\n\n Thingol\nhaughtily refused to give Lúthien's hand in marriage. He said that he\nwould allow the marriage to take place only if Beren brought back a\nSilmaril from the Iron Crown of Morgoth. The task was intended to be\nimpossible, but Beren and Lúthien, with the aid of Finrod of Nargothrond\nand Huan the Great Hound (both of whom died protecting Beren), braved\nmany perils (even besting Sauron, then Morgoth's most powerful\nlieutenant) and captured a Silmaril. However, as they escaped from\nAngband, the great wolf Carcharoth, whom Morgoth had personally bred,\nawoke. Beren held out the Silmaril, hoping that its radiance would avert\nthe beast, but he was mistaken. Carcharoth bit off his hand swallowed it\nand the Silmaril (thus Beren was called ERCHAMION, One-hand), and\nproceeded to run rampant through Doriath. Lúthien and the unconscious\nBeren were rescued by the Eagles of Manwë. When he presented himself to\nThingol, he demonstrated to him that he had obtained, then lost the\nSilmaril at the cost of one of his hands; he was then given the name\nCAMLOST, Empty-handed. Beren participated in the hunting of Carcharoth,\nwhere the beast was slain and the Silmaril recovered; the quest was\naccomplished, but in the process Beren was mortally wounded.\n\nSecond life\n\n\n\nLúthien's love for Beren was so strong that, upon hearing of his death,\nshe lay down and died. Her soul went to the Halls of Mandos, where she\nmanaged to charm Mandos into granting her a wish. Both she and Beren\nwere miraculously restored to life, but both of them would live as\nmortals and die the death of Men, and go beyond the walls of Arda to a\nplace unknown. Thus Beren and Lúthien lived again, and dwelt on Tol\nGalen in the middle of the river Adurant in Ossiriand. There they stayed\napart from other mortals; Beren was involved with the events of the\nFirst Age only one further time, when he waylaid a group of dwarves who\nhad destroyed Doriath and stolen the Nauglamír (and the Silmaril with\nit).\n\nLúthien bore Beren a son, named Dior, Thingol's heir, considered to be\none of the fairest beings to ever live, for in him flowed the blood of\nmen, of elves, and of the Ainur. Through his descendants, the blood of\nBeren and of Lúthien was preserved among the Eldar and the Edain.\n\nLegacy\n\nBeren's deeds inspired all the peoples opposing Morgoth to unite\nthemselves into a greater force to vanquish his power resulting in the\nvaliant but doomed Union of Maedhros. His romance and love for\nLúthien Tinúviel and what he was willing to do to ensure it helped\nfoster greater respect for men amongst the elves. He was also the first\nto mix the blood of elves and men with each other and this bloodline\ncontinued, siring the Númenórean nobility and the Dúnedain alike on\nup to Aragorn II Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Noldorin, the name _BEREN_ means “Bold”.\n\nHis epithets, _Erchamion_ (“one-handed”) and _Camlost_ (“empty-handed”),\nboth contain the Sindarin word _cam_ (“hand”).\n\n\nWeapons\n\nAs an outlaw in Dorthonion, Beren used Dagmor and a bow to aid him in\nhis journey. Later, he carried a knife called Angrist, which he used\nto cut the Silmaril from the Crown of Morgoth.\n\n\nInspiration and evolution of character\n\nThe story of Beren and Lúthien, though mentioned only briefly in _The\nLord of the Rings_, was a central part of the legendarium. Tolkien once\nreferred to it as “the kernel of the mythology” . He went on to say\nthat it \"arose from a small woodland glade filled with 'hemlocks', which\nhe visited while serving in the Humber Garrison in 1918 (during World\nWar I).\n\nTyr, a god of Norse Mythology, was a possible literary inspiration for\nBeren's loss of his hand to the wolf.\n\nWhen Tolkien died in 1973, he was buried in Wolvercote Cemetery (North\nOxford). The inscription on his gravestone reads:\n\n    JOHN RONALD REUEL TOLKIEN Beren 1892 - 1973\n\nThe name of _Lúthien_ also appears on the stone of his wife Edith:\n\n    EDITH MARY TOLKIEN Lúthien 1889 – 1971\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn the earliest version of the legendarium, Beren was going to be human,\nbut Tolkien erased over the original versions and wrote over much of the\ntext. The details of the original version of the story are little\nknown.\n\nIn the written draft, and published version Beren was changed to a GNOME\n(a Ñoldorin Elf), son of Egnor (which might have been an early name for\nAegnor). According to _Beren and Lúthien_ Egnor and Egnor (Aegnor)\nare two separate persons. It treats Barahir and Egnor bo-Rimion as two\nseparate persons (there is no explanation given, other than his father\nchanged concepts of Beren's race over time). But due to Christopher's\nplan to avoid too much editorial influence, he doesn't 'fix' or edit\nBeren's race to be consistent between different chapters of the story,\nbut retains whatever race his father had used at the time of wring each\nsection of the story for what he considers the 'continuous and\nstandalone story' derived from all the sources.\n\nSome of the artwork included in the book (all of which is drawn by Alan\nLee) seems to reflect Beren's interchanging Elven ancestry - in\nparticular the cover artwork, which appears to portray a scene from The\nTale of Tinúviel with Beren, Lúthien, and Huan.",

In human form, he appeared as a, tall, black-haired man with\nhuge arms and a great beard. Beorn kept many animals at his residence,\nsuch as horses, dogs and sheep. His animals were all extremely\nintelligent; his dogs, for instance, could walk on their hind legs while\ncarrying things with their forelegs, set the table, and able to speak.\nBeorn's horses could also understand what their master said. Beorn was\nalso capable of speaking in the tongue of beasts, as he could\ncommunicate with bears.

    "text": "ECTHELION, or ECTHELION OF THE FOUNTAIN, was a mighty lord of Gondolin\nduring the First Age of Middle-earth, and one of its greatest heroes.\nBiography Early life Most of Ecthelion's early life is unknown but he\nmight have lived in Aman in Tirion and might have been one of the\nfollowers of Fingolfin.He passed through the dangerous Helcaraxe and\nlived. After he survived the grinding ice, he settled in Vinyamar in\nNevrast before moving to Gondolin in FA 116. He later became lord of the\nhouse of the fountain. Aredhel's Escort Two hundred years after Gondolin\nwas wrought, Ecthelion, Glorfindel and Egalmoth, along with the White\nLady of the Ñoldor left the Hidden City due to Aredhel's yearning for\nthe freedom she once had in Valinor. Their orders were to lead her\ntowards Hithlum, where she would meet her elder brother Fingon. When\ncoming upon the Ford of Brithiach, Aredhel ordered them to turn south,\nfor she desired to see the Sons of Fëanor. Thus, Ecthelion and his\ncompanions sought admittance to Doriath, but the wardens refused them\nentrance inside the Girdle of Melian. Having no other choice, they took\nthe dangerous road between the haunted valleys of Ered Gorgoroth. Near\nNan Dungortheb, the Valley of Dreadful Death, the riders were caught in\na mesh of shadows and they were lost from Aredhel. In vain, they sought\nher afterwards, but the fell offspring of Ungoliant that dwelt in that\nplace pursued them. Barely escaping alive, the three lords returned to\nGondolin without the princess, where they were received in sorrow. A\nLord of Gondolin In the year, FA 473 Ecthelion fought alongside Turgon\nin the battle Nirnaeth Arnoediad, leading a wing of Gondolin's forces.\nUpon the defeat of the Ñoldor, he defended a flank as Turgon retreated.\nTwenty-three years after Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Tuor and Voronwë of\nGondolin traveled towards the Hidden City. After being led by Elemmakil\nthrough the Seven Gates, Ecthelion appeared before them as Warden of the\nGreat Gate. Ecthelion initially denied passage for Tuor but when Tuor\nmade a reference towards Ulmo, the Lord of the Waters, Ecthelion\neventually allowed him entry. He was the leader of the House of the\nFountain, one of the Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim. His people were\nfond of diamonds and silver, their array was most beautiful to the\nsight. In FA 510 during the Fall of Gondolin, Ecthelion led his house\ninto battle accompanied by the music of their flutes and great were the\ndamages caused to the enemy by their long, bright swords. Warcry of the\nEldar In the battle over Gondolin, Ecthelion and his forces made their\nentrance from the South part of the city, after previously being held in\nreserve. So terrible was his voice when commanding the drawing of the\nswords and the killings, which followed, that his name became a terror\namong the enemy and a Warcry to the Eldar. Valiantly fighting side by\nside with Tuor and his House of the Wing, they drove away the orcs until\nalmost the Gate was regained. As Dragons reinforced Morgoth's army,\nEcthelion killed three Balrogs and his sword did “hurt to their fire”.\nOutnumbered, they had to retreat. When doing so, Ecthelion's left arm\nwas wounded and his shield fell to earth. Tuor carried him away as they\njoined the remaining leaders in the Square of the King. In that place,\nthe great Fountain of the King stood and Ecthelion regained his strength\nby drinking from it. As seven dragons lead the enemy's forces towards\nthe Square, the remaining army of Gondolin began retreat. All but\nEcthelion, who remained near the fountain in a stand, which was\nremembered as the most valiant “in all the songs or in any tale”. It was\nthere that he faced Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs. Bane of Gothmog Tuor tried\nto stand in the way of Gothmog, but he was thrown aside. Then Ecthelion,\nfairest of the Ñoldor, but whose face now had the pallor of grey steel,\ndueled him. Losing his sword due to a wound received he was unable to\nprotect himself. Just as Gothmog was about to deliver the finishing\nblow, Ecthelion jumped and wrapped his legs around the demon, driving\nthe spike of his helmet into Gothmog's body. This caused Gothmog to lose\nhis balance, and he, along with Ecthelion, fell into the Fountain of the\nKing. Gothmog's fire was thus quenched, but Ecthelion also drowned with\nhim and found his death in cool waters, whose lord he was. Later, a\nyoung Eärendil asked about him, saying that he wished Ecthelion were\nthere, “to play to me on his flute, or make me willow whistles!\nPerchance has he gone on ahead?” After he was informed of Ecthelion's\ndeath, he “wept bitterly” and said that he cared no more to see the\nstreets of Gondolin. Weapons Although it was never confirmed, it is\nlargely believed that Ecthelion is the original owner of Orcrist. If so,\nit is interesting due to the fact that Orcrist and its mate Glamdring\nkilled the two most famous Balrogs of all time - Glamdring later killing\nDurin's Bane, and Orcrist Gothmog. If this is true, then it is also\ncurious that all combatants died during the Balrog battle. Etymology\nThere are three different sources that offer a translation of ECTHELION\nand they all differ substantially. - In _The Book of Lost Tales 2_\nAppendix, it is said that the name derives from the Quenya _ehtelë_\n(“issue of water, spring”), a reference to his title as Lord for the\nHouse of the Fountain. - In the etymologies of _The Lost Road and Other\nWritings_, his name is composed from _ehtë_, (“spear”) and _thela_,\n(“point”) (of spear). Put together they would translate as “Spear-point”\nor “Spear-head”. - In _The War of the Jewels_, which seems to be the\nlast matter J.R.R. Tolkien wrote on it, the name is derived from _aeg_,\n(“sharp”) and _thel_, (“intent, resolve”). This would translate “one of\nsharp resolve”. Other versions of the legendarium Perhaps the earliest\nJ.R.R. Tolkien writing, _The Fall of Gondolin_ was written during a\nleave of absence from the World War I, in the year 1916. It is in that\nstory, published posthumously by Christopher Tolkien in the volume _The\nBook of Lost Tales 2_ that Ecthelion first appears. Thus, he is one of\nthe first characters Tolkien ever created. However, from a chronological\npoint of view, the first account of his presence is the chapter _Of\nMaeglin_ from _The Silmarillion_. The events described here took place\nmore than one hundred and fifty years before those of Gondolin's fall.\nAlong with Glorfindel of Gondolin and Egalmoth, he was assigned by\nTurgon as Aredhel's escort on her ill-fated journey. Though no name is\nmentioned, only that “Turgon appointed three lords of his household”, an\nexplanatory note in the volume _The War of the Jewels_, chapter called\nMaeglin, sheds light on the escorts' identities.

He was probably born sometime during the Years of the\nTrees. Along with his father and brothers, he followed the Ñoldor into\nexile. His mother Nerdanel once asked Fëanor to leave Amrod and\nAmras, or at least one of them, but Fëanor did not listen. Nerdanel\nprophesied that not all his sons would set foot on Middle-earth.\n\nAt the dawn of the Burning of the ships at Losgar, Amras noticed the\nabsence of his twin brother Amrod. He explained that Amrod was restless\nand did not sleep on the ground out of discomfort. He was the last to\nspeak about this matter to Fëanor.\n\nLater, Amras and his brothers rescued their father who died afterward\nfrom Dagor-nuin-Giliath. He became a hunter in Middle-earth and held\nthe southern lands of Estolad in the East Beleriand between the rivers\nGelion, Celon, and the Andram behind the March of Maedhros.\n\nAmras took part in the final two Kinslayings, and eventually fell during\nthe Third Kinslaying at the Havens of Sirion in FA 538.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_AMRAS_ is a Sindarin word.

His life as Lord of Andúnie and as\none of the Faithful sired the High Kings of Gondor and Arnor who\npreserved their ways through the Dúnedain of Middle-earth on up to\nAragorn II Elessar. Elendil the Tall was his son.\n\n\nBiography\n\nIn the youth of Amandil he had great friendship with Pharazôn who had\nkinship with him through his father's mother Inzilbêth.\n\nWhen Pharazôn married Tar-Míriel and he took the Scepter of Númenor he\nbecame corrupted by his father's counsel and Pharazôn and Amandil became\nestranged. Amandil, who was the leader of the Faithful in Númenor though\nnot openly, supported the ban of the Valar and for the old traditions\nwhereas Pharazôn followed the counsel of his father and that of his own\nwill. Pharazôn deprived the Lords of Andúnië of their lordship due to\ntheir support of the old King Tar-Palantir and he commanded Amandil to\ndwell in Rómenna. Andúnië he took and made it to his chief harbour of\nhis ships but he did not dismiss him from his council or in any other\nway molest him.\n\nIn SA 3261 Pharazôn brought Sauron to Númenor and over the years he was\nbeing convinced by the lies of Sauron.\n\nSensing the impending doom of Númenor, he urged his son Elendil not to\ninterfere in the upcoming war, but to expect, and prepare for, a forced\ndeparture from the island. He himself decided to set sail for Valinor,\nthere to plead with the Valar for forgiveness and mercy for the\nNúmenórean people, since at least a few had remained faithful.\n\nHe departed into the West either SA 3310 and SA 3316, just before\nthe Great Armament was ready to launch in an attempt to reach Valinor\nand save Númenor. He set sail in a small ship with three servants dear\nto him (though no names are given for them) at night from Rómenna\nsteering East, like it was his goal to reach Middle-earth, but soon he\nturned and journeyed into the West. He never returned, and was never\nheard from again.\n\nWhether Amandil's voyage was successful is unknown, but soon after the\ndestruction of Númenor, a great wave carried Elendil's ships safely to\nMiddle-earth, suggesting that his pleas were indeed heard.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_AMANDIL_'s name means “Lover of Aman” or perhaps “Devoted to Aman” in\nQuenya.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn Tolkien's unfinished time-travel story “The Lost Road” Amandil has\nthe name Valandil “friend of Gods”, which for a high Court official in\nthe later days of Pharazon was doubtless a bad idea. It is likely that\nTolkien (though this is nowhere stated) intended Valandil to have\ndiscreetly changed his name to Amandil, still thus keeping his loyalty\nknown but not so bluntly as Valandil would have done.\n\nAs Tolkien, had he finished it, was intending to work in the Seven\nSleepers legend, Amandil and his three servants may well have been\ncandidates for the Seven.",

    "text": "AMROTH was an Elven king of Lothlórien.\n\nAlthough he was descended from the Sindarin Elves, Amroth was pleased to\nadopt the customs of the Galadhrim and to live in a high house on Cerin\nAmroth, a hill in Lothlórien.\n\n\nBiography\n\nThird Age\n\nWhen Amroth's father, Amdír, was killed during the Battle of Dagorlad in\nSA 3434, Amroth became the King of Lothlórien. He became the last of the\nruling Sindar over Lorien.\n\nAmroth and Nimrodel\n\nAmroth's beloved, a beautiful Elf Maiden named Nimrodel, regretted that\nElves from Beleriand, which was under assault by Morgoth, were being\nadmitted into Lothlórien. She believed that these foreign Elves brought\nwars and destroyed the peace that Lothlórien's inhabitants had once\nenjoyed. When a Balrog was awakened in Moria by the delvings of the\nDwarves and they fled north to the Grey Mountains, many of the Elves\nliving on the west side of Lórien moved inward, and the Galadhremmin\ntightened their guard. Nimrodel, living on the west side of the forest\nby the stream that afterward bore her name, preferring not to mix with\nthe Galadhremmin who she deemed invaders of the golden wood, instead\nfled to Fangorn Forest in TA 1981 (Third Age). Amroth followed her to\nthe forest, which was much closer to Lothlórien than it later became.\nUpon attempting to enter the forest, Nimrodel was halted and badly\nfrightened by the movements and murmurings of the Black Huorns who\nbarred her entrance. She lingered on the edge of the forest, unsure of\nwhat to do. Amroth found her there a day later.\n\nThere, Amroth and Nimrodel spoke long and earnestly with one another,\nAmroth begging for her favor. Eventually, the Elf-Maiden promised that\nshe would marry Amroth only if he brought her to a peaceful land.\n\nAmroth vowed that he would leave the Elves of Lothlórien, even if a time\ncame when they needed him most. However, none of Middle-earth was at\npeace and Amroth believed that the Elves would never enjoy peace again.\nHe suggested that he and Nimrodel should travel across the Sundering\nSeas to the Undying Lands.\n\nAmroth knew that the Sindarin Elves had come to the Bay of Belfalas, a\nhaven south of Lothlórien, long ago. Although the majority of those\nelves had left Middle-earth and sailed to the Undying Lands, Amroth was\naware that some of their kind still built ships and offered passage to\nany of the other elves wishing to leave Middle-earth. After Amroth made\nthe necessary arrangements, he and Nimrodel left Lothlórien.\n\nHowever, they somehow became separated on their journey. Amroth looked\nfor Nimrodel, but his search was unsuccessful so he continued south\ntowards the Sundering Seas.\n\nFate\n\nAt the havens on the Bay of Belfalas, Amroth found that the few\nremaining Sindarin Elves who remained in Middle-earth were preparing to\nleave aboard the only seaworthy ship that they had. Although they\nwelcomed Amroth aboard, they were unwilling to wait for Nimrodel. They\nhoped that she was in Gondor and that she had not attempted to cross the\nWhite Mountains, where many unfriendly Men and evil creatures lived.\n\nThe summer was almost over and it would soon be autumn, which was\nexpected to bring dangerously strong winds. However, the Elves saw that\nAmroth was extremely upset. They had removed all their possessions from\ntheir houses on the shore, so they waited with Amroth on their ship for\nmany weeks. Summer passed and autumn came, but Nimrodel still did not\narrive.\n\nOne night, one of the fiercest storms in the recorded history of Gondor\ncame from the Northern Wastes, swept through Eriador and caused an\nenormous amount of destruction to Gondor. Many of the ships that the Men\nof Gondor had built were swept away from the coast and sank. The wind\nbroke the light Elven-ship from its moorings and hurled the vessel far\nfrom the Bay of Belfalas, driving it towards the coasts of Umbar.\n\nAt dawn of the following morning, the storm dissipated. However, when\nAmroth awoke, he saw that the ship was already far from its port. Full\nof despair, Amroth screamed Nimrodel's name, threw himself into the\nwater below and drowned.\n\nThe ship was never seen again in Middle-earth, although it is likely\nthat the vessel left the Circles of the World and eventually reached Tol\nEressëa, an island that the Eldar used to enable them to complete the\nGreat Journey.\n\nNeither Elves nor Men ever saw Amroth or Nimrodel again, but there were\nmany legends concerning Nimrodel's fate.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe Elf Maiden shared her name with a stream where she once lived, which\nindirectly flowed into the Bay of Belfalas. According to Elven legend,\nAmroth's voice continued to emanate from the sea and Nimrodel's voice\noften resonated from the stream that shared her name.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Amroth_ means “upclimber” or “high climber”, from _am_ (“high, going\nup”). It refers to his having built and dwelt in a flet high in the\ntrees on Cerin Amroth. The name was of Lemberin language (later\n“Avarin”), along with other Sindarin names such as _Legolas_,\n_Nimrodel_, and _Thranduil_.\n\n\nAmroth in Song\n\nLegolas sang an extract from a long and sad song to Frodo Baggins by the\nbanks of the Nimrodel. The song, which depicted the story of Amroth and\nNimrodel, was sometimes sung in Rivendell.\n\n An Elven-maid there was of old, A shining star by day: Her mantle white\nwas hemmed with gold, Her shoes of silver-grey.\n\nA star was bound upon her brows, A light was on her hair As sun upon the\ngolden boughs In Lórien the fair.\n\nHer hair was long, her limbs were white, And fair she was and free; And\nin the wind she went as light As leaf of linden-tree.\n\nBeside the falls of Nimrodel, By water clear and cool, Her voice as\nfalling silver fell Into the shining pool.\n\nWhere now she wanders none can tell, In sunlight or in shade; For lost\nof yore was Nimrodel And in the mountains strayed.\n\nThe elven-ship in haven grey Beneath the mountain-lee Awaited her for\nmany a day Beside the roaring sea.\n\nA wind by night in Northern lands Arose, and loud it cried, And drove\nthe ship from elven-strands Across the streaming tide.\n\nWhen dawn came dim the land was lost, The mountains sinking grey Beyond\nthe heaving waves that tossed Their plumes of blinding spray.\n\nAmroth beheld the fading shore Now low beyond the swell, And cursed the\nfaithless ship that bore Him far from Nimrodel.\n\nOf old he was an Elven-king, A lord of tree and glen, When golden were\nthe boughs in spring In fair Lothlórien.\n\nFrom helm to sea they saw him leap, As arrow from the string, And dive\ninto the water deep, As mew upon the wing.\n\nThe wind was in his flowing hair, The foam about him shone; Afar they\nsaw him strong and fair Go riding like a swan.\n\nBut from the West has come no word, And on the Hither Shore No tidings\nElven-folk have heard Of Amroth evermore.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nAmroth was briefly the son of Galadriel and Celeborn, brother of\nCelebrían. In this version, he lived in Eregion and fled with Galadriel\nand Celebrían between TA 1350 and TA 1400.\n\nHe was called as Ammalas in earlier writings, and was the lover of\nInglorel (Nimrodel).",

    "text": "MANWË (Quenya; IPA: - “Blessed One”) was the leader of the Ainur, one of\nthe Aratar, King of the Valar, husband of Varda, brother of the Dark\nLord Melkor, and King of Arda. He was also known as SÚLIMO, _'Mânawenûz\nOR Valahiru _'and lives atop Mount Taniquetil in Valinor, the highest\nmountain of the world. The winds and airs are his servants. He was the\ngreatest in authority, but not in power, of all the Valar, Melkor being\nmore powerful. He was however the greatest of the Aratar, among whom\nMelkor was not counted. Biography Manwë was (with Melkor) the eldest of\nthe Ainur, and the one that best understood the will of Eru. When Melkor\ncreated the discord in the Music of the Ainur, the Second Theme of Eru\nthat rose to counter the discord used Manwë as its chief instrument.\nWhen Arda was formed, Manwë was appointed Ruler of Arda, hence his most\ncommon title, the Elder King. Manwë was a kind, compassionate ruler,\nunconcerned with his own power. He oversaw all of the Valar's early\nattempts to order Arda, but was unable to stop Melkor's rampages until\nthe Vala Tulkas came to Arda to assist his brethren. Afterwards, the\nValar under Manwë made an abode on Middle-earth in the Isle of Almaren\nand constructed the two Lamps of the Valar to provide light to the\nworld. But Melkor destroyed the lamps, and the Valar retreated to the\ncontinent of Aman, which they heavily fortified. Eventually, the Elves\nawoke in Middle-earth, and Manwë at last went with the other Valar to\nsubdue Melkor. They succeeded, and Melkor was imprisoned in the Halls of\nMandos. He extended an invitation to the Elves to journey to Aman and\nlive there amongst the Valar. For the three Ages of Melkor's\nimprisonment, the Valar and the Elves lived in peace and happiness. But\neventually Melkor was allowed to plead for pardon before Manwë again. As\nManwë was completely free of evil, he was unable to comprehend it,\nleading him to believe Melkor's lies concerning his reformation. He\nreleased Melkor from Mandos, whereupon Melkor began plotting the\ndownfall of the Elves and the ruin of Aman's bliss. He began to cleverly\nspread lies amongst the Ñoldor, who soon grew to resent the Valar\nbecause of said lies. Eventually, due to the rebellious actions of the\nNoldor prince Fëanor, Melkor's lies were uncovered, but he escaped\nbefore he could be recaptured. Soon thereafter, Melkor recruited the\ngreat spider Ungoliant and poisoned the Two Trees. He then murdered the\nKing of the Noldor, Finwë, stole the Silmarils, and incited Fëanor's\nleaving Aman with most of the Noldor in rebellion. Soon thereafter,\nManwë learned that the rebellious Noldor had attacked and slaughtered\nmany of the Teleri. As such, he forbade the Ñoldor from returning to\nValinor once they left, and stated also that the Elves would receive no\nhelp from the Valar in their war against Morgoth. He then caused Valinor\nto be hidden by way of the Shadowy Seas and the Enchanted Isles to\nprevent the Ñoldor from returning. To hearten the Eldar, he had Aulë\nfashion the Sun and the Moon, for he knew the rising of the Atani was\ncoming soon, and sent Thorondor and the Eagles to watch them. After\nMorgoth's fall, Manwë cast him into the void. Manwë dresses in blue\nrobes and has blue eyes. He wields a scepter of sapphire made for him by\nthe Ñoldor. The Vanyar are his favorite Elves, and they live with him\nand Varda on Mount Taniquetil. Maiar of Manwë - Eönwë, Manwë's\nbanner-bearer and herald. In earlier conceptions of the legendarium,\nEönwë, then called FIONWË ÚRION, was envisioned as the son of Manwë and\nbrother of Erinti, renamed as Ilmarë, Varda's handmaiden. - In some\nversions, FIONWË, later named Eönwë, is the one who will kill Morgoth\nfor his love for Urwendi (Later named Arien). - Olórin (Gandalf), the\nsecond-in-command (and later leader) of the wizards sent to Middle-earth\nto fight against Sauron, and Manwë comforted him when Olórin showed\nuneasiness and fear of Sauron's powers. Etymology The name _MANWË_ means\n“blessed one” or “blessed person”, from the Quenya _man_ (“blessed”) and\n_wë_ (“person”). SÚLIMO literally means “the Breather”, from the Quenya\n_súlimë_ (“wind”) and Sindarin _sûl_ (“wind”). His Sindarin name is ARAN\nEINIOR, the “Elder King”.

He and his folk were the first of\nMankind to encounter the Ñoldor of Beleriand when King Finrod Felagund\nhappened upon their camp in Ossiriand in the year FA 310. After years of\nwandering westwards in search of the High Elves (or the Valar, of whom\nthe Bëorians had heard rumor from the lesser elves they had met in the\neast), Bëor was eager to establish good relations with Felagund, and the\ntwo strove to understand each other. The language barrier was not a\nmajor problem due to the similarities between the tongue of the\nBëorians, which had been influenced by the elves they had met earlier,\nand the Sindarin tongue. In the tongue of his people, called Taliska,\nBëor was named 'Balan'. The name he is more commonly called by, Bëor was\nactually the Taliska word for 'vassal', which he earned in the service\nof Felagund.\n\n\n\nBëor and his people settled first in Ossiriand, but were at odds with\nthe Green-elves that already dwelt there, for the men competed with the\nelves for food and natural resources. Therefore, on the advice of\nFelagund, Bëor led his people to Estolad, the encampment, in the realm\nof Amrod and Amras, sons of Fëanor. There the people of the first house\nbecame more numerous and were enriched by the teachings of the Eldar.\nBëor, however, was not content and wanted to leave Estolad and enter\ninstead into the service of King Felagund. He committed the rule of his\npeople to Baran, his son, and departed with Felagund to his realm of\nNargothrond. There Bëor continued his service with Felagund, and he\nreturned never to Estolad. He died in the year 355 of the First Age at\nthe age ninety-three, having spent 44 years in the service of Felagund.\nHis death was greatly lamented by King Finrod and his people, who\nwitnessed for the first time the Gift of Men: death. But in the end Bëor\ngave up his life willingly and died in peace, a thing previously unheard\nof by the elves, who wondered much at the strange lives of men.\n\nBëor was held among the Wise of the Edain, and was revered by many among\nthe Eldar.

She was notable for her speed, being fast “as\nan arrow in movement”, for which reason she was called _NESSA THE\nSWIFT_. Biography Nessa was the sister of Oromë. She was lithe and swift\nof foot and Nessa loved fast moving creatures such as deer. And the deer\nfollowed her train wherever she went even into the wild regions of Aman.\nNessa could outrun the deer with great speed with the wind in her hair.\nNessa married Tulkas aka _TULKAS THE STRONG_, during the Spring of Arda.\nBefore the destruction of the _Isle of Almaren_, the first dwelling of\nthe Valar, Nessa delighted in dancing and would often dance on the great\ngreen grass of Almaren; and later, in Valinor on never-fading green\nlawns. Henceforth, as the Valar had finished with their labours in the\ncreation of Arda, King Manwë ordained a great feast on Almaren. So the\nValar were gathered upon Almaren during the _Spring of Arda_; and it was\nsung that on this great feast, Nessa wedded Tulkas there at that time\nwhere Nessa's sister-in-law, _Vána the Ever-young_,'' ''wife of Oromë,\nrobed Nessa with her flowers. Thereon, Nessa danced before the Valar\nupon the green grass of Almaren. The dwelling of Nessa and Tulkas was\nsaid to be a house full of mirth and revelry. For in the House of\nTulkas, his warriors played and rivaled one another there in doughty\nfeats. At times, Nessa would bear goblets of wine and cooling drinks\namong the champions of her husband. After the flight of the Ñoldor to\nMiddle-earth, like most of the Valar, Nessa also desired ease and peace\njust like the ancient days of Valinor. Wishing not for the rumour of\nMelkor nor for the murmurs of the Ñoldor to come ever again among them\nand disturb their happiness. As a result for such reasons, most of the\nValar clamored for the concealment of their land. Hence, the Hiding of\nValinor took place. Etymology NESSA comes from the Quenya _neth_\n(“young”). Other names Two earlier names for Nessa were HELINYETILLE,\nthe “Eyes of Heartsease”, from _helin_ (“violet, pansy”), and MELESTA,\nfrom _mele_ (“to love”). Character Nessa loved most to retire to the\nfair ever-green lawns of Valinor which Oromë had cultivated from the\nrichness of all his forest glades. For it was told that, when Yavanna\n(_Queen of the Earth_) created the forests of Oromë, she had planted\nthere these forest glades with spells so that these glades would always\nremain green and smooth. There in the fair lawns of Valinor, Nessa along\nwith her maidens would dance as long as the great golden Tree Laurelin''\n_was in bloom._'' It was told that she herself was a greater dancer than\nVána, for Nessa was not just known for her notable speed but for her\ndancing abilities as well. Other Versions in the Legendarium In the\nearlier texts, Nessa and Estë were considered “highest among the Maiar”.\nLea the Young was the wife of Tulkas, and was later changed to Nessa.\nNessa was once envisioned as the daughter of Vána.

Biography Before she came to\nMiddle-earth, Melian served both Vána and Estë, and dwelt in Lórien\ntending the trees that grew in the Gardens of Irmo. Among all of her\npeople none were wiser, (With the possible exception of Gandalf) more\nbeautiful, or more skilled in singing enchanting songs than Melian. She\nloved the deep shadows of the great trees. When the light of the Two\nTrees would mingle Melian would sing and the Valar would stop their work\nand listen. Nightingales went with her wherever she went, and she taught\nthem their song. Of all the Valar she was most akin to Yavanna. When the\nElves awoke on the shore of Cuiviénen she departed from Valinor and went\nto Middle-earth, where she filled its silence with her singing and the\nsinging of her birds. While in the forest of Nan Elmoth she met and fell\nin love with the Elven-king Elu Thingol, and later she ruled the kingdom\nof Doriath by his side. For thousands of years, she used her powers to\nguard and defend the city with a protection spell called the _Girdle of\nMelian_, but she predicted that one person would one day breach this\ndefense. The Girdle functioned to bewilder any who attempted to enter\nDoriath, and was so potent that even Ungoliant was unable to bypass it.\nShe and her husband had a child, a daughter named Lúthien. During her\nstay in Doriath she became a friend and mentor of Galadriel. Melian\nwanted to know the cause of the exile of the Ñoldor. Galadriel only\nbriefly narrated the story to her, leaving out the death of Finwë, the\nKinslaying at Alqualondë, and the burning of the ships at Losgar. But\neventually she and Thingol learned the truth. Melian's main line of\ndescent is of the Half-elven, and through her daughter the Maian blood\npassed to both Elves and Men. When Beren arrived as foretold, she\ncounseled Thingol against sending Beren for a Silmaril, a quest which\nwould eventually lead to Doriath's ruin. A friend of Mankind, she also\naided Húrin's family by hosting Túrin in Doriath and later helped Beleg\nCúthalion in his search for Túrin by giving him Lembas. When Húrin came\nto Doriath old and carrying a great grief and misery on him, Melian\nhelped him see through his ills. After Thingol's death she left Doriath,\nvisiting Beren and Lúthien for a time warning them of the Dwarves\ntreachery, and the curse on the Mîm's treasure. Shortly there-after, she\nwent back to Valinor, musing upon her sorrows in the gardens of Lorien\nwhence she came.

He was also the fourth Lord of Ladros and the seventh and\nprobably last Chieftain of the Bëorians after his deceased elder brother\nBregolas. Besides his elder brother, Barahir had three elder\nsisters: _Bregil_, _Hirwen_, and _Gilwen_.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarlier, Barahir had fought at the Dagor Bragollach, saving Finrod\nFelagund's life earning him and his house the friendship of the House of\nFinarfin. For this, he received “Barahir's Ring”, which was then handed\ndown the family line. After the Dagor Bragollach by FA 456, Barahir\nlived with twelve companions on the highland of Dorthonion at Tarn\nAeluin as outlaws defying the will of Morgoth whose forces hunted him\nand his company like wild beasts. The members of Barahir's outlaw\nband was his son Beren, his nephews Baragund the elder and Belegund the\nyounger, Radhruin and Dairuin, Dagnir and Ragnor, Gildor and Gorlim _the\nUnhappy_, Arthad, and Urthel, and Hathaldir _the Young_. As for his wife\nEmeldir, she parted from Barahir when she became the leader of the women\nand children of Bëor's folk that fled Dorthonion. For her bravery in\nthis, Barahir's wife was known as _Emeldir the Man-hearted_,\n\nFor five years, Barahir led his doomed band of outlaws until FA 460 when\nthey were betrayed to Sauron by Gorlim, a lovesick member of Barahir's\noutlaw band and Barahir was killed at Tarn Aeluin along with everyone in\nhis company save for Beren his son who was gone on an errand for them\nand thus luckily happened to be not there. Barahir's remains were buried\nin a cairn by his son at Tarn Aeluin save for his hand which was chopped\noff by an Orc captain of Morgoth. Beren later slew that Orc-captain and\nrecovered the renowned Ring of Barahir. Barahir's son then escaped\nDorthonion after all and lived on to fulfill a great destiny.\n\nLegacy\n\nBarahir's service to Finrod and House of Finarfin left behind a legacy\nof respect between the House of Bëor, later generations of Men, and\nElves. This friendship led to the close association of the elves and the\nDúnedain of Númenor and Arnor and Gondor. His ring also became an\nheirloom of the Dúnedain of the North of Middle-earth.\n\n\nLater namesakes\n\nBarahir was also the name of the eighth Steward of Gondor and was also\nthe name of the grandson of Faramir and Éowyn in the Fourth Age, who\nwrote _The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen_.\n\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nThe character of Barahir evolved out of the character Egnor bo-Rimion\n(see _The Book of Lost Tales_ and _Beren and Lúthien_ novel). In the\noriginal Barahir was originally a Gnome, an Elf. The Tale of Tinúviel\nsaw a 1925 (and later) edit that changed Egnor into Barahir a Noldoli\nElf. At some point the character evolved into a Man. However, its noted\nin _'Beren and Luthien_ that the in the original pre-1917 transcript\nwhich J.R.R. Tolkien erased and wrote over that Beren was originally a\nMan, before he rewrote the character as an Elf, and would go back to\nmaking him a Man in _Lay of Leithian_ (though the narrative included in\nthe new novel has Beren switching between both races depending on the\nsection documents).",

In this version, Amrod and his six\nbrothers rescued their father during the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. He had\nalso held the lands of Estolad with his brother. In FA 583, Amrod and\nAmras died during the Third Kinslaying at the Havens of Sirion.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_AMROD_s father-name is TELUFINWË “Last Finwë”, most likely from the\nQuenyan _tella_ (“hindmost, last”). The short form of this name is\nTELVO. Originally, his mother-name was AMBARUSSA “Top-russet”, from\n_amba_ (“upwards”).

Then in great dread,\nFëanor perceived that his son Amrod had wished to sail back and rejoin\nhis mother Nerdanel in Valinor but the ships had all been burnt now with\nhis son in one of them. Thus sadly, Amrod perished there in Losgar when\nthe ships had been set to fire by the command of his father.

Most of the\nsurviving people, including Aranarth, fled to Lindon, but King Arvedui\nwent north to the Ice-Bay of Forochel.

He then saw the bravery and valour of Men, and\noffered the Haladin settlement in the North, but Haleth, thanking him,\nrefused and left, eventually settling in the Brethil.\n\nIn FA 455, after the Dagor Bragollach, Caranthir was forced to flee\nThargelion and headed south with his brother Amrod. Two years later, the\nsons of Ulfang, Uldor, Ulfast and Ulwarth swore allegiance to\nCaranthir but were faithless later in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.\n\nCaranthir, along with his brothers Celegorm and Curufin, perished during\nthe Second Kinslaying in Menegroth to recover the Silmarils from Elven\nKing Dior of Doriath.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nCARANTHIR is the Sindarin translation of his mother-name CARNISTIR\n(“Red-face”) from the Quenya _carnë_ (“red, scarlet”). His\nfather-name is MORIFINWË (“Dark Finwë”) from _mor_ (“Dark”).\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn the earlier versions, Caranthir was called '''Cranthor ''' and\nCRANTHIR.",

It is not certain whether Iorlas was the\nbrother of Beregond or of Bergil's mother, although Iorlas does not\nfollow the alliterative pattern evident in males known to be related to\nBeregond (_Bergil, Borlas_).\n\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in TA 3009, Bergil was nine years old at the time when the War of\nthe Ring began. He is one of the few children that remained in Minas\nTirith during that when the forces of Mordor were preparing to lay siege\non the city. He guides Peregrin Took throughout the city when he and\nGandalf arrived, and they became very good friends in the process.\nBefore the armies of Mordor were about to lay siege, Bergil and Pippin\nwitnessed the arrival of several armies from other parts of Gondor to\ndefend the city. During the siege of Minas Tirith, Bergil helped the\nhealers of the city as an errand runner and so eventually contributed to\nthe healing of Faramir, the Steward's son and later Prince of Ithilien.\n\nBergil who, running errands for the healers of Minas Tirith, told\nGandalf where Pippin and the injured Meriadoc Brandybuck were; Merry,\nsuffering from the Black Breath, had gotten lost during the battle over\nthe fields of Pelennor. He was also the one who brought the Athelas\nleaves to Aragorn; at that time, he showed his love for Faramir by\nbursting into tears. Bergil also kept Merry company while the Captains\nof the West led their men off to the Black Gate and then escorted him\nback to the Houses of Healing.\n\nOf Bergil's destiny the novel or its appendices tell nothing.

    "text": "FREDEGAR “FATTY” BOLGER was one of the small group of Hobbits who knew\nthat Frodo had the Ring. Fatty was a descendant of Hildibrand Took (TA\n2849 - TA 2934), one of the many sons of the Gerontius Took. He was the\nson of Odovacar Bolger and Rosamunda Took. Fatty was born in TA 2980.\n\nHe had a younger sister, ESTELLA (TA 2985 - ?), who married Meriadoc\nBrandybuck.\n\n\nHistory\n\n Fatty, along with Folco Boffin, Sam, Merry\nand Pippin is one of Frodo Baggins's friends, and helped move his things\nfrom Bag End to his new home at Crickhollow. There, he and Merry welcome\nFrodo, Sam and Pippin when those three arrive from Bucklebury.\n\nWhen Frodo and the rest set out to take the Ring to Rivendell, Fredegar\nstayed behind at Crickhollow in an attempt to keep up appearances and\ndelay news of their departure. He was frightened half out of his wits by\nthe arrival of the Nazgûl but escaped unharmed. Fredegar could have gone\nwith Frodo and his companions into the Old Forest, but was terrified of\nthe stories about it. Though Merry tried to persuade him that the Old\nForest would be nothing compared to meeting the Ringwraiths, Fatty was\nadamant, so the other Hobbits went into the forest with only the\nknowledge of Merry to aid them. Soon while Frodo and his other friends\nleft Fatty stayed to make Frodo seem like he hadn't left. Then on\nSeptember the 30th Fredegard was attacked by Nazgûl and ran to the\nnearest house and raised the Horn-call of Buckland and so the Nazgûl\nleft.\n\nDuring Saruman's rule of the Shire he led a group of partisans fighting\nagainst the Ruffians around the Hills of Scary, before eventually being\ncaptured. He and his sons were imprisoned in the Lockholes and starved,\nmeaning that after his release nobody could call him Fatty any more.\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nIn earlier drafts of _The Lord of the Rings_ Fatty Bolger played a much\nlarger role, but this was later abandoned. His role survives as a minor\nanomaly in the book — before the Hobbits go into the Old Forest, they\nhave five ponies prepared — but only take four. Bolger was originally\nsupposed to go with them.\n\nIt might be argued that Fredegar Bolger is the least heralded but\nperhaps the most significant of all the heroes of the War of the Rings:\nby delaying the Nazgul just slightly, he may well have turned the whole\ncourse of the War in favor of the West away from Sauron.... and for his\nheroism is starved in the Lockholes.\n\n\n\nSMALL APPEARANCE IN THE MOVIE\n\nIn the extended edition of the Fellowship of the Ring, there is a brief\nclip of Bilbo greeting Fatty Bolger, however, they do not show his face,\nand the clip is very brief. Some minutes later he appears again,\ncheering as Bilbo shouts his name. Though it is not confirmed that the\nhobbit cheering was Fatty, it is likely, as his appearance is very\nsimilar to that of the Fatty Bolger Bilbo greeted.",

Aredhel was the sister of\nFingon, Turgon and Argon, and the mother of Maeglin.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nAredhel was born in YT 1362, the same year as her cousin Galadriel,\nand lived in Tirion. She followed her father and brothers through\nHelcaraxë and dwelt in Nevrast with her brother Turgon until Gondolin\nwas complete, and when it was she went with him to the hidden city. But\nafter two hundred years, the longing for the forests and wide lands\novercame her, and she asked leave to depart. Turgon was unwilling,\nfearing the exposure of the Hidden Kingdom, but eventually relented and\nallowed her to leave.\n\nRiding with companions Glorfindel, Ecthelion, and Egalmoth, they were\ndenied entrance to Doriath, it being closed to the Ñoldor. But they did\ntell her of the best way to find the Sons of Fëanor, and so they went\naround to the north, where she was separated in the dangerous region of\nNan Dungortheb and reported lost. However, she reached Himlad safely,\nand waited there to meet Celegorm who was abroad, but eventually she\nwandered out of boredom and became lost in the forest of Nan Elmoth.\n\n\n\nEöl the Dark Elf ruled those woods; seeing Aredhel and noticing her\nbeauty, he set enchantments about her so that she could not escape the\nforest. Eventually, she wandered to Eöl's dwelling in the woods, where\nhe finally revealed himself to her. After marrying him, she stayed with\nhim many years. They had a son named Maeglin, and telling him of her\nformer life and home, she desired to see them again, and left Nan Elmoth\nwith Maeglin while Eöl was away. They reached Gondolin (not realizing\nthat Eöl was following them all the while), and were received with\nrejoicing. Eöl was also discovered and brought before Turgon, but rather\nthan accept Turgon's judgment to remain, he attempted to kill his son\nfor disobeying him with a poisoned javelin concealed in his cloak.\nAredhel stepped in front of it and was hit by it and because of its\npoison, she died that night from the wound.\n\nEöl was cast down from the city walls and died, while Maeglin became\nmighty in Gondolin but later betrayed it to Morgoth.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHer name in Quenya was IRISSË. The names AREDHEL (“noble elf”) and\nAR-FEINIEL (“noble white lady”) were both originally intended to stand\nalone, and be used as the main name of Irissë.\n\nWhile preparing _The Silmarillion_ for publication Christopher Tolkien\ncould not discover which name was intended to be used as her final name,\nand he therefore chose to use both names: a decision he later stated in\n_The History of Middle-earth_ series was possibly mistaken.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nAredhel was tall and strong, fond of hunting and riding in the forests.\nHer skin was pale and her hair dark; she always wore silver and white.\nThough fond of the Sons of Fëanor, she never fell in love with any of\nthem.\n\n\nGallery",

Later Túrin spared Andróg despite his participating\nin Forweg's attempt to trap Larnach's daughter, and Andróg supported him\nin becoming the leader of the band. After Beleg was captured by the\noutlaws, Andróg egged them to kill him, coveting Beleg's bow\nBelthronding, and he showed no favour to the Elf even after his release\nby Túrin.\n\nAndróg was the foremost in the attempt to capture the Petty-dwarves,\nseizing Mîm and shooting arrows at his sons. Once again, he wished to\nslay Mîm immediately, despising all dwarves, and misdoubted his gift of\nAmon Rûdh. Andróg was cursed by Mîm when it became known that his arrow\nslew Khîm:\n\nAndróg obeyed, fearing the Dwarf's curse, but prophecised in reply that\nMîm will “lack a bow at need ere his end”. Some time afterwards\nAndróg took up bow and arrows again, and was wounded by a poisoned\nshaft. He was healed by Beleg at Túrin's bidding, but continued to\nmistrust the Elf; Mîm's curse, however, was not put to rest thus. In\nfact this act made Mîm even more angry, because all Petty-dwarves hate\nElves with a passion.\n\nDuring the Sack of Amon Rûdh Andróg lead some of the band to the top of\nthe hill by a secret stair that he discovered some time before. There he\nfought more valiantly than any, but fell mortally wounded by an arrow.\nHis son Andvír, however, survived the battle.",

So Carcharoth, who was also named ANFAUGLIR (IPA:\n/anˈfaʊglir/), the 'Jaws of Thirst', grew to great size and his strength\nseemed beyond compare. His eyes burned like red coals and his teeth were\npoisoned as the spears of the Orcish legions. Carcharoth was the\nguardian of the gate of Angband and none could pass him by strength of\nbody alone. He became involved with the Quest for the Silmaril when\nBeren and Lúthien had to pass him on their way in. He espied them on\ntheir way in, and grew suspicious of Beren because he was disguised as\nDraugluin, who Carcharoth knew to be slain. Before he could take action\nagainst the pair, Lúthien enchanted him with her magic, sending him into\na deep sleep. Unfortunately, on their way out Carcharoth awoke, and\nLúthien was too weary to spell him again. Beren held out the captured\nSilmaril in an attempt to slay the beast, but Carcharoth was not\ndaunted, and bit off Beren's hand at the wrist, Silmaril and all.

With the power of the Silmaril inside him, the Girdle of Melian\nhad no effect on him, and his presence placed the entire kingdom in\ngrave danger. To protect Doriath, Beren Erchamion, Elu Thingol, Beleg\nCúthalion, and Mablung joined with Huan the Hound to track down and slay\nthe Wolf. Carcharoth was killed in single combat by Huan in FA 466, but\nboth Huan and Beren were mortally wounded by the poison in Carcharoth's\nteeth.

A lover of\nwater, Ulmo was one of the Arda's chief architects and was always in a\nclose friendship with Manwë. He always distrusted Melkor, and the Dark\nLord feared the Sea almost as much as he feared Varda because the sea\ncannot be tamed. Ulmo had no dwelling in Valinor or any permanent\ndwelling on land, as he preferred the deeps of the seas and the rivers.\nHis palace, on the bottom of Vaiya, was called Ulmonan. Biography Ulmo\nseldom came to the Councils of Máhanaxar, and only when in great need.\nHe preferred to stay in Arda, not by walking on the land, as his form\nwould fill man or elf with great dread. All waters were under his\ngovernment: bays, rivers and even the waters under the earth. Where the\npower of Morgoth was strong, however, Ulmo's own power would be sapped\nfrom waters near to Morgoth's corruption. It is through the rivers that\nhe kept in touch with Arda, and thus knew more of the goings on with the\nChildren of Ilúvatar than even Manwë, for in that way he lived in the\nvery veins of the world. His visible form caused fear in mortals and\neven the Elves, as he dressed like a giant wave in glittering green\narmour, blowing his great horns, the Ulumúri. Ulmo always loved the\nEldar and the Edain, even when the Valar forsook Middle-earth. He\nopposed Oromë's plan to bring the elves to Aman, but helped those that\nwere willing to reach it. He uprooted a large island which was later\nknown as Tol Eressëa and used it to ferry them across the Belegaer to\nthe Blessed Realm. Afterwards, he anchored it in the Bay of Eldamar,\nwhich he did because he knew the minds of the Teleri. Ulmo was the Vala\nmost responsible for the fall of Morgoth, by urging Turgon to build\nGondolin and Finrod to build Nargothrond (FA 50). He appeared before\nTuor and urged him to go to Gondolin as a messenger to Turgon. When he\ngot there, he eventually married Turgon's daughter Idril and fathered\nEärendil. Ulmo saved Eärendil's wife Elwing from the sack of the Havens\nof Sirion, allowing her to take a Silmaril to her husband, which allowed\nhim to gain admittance to Valinor and plead for aid. Ulmo also defended\nthem in the council from the potential wrath of Mandos.

It is unknown whether this whale was actually an Ainur to have\nshape like other races of possible Ainur such as the Great Eagles.\nThrough these Maiar, Ulmo learned much of the Elves.

She lived with her mother\nGaladriel in Eregion, and later fled to Lórinand sometime between SA\n1350 and SA 1400. After a time, Galadriel and Celebrían passed through\nMoria and dwelt in Rivendell. There, she met Elrond who loved her,\nthough he said nothing about it.\n\nIn TA 109, Elrond wedded Celebrían. She bore him twin sons, Elladan and\nElrohir in TA 130, and then a daughter, Arwen in TA 241.\n\nIn TA 2509, Celebrían was on her way to visit her parents in Lothlórien\nwhen she was waylaid by Orcs in the Redhorn Pass of the Misty Mountains.\nShe was then tormented by the orcs and received a poisoned wound. Her\nsons arrived much later to rescue her, and Elrond to heal her, but\nCelebrían was never fully-healed in mind and spirit. Horrified and\nhaunted by the fearful memories of her torture, she no longer desired to\nremain on Middle-earth, and sailed west the next year in the TA 2510.\n\n\nLater mentions\n\nThere are several references of Celebrían in _The Lord of the Rings_,\nsuch as the mention of her torment and being the daughter of\nGaladriel.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name CELEBRÍAN means “Silver queen”, from the Sindarin words\n_celeb_ (“silver”) and _rían_ (“queen”).\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn earlier writings, Amroth the King of Lothlórien was the son of\nCeleborn and Galadriel, and the brother of Celebrían. It was said that\nGaladriel fled with Amroth and Celebrían to Lothlórien. When Galadriel\nand Celebrían left for Rivendell, Amroth was left in the forest, and\nwould later visit his family when they lived in Dol Amroth.\n\nIn other versions, Celebrían wedded Elrond in TA 2500, but in TA 2600,\nshe was slain (not captured) by the Orcs in the Misty Mountains. Her\nchildren were Elladan and Elrohir, and Finduilas (later Arwen).\n\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nTolkien has said that “after the destruction of the Ruling Ring the\nThree Rings of the Eldar lost their virtue. Then Elrond prepared at last\nto depart from Middle-earth and follow Celebrían.” Thus it passed\nthat after 500 long years, at the Haven of Avallonë in Tol Eressëa,\nElrond and Celebrían were finally reunited, sometime after TA 3021 (the\nRing-bearer sailing on September 29, 3021). However, Elrond was then\n“sundered” forever from his beloved daughter.\n\nBjörn Fromén has composed an evocative poem, Celebrían's Farewell to\nElrond, _Valinórenna_.",

She was known as _VÁNA THE EVER-YOUNG_. \nBiography Vána was the younger sister of Yavanna (_Queen of the Earth_)\nand the wife of Oromë (_Huntsman of the Valar_). In Vána's dwellings she\nhad gardens filled with golden flowers; and often, Vána came to the\nforests of Oromë. Like her sister, the province of Vána was growing\nthings of the world and she was a lover of nature. Vána had influence\nwith the flora and fauna of Middle-earth, and she was associated\nespecially with flowers thus Vána was also known as the “Queen of\nFlowers”. It was said that when the Valar Tulkas & Nessa were wedded on\nthe Isle of Almaren, the first dwelling of the Valar, Vána robed her\nsister-in-law _Nessa the Swift_ (sister of Oromë) with her flowers. In\nthe Days of the Two Trees of Valinor, Arien of the Maiar, before she\ncame to carry the vessel of the Sun, had served Vána by tending to the\ngolden flowers of Vána's gardens watering them with bright dews from the\ngreat golden Tree Laurelin. Melian also was another Maia who initially\nserved Vána before she departed for Middle-earth. After the Darkening of\nValinor and the flight of the Noldor to Middle-Earth, most of the Valar\nwere glad to have their ancient peace back, wishing neither the rumors\nof Melkor and his violence nor the murmur of the restless Noldor to come\nupon them again. Thus for such reasons, they clamored for the\nconcealment of their land Aman. It was said that Vána was one among\nthem. Character According to _The Silmarillion_, “All flowers spring as\nVána passes and opens if she glances upon them; and all birds sing at\nher coming.” Vána robed herself in flowers and it was said that her hair\nwas golden in color. Vána had the beauty of both heaven and earth upon\nher face and in all her works. Like Nessa, Vána also sang and danced\nalong with her maidens. The Maiar of Vána - Arien, the Maia who guided\nthe Sun, was one of her Maiar in Valinor. - Melian, who later in\nMiddle-earth became Queen of Doriath by marrying the Elf-King Thingol.\nEtymology The name _VÁNA_ may have been derived from the Quenya word\n_vanima_ (“beautiful”), as she is often described as “fair”.

He was presumably the greatest of all\nthe Eagles in terms of size, with his wingspan measuring at 30 fathoms\n(180 feet). Biography Thorondor was sent by Manwë, King of the Valar, to\nwatch over the Ñoldor after they arrived in Beleriand. The Eldar first\nencountered him when he helped Fingon rescue Maedhros from imprisonment\nfrom Thangorodrim, upon which he had apparently made his home for a\nshort time. After that, Thorondor and the rest of the Eagles settled in\nthe Crissaegrim. When Gondolin was built, Thorondor became the ever\nvigilant guardian of the city. He rescued Fingolfin's body from\ndefilement after Morgoth killed him, giving the Dark Lord a scar on his\nface. He, Landroval, and Gwaihir rescued Beren and Lúthien when Angband\nwas aroused. When Gondolin fell, Thorondor rescued the survivors. During\nthe War of Wrath, Thorondor and Eärendil led the Eagles in battle with\nthe Dragons, and may have fought with Ancalagon the Black. Fate In\nTolkien's writings, Thorondor is not mentioned after the War of Wrath.\nIt is believed he returned to Valinor, although his descendants remained\nbehind. Gwaihir became the Lord of Eagles in Middle-earth after\nThorondor's departure. Etymology The name _THORONDOR_ was Sindarin for\n“Eagle Lord”, from the words _thoron_ (“eagle”) and _taur_ (“lord,\nking”). Thorondor was also named SORONTAR, which was the\nQuenyan translation of his Sindarin name and came from the words _soron_\n(“eagle”) and _tar_ (“king”).",

    "text": "NIENNA (Quenya; IPA or - “Weeping” or “She Who Weeps”) was an Ainu, one\nof the Aratar and a Vala who was responsible for the mercy and grief\nspread across Arda. She was the sister of Mandos and Irmo and had no\nspouse. Her part in the Music of the Ainur was one of deep sadness, from\nwhich grief entered the world at its beginning. She had dominion over\nthe Halls of Nienna, which were on the western edge of Valinor, looking\nover the sea. Biography Nienna was concerned with mourning, and she\npitied the suffering of others, especially the Marring of Arda by\nMelkor. Yet the lesson of Nienna is not of endless grief, but rather of\npity, hope, and the endurance of the spirit. Nienna dwelt in far western\nValinor near Mandos, and she seldom came to Valimar. Her windows looked\nout beyond the Walls of the Night. During the creation of the Two Trees,\nshe watered the mound with her tears. The pity of Nienna is most clearly\nseen in her support for Melkor when he sued for the pardon of the Valar.\nThough she spent her time in the world mourning for the destruction he\nhad wreaked in Arda, when he sued for release after his three ages of\nCaptivity, Nienna spoke on his behalf. After the Flight of the Ñoldor,\nNienna mourned for the destruction of the Two Trees, and her tears\nbrought healing, but could not heal the mortal wounds. Thus, the trees\nbrought forth their last flower and fruit, and made into the Sun and\nMoon. All that is known about her appearance is that she wore a grey\nhood. Given that Gandalf was her greatest student, his being clothed in\ngrey may have been a mark of respect to his teacher. Maiar of Nienna -\nOlórin (Gandalf), Nienna's greatest pupil among all the others who dwell\nin the Halls of Awaiting. She taught him pity and many other things\nbefore he was chosen as the second wizard sent to lead the people of\nMiddle-earth into standing against Sauron. Etymology _NIENNA_ means\n''weeping ''or ''she who weeps _in Quenya and_ _comes_ ''from the root\n_nei_ (“tear”). Other versions of the legendarium In earlier versions,\nNienna was the sister of Manwë and Melkor, and was called “queen of\nshadow”. In _The Book of Lost Tales 1_, a character similar to Nienna\nwas called FUI (Night), the Death-Goddess. In Gnomish she was FUIL, the\nQueen of the Dark. She dwelt in halls that bore her name, and had a roof\nof bats' wings. As _Fui_, she was the spouse of Vefantur (Mandos in\nTolkien's later writings) and dwelt in his halls of Ve. She judged the\nhumans while Vefantur judged the elves. HESKIL (Winter One) and NÚRI\n(One who Sighs) were her names as well. She was also called QALME-TARI\n(Mistress of Death). Similarly, Vairë was an elven storyteller in\nTolkien's early writings, but in his later writings Vairë was the wife\nof Mandos and was responsible for weaving the story of the World.

When the\nÑoldor returned to Middle-earth, he together with Angrod held the\nnorthern slopes of the highlands of Dorthonion against Morgoth\nthroughout the time of the Siege of Angband.\n\nAegnor never married but he was in love with the Bëorian wise-woman\nAndreth, and she returned his feelings. They spent much time discussing\nMen and Elves and their fates in the world, which are fully explained in\nthe _Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth_.

She was wise in thought and\nlearned in the lore of Men and thus was called '''Saelind\n_'(_Wise-heart) ''by the Elves of her time. In her earlier life she\nlived in the house of Belemir in Ladros, where she had learned the lore\nof the House of Marach from Adanel.\n\nAndreth was deeply in love with Aegnor, son of Finarfin. The love was\nreturned but never fulfilled, since Aegnor departed from motives of\nwisdom as he felt his coming death, thus they never married and had no\nchildren. She had a close friendship with Aegnor's brother Finrod\nFelagund, who often visited her during the Siege of Angband to converse\nand debate with her on the matters of Elves and Men. One such\nconversation was written down and later known as _ATHRABETH FINROD AH\nANDRETH_, where she and Finrod discussed differences between Elves and\nMen.\n\n\n\nShe probably died when Morgoth broke the Siege of Angband in Dagor\nBragollach in FA 455 of causes unknown. She was the only known person\nof Mankind to have had a romantic relationship with someone of Elvenkind\nbefore Beren.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Andreth_ was a Sindarin word that meant “patience”. The first\nelement of her name may have come from the word _and_, meaning “long”,\npossibly alluding to a meaning such as “long lasting”, although the\nsecond element _reth_ is more difficult to decipher and appears to have\nno immediate explanation.\n\nAs said, Andreth was also known as SAELIND, meaning “wise heart”,\nwhich comes from the Sindarin words SAEL, meaning 'wise', and IND,\nmeaning “inner thought” or “heart”.\n\n\nOther accounts\n\nAndreth had once prophesied that Túrin would return from the dead in the\nlast days to fight in the Last Battle against Morgoth and the dark\nforces.\n\nEarlier names\n\n''Saelon ''and _Saelin_ were two names Tolkien came up with that\npreceded _Saelind_.",

Biography The Great Goblin was a Goblin chieftain of the Misty\nMountains. He was a very large creature with a huge head. He was the\nchief of a group of goblins who lived in Goblin-town near the High Pass.\nThey preyed on travellers who used another, easier pass near the main\ngate of Goblin-town until people started avoiding that route over the\nmountains. The goblins then made another gate that opened into a cave\nthat they called the Front Porch, at the top of the High Pass. The Great\nGoblin also sometimes ordered his goblins to catch fish for him in\nGollum's Lake, and these goblins were sometimes killed by Gollum. In the\nsummer of TA 2941, the Dwarves of Thorin and Company, along with Bilbo\nBaggins, were captured on the Front Porch and were brought before the\nGreat Goblin in his great cave, where he was seated on a flat stone and\nsurrounded by armed guards. The Great Goblin demanded to know what the\nDwarves were doing in the mountains. (He seems less hostile in this\npassage than the Orcs are during the later War of the Ring, as his\nquestioning seems to imply that he has not decided beforehand whether he\nwill order the party killed, make them slaves, or even let them go, but\nthat he will decide according to their answers. It is also possible he\nwas just toying with the group and would kill them afterwards.) When it\nwas revealed that Thorin carried the Elvish sword Orcrist - which the\nOrcs and goblins fear and which they called “Biter” - the Great Goblin\nwas enraged and at once leapt to attack Thorin. Immediately, all the\ntorches in the cave were extinguished and a glowing sword “bright as\nblue flame” appeared. It was Glamdring, called “Beater” by the goblins,\nand now wielded by Gandalf. As the Dwarves were escaping, the Great\nGoblin leapt down in front of them, and attacked Gandalf who was at the\nhead of the party. Gandalf then fought back, stabbing the Great Goblin\nand killing him. The death of the Great Goblin angered the goblins of\nthe Misty Mountains.

He was also called TULUKASTĀZ or ASTALDO. Biography Having\nheard of his fellow Valar's struggle against Melkor, Tulkas was the last\nof the Valar to descend upon Arda, thus tipping the scales of battle\nagainst Melkor. Melkor fled before him, and the Spring of Arda was\nbegun. After the Two Lamps were erected and the Valar had made their\nfirst dwelling at Almaren, Tulkas wedded Nessa in a great feast. Being\nweary and content he slept, and Melkor decided his hour to retaliate had\ncome. When the Children of Ilúvatar awoke, there was a council among the\nValar regarding Melkor. Much to Tulkas's delight, it was decided that\nMelkor should be removed. During the War for Sake of the Elves, he\nwrestled with Melkor and bound him with Angainor, which was forged by\nAulë. Upon Melkor's release from captivity, Tulkas remained vigilant and\ndistrustful of him. Character Tulkas is described as delighting in\nwrestling and contests of strength. He wields no weapon, and rides no\nsteed. As he cares little about either past or future, he was not a good\ncouncillor, but nonetheless a very hardy friend. He is described as\nbeing slow to wrath, but also slow to forgive; for that reason, he was\none of the Valar that opposed the release of Melkor. In appearance,\nTulkas was described to have ruddy flesh and golden hair and beard. He\nalso tended to be impatient; before the Awakening of the Elves he urged\nthe other Valar to wage war against Melkor. After the Darkening of\nValinor he also hurried Fëanor to take a decision about surrendering the\nSilmarils. Tulkas was known for laughing in sport and in battle. He was\npossibly the only being on Arda with the courage to laugh in the face of\nMelkor, the most powerful being in Valinor (at the time) - and did so\nonce while engaged in battle with him. Despite not being one of the\nAratar, Morgoth feared Tulkas more than any of the other Valar. He was\nalso the strongest (physically) of all the Valar. Most likely, he was\nphysically stronger than Morgoth, as it was he who first chained him\nwith Angainor. Etymology In Quenya, the name _TULKAS_ means “Strong” and\n“Steadfast”, from the root _tuluk_. His Valarin name is TULUKHASTĀZ,\nwhich means “the golden-haired”, from the words _tulukha(n)_ (“yellow”)\nand _(a)sata-_ (“hair of head”). His Ñoldorin name is TULCUS (“Strong”).\nASTALDO means “the Valiant”. Other names An earlier name for Tulkas was\nTURENBO. Earlier versions of the legendarium In earlier texts, Tulkas\noverthrows Melkor during the battle of the Silent Pools and bounds him\nfor Lumbi. Here, the Hound of Mandos, Gorgumoth, guards Melkor in his\ncaptivity. In an earlier context, Tulkas had a son Telimektar, “whose\ntale is yet to tell”. Gallery",

Later, when Lúthien learned that Sauron had imprisoned Beren,\nshe sought Daeron's counsel but he betrayed her to the king, causing her\nto be imprisoned in Hírilorn. After she had escaped and went away to\nfind Beren and was feared to be lost, Daeron repented his previous deeds\nand left Doriath to search for her in vain. He lost his way somewhere in\nthe far East of Middle-earth, where he dwelt in dark places lamenting\nhis love for Lúthien. His fate or whereabouts afterwards in the world\nare not known. Legacy His invention of the Cirth provided an alphabet of\nrunes that the Dwarves adopted in their writings and spread throughout\nMiddle-earth, passing them down from age to age. These runes would later\nbecome the script used in Moria and were known as Daeron's Runes.\nEtymology His name is derived from the Sindarin word _daer_ (“large,\ngreat”). In earlier etymologies of the legendarium the Doriathrin name\nis given as _DAIRON_, of which the root was the Doriathrin word\nfor shadow, _dai_. Consequently, Christopher Tolkien speculated in _The\nSilmarillion _that the name perhaps included the Sindarin\nword _dae_ “shadow”. See Also - Cirth",

    "text": "AULË (Quenya; IPA: - “Invention”) was an Ainur, one of the Aratar and a\nValar, who was responsible for fashioning and crafting the substances of\nwhich Arda, the world, was composed. He was also called '''Mahal\n'''(Khuzdul; IPA: “Maker”), '''Oli '''(Sindarin; IPA: “Dream”) or\nNÁVATAR and delights in the nature of substances and in works of skill,\nbut not concerned with possession or mastery. Besides the shaping of\nArda, Aulë's greatest works were the Two Lamps of the Valar, the vessels\nof the Sun and Moon, and the Dwarves, whom he created out of impatience\nfor the Children of Ilúvatar. He also created Angainor (the chain of\nMelkor). Biography As Aulë was a smith, he was the Valar most similar in\nthought and powers to Melkor, in that they each gloried in the\nfashioning of artful and original things. Both also came to create\nbeings of their own. But while Aulë strove to be true to the original\nintent of the Music of the Ainurs, and submitted all that he did to the\nwill of Ilúvatar, Melkor wished to control and subvert all things, and\nwas jealous of the creations of others so that he would try to twist or\ndestroy all that they made. There was long strife between Aulë and\nMelkor both before and after the creation of Arda. Aulë, however,\ntraditionally opposed attempts to fight Melkor, for fear of the damage\nthat would be wrought to Arda. When the Elves came to Valinor, the\nÑoldor became the students of Aulë. Fëanor was his greatest pupil, and\nfrom him learned to make gems through craftsmanship that is now\nforgotten. This would eventually lead to the Silmarils, the greatest\ncreation of handiwork within Arda. On the Flight of the Noldor, the\nNoldor who returned to Valinor under Finarfin named themselves the\n_Aulendur_, Followers of Aulë. Despite his lordly skill, Aulë was humble\nand compassionate, and indeed the Dwarves survived only because Aulë\nsubmitted them to the will of Ilúvatar. His spouse was Yavanna, with\nwhom he dwelt in central Valinor. The Creation of the Dwarves Desperate\nfor pupils onto whom he could pass his knowledge, and unwilling to wait\nfor the emergence of the Children of Ilúvatar, Aulë created his own race\nof beings, the dwarves. However, he did not have a clear idea of what\nthe Children of Ilúvatar would be like, and because of the presence of\nthe chaos caused by Melkor, Aulë made the Dwarves strong and unyielding,\nand not willing to endure the domination of others, as well as embodying\nsome of his values and desires for Middle-earth. However Aulë did not\nhave the power to give independent life to his creations, they could act\nonly when his thought was on them. When Aulë completed his work he began\nto instruct the Dwarves in a language he had made for them, Khuzdul.\nThen Ilúvatar spoke to Aulë, asking why he would seek to exceed his\npower and authority by attempting to make new life. Aulë repented,\nanswering that the drive to create was kindled in him by Ilúvatar, and\nthat he only wished for other beings to love and teach, with whom to\nshare in the beauty of the world. He admitted that his impatience had\ndriven him to folly and submitted his creations to Ilúvatar. Assuming\nthat they should be destroyed, he made to smite the seven Fathers of the\nDwarves with a great hammer.  As he raised the hammer the Dwarves shrank\nfrom the coming blow, but Ilúvatar stayed Aulë's hand and showed that he\nhad accepted Aulë's offer by gifting the Dwarves with spirits of their\nown, else they could not have been afraid. Ilúvatar accepted the Dwarves\nas his adopted children however, as it was ordained that the elves were\nto be the first-born race, Ilúvatar set the Dwarves to sleep until after\nthe Awakening of the Elves. He told Aulë that while both were his\nchildren, their creation was outside the scope of the Music of the\nAinur, and strife would arise between the Dwarven race and the Elven\nrace as the events of the world unfolded. The Dwarves believe that after\nthey die their spirits move to halls that Aulë has set aside for them\nalone, and that their role will be to rebuild Arda after the Final\nBattle. Maiar of Aulë - Mairon (Sauron), the mightiest of the Maiar of\nAulë who used his knowledge of the metaphysical structure of Arda to\ngreat effect as a servant of Melkor in the First Age of Middle-earth and\nthen was his own master in the Second and Third Ages. When Sauron sought\nto corrupt the elves in the Second Age one of the names he assumed was\nAulendil, meaning devotee of Aulë.   - Curumo (Saruman), the leader of\nthe wizards sent to lead the people of Middle-earth against Sauron, only\nto betray his fellow wizards and ally with Sauron himself (who he also\nbetrayed in the end). It is interesting to note that two of the greatest\nMaiar sent to Middle-earth, that fell, were in the beginning both\naligned with Aulë. The reason for this is probably that this is the\norder most associated with craft, skill, and by these means, power.\nWeaker-willed spirits often fall prey to craving for power in Tolkien's\nworks, and these prove no exception. Also, Tolkien generally sees\nindustry as corruption. It seems Maiar of Aulë are the most powerful\nMaia because they are the closest to Ilúvatar's creation skills. Powers\nAulë seems to have a power most akin to Ilúvatar's - he can create an\ninnumerable amount of things. He made the Two Lamps, and made Angainor,\nMorgoth's chain. Although he does not have access to the Flame\nImperishable, he was able to create life (although it does not have free\nwill). As a Valar, he possesses incredible strength, and has been noted\nto have rebuilt Arda during and after Morgoth's period of destruction\nbefore the coming of the Elves. He likely forged the Valar's weaponry\nand armor for the War of Wrath. His strength is in the construction of\nnew things, and he is as near to the antithesis of the destructive\nMorgoth as one can be.﻿ Etymology _Aulë_ means ''invention ''in Quenya.\n_Mahal_ means ''maker ''in Khuzdul. _Oli_ means _dream_ in Sindarin.",

Biography After\nEärendil made his journey to Valinor to convince the Valar to overthrow\nMorgoth and rescue the overmatched and defeated Elves and Edain, The\nHost of Valinor made war upon Morgoth and destroyed his armies. Facing\nfinal defeat, Morgoth unleashed his last and greatest weapon; a fleet of\nwinged fire drakes, led by Ancalagon. So terrible was their onslaught\nthat the armies of the Valar were driven back from the gates of Angband,\nand their coming was said to have been accompanied by a tempest of fire\nand lightning. But Eärendil came out of the West in his blessed ship\nVingilot, accompanied by the Eagles of Manwë led by Thorondor. The\nEagles and Eärendil dueled with Ancalagon and the other Dragons for an\nentire day. Eventually, Eärendil was victorious, casting Ancalagon down\nupon Thangorodrim and destroying the volcanic mountains in his fall. The\ndeath of Ancalagon marked the end of Morgoth's final resistance.

Other Names The Middle English translation\nfor _Ancalagon_ is ANDRACCA, from _and-_ (“opposition”), _anda_\n(“hatred, envy”), and _draca_ (“dragon”).

He was however, said to be as big\nas a mountain. However, his size is never directly specified and some\npowerful but small creatures are able to cause great destruction even in\ndeath, such as Durin's Bane breaking the slopes of Celebdil.

She became the wife of Eärendil the Mariner,\nand was the mother of Elrond and Elros. Biography Elwing, as well as her\nbrothers, were born in a house near Lanthir Lamath and lived there until\nher father went to Doriath to assume his inheritance as King of Doriath.\nWhen the Sons of Fëanor attacked Doriath, all of her immediate family\nwas either killed or lost, but those loyal to her family took Elwing as\nwell as the Silmaril they sought and bore her away to the Havens of\nSirion. It was at the Havens that Elwing met Eärendil and later married\nhim. She bore him twin sons, Elrond and Elros. Elrond later went on to\nmarry Lady Celebrian, daughter of Lord Celeborn and Lady Galadriel of\nLothlórien. From this marriage they produced three children, Elladan and\nElrohir, twin brothers, and Arwen Undómiel, future Queen of Gondor.\nThese children were therefore Elwing's grandchildren, a privilege shared\nwith the Lord and Lady of Lothlórien. In the present matter at hand,\nElwing was forced to abandon her children when the Sons of Fëanor came\nfor the Silmaril in Elwing's possession. Rather than give it over, she\nthrew herself into the Sea and was transformed into a great white bird.\nShe flew continuously until she found her husband's sailing ship, the\nVingilot. Then, on behalf of the Elves and Men of Middle-earth, they\nchose to sail for Valinor in the faint hope that they could make a final\nplea on behalf of those who suffered under Morgoth. When they arrived,\nElwing chose to accompany her husband onto the shores, even though she\nknew it might mean her death. While Eärendil journeyed to visit the\nValar, Elwing walked the shores, eventually meeting the Elves of\nAlqualondë. There, she told them the tale of what was happening in\nMiddle-earth and became much loved by them. The Valar eventually agreed\nto go to war to aid those in Middle-earth, and also decided to give both\nEärendil and Elwing the choice of which kindred they would belong.\nEärendil, out of respect for his wife, allowed her to choose for the\nboth of them. She chose to be counted among the elves, in honor of her\nforemother, Lúthien. A white tower was later built for Elwing where she\ncould live. It was also said that the birds taught her their language\nand that she would fly to meet Eärendil when he returned from his\nnightly voyages.

He also has responsibility for pronouncing the dooms\nand judgments of Eru Ilúvatar under Manwë. His real name is NÁMO\n(Quenya; IPA: “Ordainer” or “Judge”) but was later known by the Elves as\nMandos after his sacred Halls of Mandos, over which he presides and\nwhere ultimately the Elves go after they are slain. Mandos was the sixth\ngreatest of the Lords of the Valar, and fifth greatest Aratar. Biography\nMandos was the brother of Irmo (Lórien) and Nienna in the mind of Eru\nIlúvatar. He and his brother Lórien are the Fëanturi, the MASTERS OF\nSPIRITS. His wife was Vaire the Weaver. He it was who pronounced Manwë's\nDoom concerning the espousals of the Eldar on YT 1172, when Finwë asked\ncounsel for a second marriage, after the death of his wife's passing to\nthe Halls of Mandos. When Melkor began marring Arda before the coming of\nthe Elves, Tulkas arrived and wanted to make war swiftly. At the bidding\nof Manwë, Mandos pronounced the doom of the Firstborn. After the\ncaptivity of Melkor, Mandos had once again pronounced the Doom. Melkor\nspent three Ages in the duress of Mandos thereafter, guarded by his\nhound Gorgumoth in Lumbi. Mandos judged Fëanor to leave Tirion for\ntwelve years after Fëanor's drawing of sword against Fingolfin. After\nthe destruction of the Two Trees, Yavanna asked for the light of the\nSilmarils, which Fëanor denied and he shall be slain, the first in Aman;\nbut Mandos had spoken and revealed that Finwë was the first, having been\nslain at the steps of Formenos by Melkor. When the Ñoldor revolted\nagainst the Valar, Mandos appeared before them and pronounced the Doom\nof the Ñoldor. Only once has he been moved to pity, when Lúthien sang of\nthe grief she and her lover Beren had experienced in Beleriand. Then,\nwith the Elder King's approval, he released them to Middle-earth to\nbegin their second life there as mortal beings with no certitude of\nlife. When Eärendil arrived in Aman to beg for assistance from the\nValar, Mandos considered Eärendil and Elwing's fate as Half-elven and\ngave them and their descendants a choice: either to be counted among\nElves or Men. Character Mandos, upon appearing before the Ñoldor, was\nreferred to be a dark figure with a loud voice, solemn and terrible. He\nwas described as being stern, dispassionate and never forgetting a\nthing. He was the Vala who cursed the Ñoldor leaving Aman, and\ncounselled against allowing them to return. But unlike Morgoth, his\nDooms are not cruel or vindictive by his own design. They are simply the\nwill of Eru, and he will not speak them unless he is commanded to do so\nby Manwë. Etymology His common name _MANDOS_ means “Prison-fortress”. It\nstems from _Mandost_ (“castle of custody”) or _mbando_ (“custody”) and\n_osto_ (“fortified building or place”). His real name, NÁMO, means\n“Ordainer” or “Judge” in Quenya. Other Names The Old English translation\nfor Mandos is NEFREA “Corpse-ruler” from _neo_ (“corpse”) and _frea_\n(“lord”). His title is NEOAERNA HLAFORD (“Master of the houses of the\ndead”). He was also called MORIMANDO, the “Dark Mando”, as opposed to\nManwë's _Kalamando_, the “Light Mando”. In Tolkien's earlier work,\nMandos was named VEFANTUR. Other versions of the legendarium As\nVefantur, his wife was Fui Nienna and together they were called the\n“Gods of Death”.

    "lotr_page_id": "2378",
    "text": "UNGOLIANT (Sindarin IPA: - “Dark Spider”) was a primordial taking the\nshape of a gigantic spider. She was initially an ally of Melkor in Aman,\nand for a short time in Middle-earth as well. She is the mother of\nShelob, and therefore the oldest, and first spider of the south,\npossibly even the first spider of Arda. Biography Origins The true\norigin of Ungoliant is unknown, and was not even known by the Valar. It\nis said by some that she came from the Darkness itself that lies about\nArda and was once an ally of Melkor when he looked down upon the world\nwith envy. Later, she changed her allegiance from him to herself,\ndesiring only to be a mistress of her own insatiable craving to devour\nall light - to feed her everlasting emptiness. Early years When Melkor\nwas defeated and imprisoned by the Lords of the West after the first\nElves awoke in Cuiviénen, Ungoliant escaped the attacks of the Valar and\nthe hunters of Oromë and fled to the southern part of Aman. There, in a\nravine south of the mountain Hyarmentir, she established her dark abode\nand took the physical form of a monstrous spider, and sucked up all the\nlight she could find. After every feeding, she spun forth dark nets of\ngloom that strangled any light from entering her lair of darkness. Yet\nshe hungered for more of it: for although she hated light, she craved\nits sustenance as well. Alliance with Melkor Eventually, Melkor sought\nout Ungoliant in order to exact his revenge against the Valar and the\nElves. He came to her and told her of his plans. Though she was tempted\ngreatly by Melkor's plan for her to drink the light of the Two Trees of\nValinor, she feared the power of the Valar and was hesitant to accompany\nhim. To mollify her, Melkor offered to sate her hunger with whatever she\nwished if she would aid him in his vengeance. She agreed, and they came\nshortly thereafter to Ezellohar, where she drained the Trees of their\nsap, poisoned them, and drank the Wells of Varda dry. The Unlight\nproduced by Ungoliant stymied the pursuit of Oromë and Tulkas, and\nMelkor escaped to Middle-earth with her. However, her consumption of\npower of the Trees and the Wells caused her to swell to a size and shape\nso vast and hideous that even Melkor began to grow afraid. When they\narrived in Lammoth in Middle-earth, Melkor, now known as Morgoth, hoped\nto escape to the ruins of Angband where the remnants of his forces\nawaited him. Suspecting that he intended to leave his promise to her\nunfulfilled, Ungoliant demanded the gems that Morgoth had stolen from\nFormenos before they could reach Angband. She devoured them, and grew to\nan even more monstrous size. She then demanded that Morgoth surrender to\nher the Silmarils. However, Morgoth refused, and she attacked him.\nWeaving her dark webs, she attempted to enmesh him in her nets and take\nthe Silmarils by force. Morgoth gave out a terrible cry of pain as she\nattacked, which was heard by the Balrogs hibernating under the ruins of\nAngband. They awoke and immediately rushed to the aid of their Lord,\ntearing apart Ungoliant's webbing with their fiery whips and forcing her\nto break off her attack. She fled, and the Balrogs prepared to pursue\nand destroy her, but they were checked by Morgoth, who ordered them to\nreturn with him to Angband. Ungoliant's attack upon Morgoth left an\nechoing scream ever after on the land that gave the area the name\nLammoth, and it is said to this day that when one screams in that place,\nthe voice of the Dark Lord echoes back from the surrounding hills. Final\nYears and Legacy Driven off by the Balrogs, Ungoliant fled to Nan\nDungortheb, where she bred with the Great Spiders that dwelt there,\nincreasing the terror and power of her kind. The creatures that later\ninfested the area were her surviving offspring and descendants,\nincluding her infamous daughter, Shelob, who dwelt from the Second and\nThird Ages onwards on the borders of Mordor, as her last surviving\nchild. It is said that Ungoliant ultimately perished at her own hands\nwhen, in her ever growing and eternal hunger, she eventually devoured\nherself. Others say Ungoliant, after retreating to an isolated island in\nthe Belegaer, was slain by Eärendil, and with her darkness destroyed,\nlight came to many regions from which it had long been hid. Towards the\nend of the First Age, she had captured the sun (Arien/Urwendi) with her\ngloom nets and Earendil encountered her on his journey across the seas\non the Vingilot. Earendil ultimately freed Urwendi freeing the Magic\nSun.Similarly, Tolkien projected a tale wherein Ungoliant ensnared the\nSun in her webs while it sailed under the earth: with the result that\nthe Sun was no longer enchanted, only the Moon: Urwendi imprisoned by\nMóru (upset out of the boat by Melko and only the Moon has been magic\nsince). The Faring Forth and the Battle of Erumáni would release her and\nrekindle the Magic Sun. Tolkien, J. R. R.; John D. Rateliff.

He never entered into the deeps of the seas as\ndid his master but was instead fond of wildness and unpredictability of\ntides along the coastlines of the lands. Uinen was his wife, and he was\na friend of Círdan the Shipwright. Ossë was a friend of the Teleri\nand Sindar of Middle-earth, and was valued as high as the Valar by them.\nDuring the shaping of Arda, Ossë was swayed into entering the service of\nMelkor who offered him the powers of Ulmo and played on his wild and\nsometimes violent desires. Thus, the seas suffered from wanton storms\nwhich came unto the lands, bringing great ruin to them. He was persuaded\nto stop by Uinen under Aulë's bidding, but his taste for violence never\nreally disappeared. The other Valar still loved him but did not\ncompletely trust him. Ossë also obstructed the work by Ulmo and Uin the\ngreat whale by dragging back the island of Tol Eressëa westward, which\nUin (or with Ulmo and possibly other animals as well) carried to Aman.\nDuring the process, the portion of the original island fallen off\nsettled and later became the Isle of Balar. When Fëanor and his people\nperpetrated the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, Ossë, who loved the Teleri\ndeeply, was devastated, but was forbidden by the Valar from intervening\nin the battle. However, after the Ñoldor had completed the massacre and\nstolen the ships of the Teleri, he conjured terrible storms to waylay\nthe Ñoldor, causing the sinking many of the ships. Ossë was responsible\nfor the raising of the island that would be called Númenor. When Ossë\ngrew restless in the Second Age, the mariners of Númenor would call for\nhelp from Uinen to quiet his storms. Etymology Ossë is a Quenya word.\nHis name in Sindarin was Gaerys. Other versions of the legendarium In\nolder versions of _The Silmarillion_, Ossë was a Vala in his own right,\nand often opposed the will of Ulmo.",

    "text": "HUAN was a great wolfhound of the First Age. He was given by the Vala\nOromë the Hunter to his friend Celegorm, one of the Sons of Fëanor. Huan\nwas as large as a small horse, and accompanied Celegorm on his huntings.\nWhen the Ñoldor under Fëanor rebelled, Huan went with his master to\nMiddle-earth. Huan had been granted special powers by the Valar, and was\nallowed to speak three times before he died. It was also prophesied that\nhe could not be killed unless it was by the greatest wolf that ever\nlived. Biography Huan was originally a Hound of Oromë in Valinor and was\neventually given to Celegorm, Fëanor's third son. He went into exile\nwith his master during the Flight of the Ñoldor. He might have stayed\nwith his master in Himlad and later fled with him to Nargothrond after\ntheir defeat in the Dagor Bragollach. He became involved with the Quest\nfor the Silmaril. When Beren had left Lúthien and gone with Finrod\nFelagund to Angband but had been captured in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, Lúthien\nset out to rescue him. She was intercepted by Celegorm and Curufin, who\nwere living in Nargothrond at the time and were hunting. Huan smelt\nLúthien and captured her, and she was brought before Celegorm. Celegorm\nand Curufin did not reveal to her that they had sent Beren to his death\nby the hand of Sauron, and took her as a prisoner to Nargothrond, “for\nher own protection”, secretly plotting to wed her to Celegorm and\nthereby force an alliance with Lúthien's father Thingol. Huan felt pity\nfor Lúthien, and sought her out. Speaking for the first time, he told\nher of a way to escape, using a secret exit, and then accompanied her to\nTol-in-Gaurhoth where, with the help of Lúthien's magic, he killed all\nof Sauron's werewolves until Sauron himself came out, knowing of the\nprophesy about Huan's death he took the shape of the greatest wolf that\nhad ever lived up to that point. Huan nevertheless managed to defeat\nhim, and Sauron was forced to flee. Huan went back to his master, while\nLúthien and Beren went on their way back to Doriath, they came across\nCelegorm and Curufin once more, who had been exiled from Nargothrond by\nOrodreth when he learned of their deeds. Curufin tried to kill Lúthien,\nbut Huan turned against his master, defending Beren and Lúthien.\nSpeaking for the second time, Huan told Beren and Lúthien of his plan to\ngain entrance to Angband, bringing them the skin of the werewolf\nDraugluin and the bat-skin of Sauron's messenger Thuringwethil. Using\nthese skins as disguise Beren and Lúthien went to Angband, while Huan\nhunted in the wild. After Beren and Lúthien had won the Silmaril but\nBeren had lost his hand to the werewolf Carcharoth, Huan joined Beren,\nThingol, Beleg Cúthalion and Mablung in the Hunt for the Wolf. Huan and\nBeren managed to kill Carcharoth, but Huan was mortally wounded.\nSpeaking for the third and last time, he wished Beren and Lúthien\nfarewell, and died. Etymology _HUAN_ literally means “great dog, hound”,\nderiving from the Sindarin _hû_ (“hound”). In Quenya, Huan also means\n“hound”, which comes from the word _khugan_ or _hunen_. Other versions\nin the legendarium In earlier texts, Huan was described to be the\n“Captain of Dogs” and a rival to Tevildo (later Sauron), the Prince of\nCats. Here, Huan met Tinuviel (Lúthien), who was initially afraid and\nfled from him. With his speed Huan overtook her in two leaps and spoke\n“soft and deep the tongue of the Lost Elves”.",

Biography Beleg “followed no man”, and\n“could not be restrained”.

Beleg found the band of outlaws Turin was leading\nwhile Turin was away scouting, and was tortured by the outlaws until\nTurin found and released him.

Mablung was present when Túrin fought\nwith Saeros over his taunting and restrained Túrin's wrath to avoid a\nbrawl in the King's hall. Mablung then attempted to stop Saeros from\ntaking his threats too far and warned him of Túrin's strength, should he\nattempt to fight him. Aware that a fight had broken out between the two,\nMablung was present at the final play in the drama and tried to stop\nthings from ending badly. It was to no avail Saeros ran despairingly in\nfear and fell off a brink where a stream ran into the Esgalduin, and\nstruck his head on a rock and died. Later, Mablung was present before\nThingol's throne where he accounted for everything that had gone on\nbetween Saeros and Túrin, and later accounts of Túrin’s choice to leave\nDoriath. Mablung became captain of the guard of Doriath after Beleg left\nto seek Túrin. When Morwen Eledhwen, who dwelt in Doriath at the time,\nlearned of the fall of Nargothrond and that her son Túrin might be\nthere, she wished to seek him out. Mablung was assigned by Thingol to\nguard her on their way. Unknown to both Mablung and Morwen until too\nlate, Nienor daughter of Morwen, had joined them. Mablung was unable to\nprevent them both from being ensnared in the traps of Glaurung, the\ndragon of Morgoth. Mablung hid from Glaurung and then searched the\nsacked Nargothrond, finding no sign of Túrin.  Nienor was found again by\nMablung, in a trance, by the spell of Glaurung, at Amon Ethir. Mablung\nthen led her back to Doriath, but he later lost her again when she ran\noff unclad started by a band of Orcs; a result of the spell of Glaurung.\nThus she fled beyond the sight of Mablung. Unable to recover her Mablung\nreturned to Doriath, but he spent years afterwards searching for Morwen\nand Nienor. Mablung went to Brethil when he learned Glaurung was there,\nand there met Túrin. By admitting Nienor was lost he caused Túrin to\nrealize that Níniel his wife had actually been his sister Nienor and\nTúrin killed himself.

He\nfought many battles in the name of his master Morgoth, and was\npersonally responsible for killing two of the High Kings of the Ñoldor.\nGothmog, like the rest of his kind, carried a fiery whip into battle,\nbut he was also known to have wielded a great black axe, which was\nfeared by elves across the continent of Beleriand. Biography Gothmog was\ninitially one of the Maiar who were under the allegiance of Melkor.\nPrior to the Revolt of the Ñoldor, he was the High Captain of Angband\nand given the title “Lord of the Balrogs.” During the Dagor-nuin-Giliath\nin YT 1498, Fëanor pressed to Angband with his company, and in that\nhour, the Balrogs were issued forth. Gothmog was among them. Fëanor came\neven within sight of Angband, but was ambushed with few elves about him.\nSoon he stood alone, but long he fought on alone with all balrogs.\nGothmog turned in at the end of the bout, and at the last Gothmog, Lord\nof the Balrogs, smote him to the ground, inflicting a mortal wound, and\nthe High King of the Ñoldor plunged to the ground. The Sons of Fëanor\narrived and carried the body of their father away, but Fëanor had\npassed. Gothmog reappeared as a general of Angband in several more major\nconflicts, including the Dagor Aglareb and the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.\nDuring the Nirnaeth, Gothmog engaged the High King of the Ñoldor,\nFingon, in battle. Gothmog separated Fingon from the main host but was\nunable to kill Fingon until another Balrog appeared behind the Ñoldor\n“cast a throng of steel about him”. This allowed Gothmog to slay Fingon\nand beat the body to dust. Thereafter, he captured Húrin, father of\nTúrin Turambar, and dragged him back to Angband. In FA 510, Gothmog and\nthe forces of Angband beseiged the Hidden City of Gondolin. They held\nthe northern gates and were later confronted by Ecthelion of the\nFountain, whom Gothmog dueled. Knocking Ecthelion's sword out of his\nhands, Gothmog prepared to strike at him but, as he raised his axe,\nEcthelion ran forward at the Balrog lord, ramming his pointed helmet\ninto the beast's chest and forcing both of them into the Fountain of the\nKing. The waters quenched the flames of Gothmog that kept him alive and\ndrowned Ecthelion, ending the Battle of Gondolin. Etymology The name\n_Gothmog_ is from the Quenyan terms _gos_ or _goth_ (“dread”) and\n_-mbaw_ (“compel, force, subject, oppress”). Gothmog's Quenya name was\nOSOMBAUKO (or OÞOMBAUKO; IPA: or Vanyarin ). His name in Sindarin means\n“Strife and Hate”. Other versions of the legendarium Gothmog was briefly\nconceived as a “son of Melkor and the ogress Fuithluin”, and went by the\nname of KOSOMOT. The root of the name _moko_ translates to “hate”. There\nwas another concept of the Children of the Ainur, Melkor had a son\nKosomot (later Gothmog) with an ogress called Fuithluin. Gallery",

    "text": "NELLAS was an Elf Maiden of Doriath during the First Age. Biography\nBeing a lady of nature, she lived in the woods and never came to the\ncity but she knew much of things and was very wise. Nellas was young\nduring the latter-half of the fourth century First Age and it was during\nthat time that Túrin had come to Doriath as a boy. With the blessings of\nMelian, she befriended him and became his teacher and he learned much\nabout the wilderness and nature. She also taught him an older and richer\nform of Sindarin and the many manners of its pronunciation. As he began\nto grow into manhood, he drifted away from her but she still continued\nto watch over him be it in secrecy. Sitting in a tree watching over him,\nshe witnessed the incident between Túrin and Saeros and saw that Saeros\nhad indeed provoked Túrin and was the cause of his own peril. Summoned\nto appear before the King in one of the few times she walked in the\ncity, she told him about what happen in the woods with great difficulty.\nAfter the King pronounced his judgment, she wept over Túrin’s departure\nand sought to find him but presumably she never saw him again. Her fate\nis unknown in the latter days of the First Age. Etymology Although there\nappears to be no clear origin of the name NELLAS, it is likely to have\nbeen Sindarin and may have come from the Sindarin words NELLAD, NELLA or\nNELLADEL, which all mean “the sound of bells” (or “to sound the bells”),\nor perhaps the word NELL, meaning “bell”. The element NEL- may also\nconnect with Elvish words for the number “three”, and the final -LAS\ncould mean “leaf” (as in the name LEGOLAS, Greenleaf), though it is not\napparent why a child should be called by a name meaning something like\n“three leaves”.

However it is possible that Scatha was a remnant of the dragons\nof Morgoth that fled into Northeast after the War of Wrath at the end of\nthe First Age. It is not certain whether Scatha was the dragon which\nkilled Dain I and his son Frór. He appeared in the Third Age, and his\nlair was in the southern slopes of the Grey Mountains. He greatly\ntroubled the Dwarves and Men living in the lands North of the Wilderland\nand had stolen a great deal of their treasure. He was slain by the\nÉothéod leader Fram, son of Frumgar (an ancestor of Eorl the Young) in\nthe early days of the Éothéod (roughly TA 2000). After Scatha's demise,\npeace came to the land save for a dispute over his stolen treasure. In\nhis hoard was found a silver horn, the Horn of Rohan later given to\nMeriadoc Brandybuck by Éowyn.

    "text": "CÍRDAN, also known as NOWË and CÍRDAN THE SHIPWRIGHT, was a Telerin Elf\n(of which he was one of the wisest princes), a great mariner and\nshipwright in Middle-earth.\n\nCírdan was the lord of the Falas and then of the Balar during much of\nthe First Age, one of the wisest and perhaps the mightiest of the\nMoriquendi. He was the bearer of the Great Ring Narya, which he in turn\ngave to Gandalf.\n\nHe was kin to both Elwë and Olwë. He may have also been related to Elmo,\nthe lesser known brother of Elwë.\n\nHe is one of the three oldest living elves in Middle-earth at the end of\nthe Third Age, along with Galadriel and Celeborn, who were all born\nduring the Years of the Trees. At the end of the Third Age, there were\nno other elves who had been alive at the start of the First Age. Círdan\nis one of two elves, the other being Celeborn, to have spent the most\ntime in Middle-Earth of any elf by being present in more ages than any\nother elf. Círdan and Celeborn were in Arda from sometime late in the\nYears of the Trees, through the First Age, until the Fourth Age. Tolkien\nhas written that Círdan would sail on the last ship into the West, as he\nis the Lord of the Grey Havens. So, it can thus be known that Círdan had\nthe longest incarnated single life span of any elf, having entered Arda\nduring the Years of the Trees and having left for Valinor later in the\nFourth Age than any other Elf.[1]\n\n\nBiography\n\nFirst Age\n\nAfter the Teleri Elves Arrive to Aman\n\nIn the First Age, Círdan was a ruler of a host of the Teleri under Elwë,\nand during the long wait in Beleriand he fell in love with the sea. When\nUlmo returned for the Teleri, Círdan and his followers remained behind,\npartially because of their love for Belegaer, and partially because of\nhis kinship with Elwë, who was lost. After Elwë returned and became King\nThingol, Círdan ruled the Falathrim of the havens of Eglarest and\nBrithombar, although he seemed to have accepted Thingol's overlordship.\nLater he became an advisor and friend of Finrod Felagund, Lord of\nNargothrond, although the Falas remained independent.\n\n[Círdan in a earlier age, by Szilvia Szarvas]\n\nWars of Beleriand\n\nCírdan was early on warned by Ulmo not to attempt a crossing to Valinor,\nand his mariners restricted their work to the coasts of Middle-earth.\nHowever, at the request of King Turgon of Gondolin, he later built\nseveral messenger ships to sail to Valinor to request help from the\nValar against Morgoth. All these missions failed, and only one survivor\never returned. After the havens of the Falas were destroyed by FA 474,\nCírdan was instrumental in setting up the refuges at the Mouths of\nSirion and the Isle of Balar, to which he retired for the remainder of\nthe age. It was on this isle that he built the great ship Vingilot for\nEärendil.[2][3]\n\nSecond Age\n\nIn the Second Age, Círdan stayed behind when the Elves were summoned to\nValinor, and set up the havens of Forlond, Harlond and Mithlond in the\ndestroyed land of Lindon (anciently Ossiriand). Círdan's exact status\nduring that time is unknown, but it seems certain he served as\nlieutenant of Gil-galad, the last High King of the Ñoldor of\nMiddle-earth. Círdan is mentioned as receiving the ships of the\nNúmenóreans as they returned to the north of Middle-earth, and also as\nbeing one of the only two elves (along with Elrond) who stood beside\nGil-galad during his last battle with Sauron.\n\nThird Age\n\n[Círdan (centre) receives Narya]\n\nFrom the Third Age onwards, after the fall of Gil-galad and the\nbeginning of the Age of Men, Círdan remained at the Grey Havens of\nMithlond where he was lord, and built ships which ferried the departing\nElves to Valinor. Círdan had possession of the one of the Three Elven\nRings, Narya, but when the Wizards or Istari arrived in the early Third\nAge he recognised Olórin's wisdom, and gave him his ring.\n\nCírdan remained active behind the scenes, sending counsellors to the\nWhite Council at Rivendell, but following the War of the Ring he was\nseen to have prepared the ship that ferried across the other\nRing-bearers: Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Bilbo, and Frodo in the last\nyear of the Third Age. It is uncertain whether he left Middle-earth\nhimself on the same ship: he is not mentioned as boarding, and later\nletters by Tolkien imply he remained behind. There are contradictory\nreferences to the Fate of the Elves of Middle-earth scattered throughout\nTolkien's works, and it may be that Círdan's role as a facilitator for\nelves returning to the Blessed Realm continued for some time. There\nis one line that says that Círdan would remain until the last ship set\nsail for the west.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nCírdan had a beard, which was rare for Elves, and silver hair like\nThingol his overlord and kinsman. He was of great age at the time of the\nWar of the Ring: perhaps the oldest of the Telerin Elves or even of all\nthe elves remaining in Middle-earth. He may have been one of the elves\nwho awoke near Cuiviénen and therefore without a mother or father.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Círdan_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Ship-maker', and the Quenya\nform was said to be _CIRYATAN_. His original name was probably _NOWË_,\nwhich may be related to the term _nowo_ meaning “think, form idea,\nimagine.”",

However, other writings of Tolkien have more to say: In\nTolkien's _Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age_ we are told that\naside from Curunír (Saruman), Mithrandir (Gandalf), and Radagast, there\nwere “others of the Istari who went into the east of Middle-earth, and\ndo not come into these tales.” Tolkien also writes in _Unfinished\nTales_ that the two Wizards were sent to the East.

Húrin was left with a small garrison of men from the city in\norder to defend it should Sauron decided to bring more Haradrim up out\nof the south and assult it while the other captains rode towards Mordor.\nHúrin was aided in his defence of the city by Elfhelm, a marshal of\nRohan and some two thousand men of Rohan. Their numbers were further\nbolstered by a great number of men that arrived out of Gondor's southern\nlands, led by Angbor the Fearless, who was the Lord of Lamedon. Due to\nthis, the city under Húrin's stewardship was better manned that it had\nbeen before the Siege of Gondor had started.\n\nAfter the War\n\nBy the time the army of the west returned in victory to Minas Tirith,\nFaramir had returned to health and had resumed the title of steward, and\nHúrin was back to being the warden of the keys. Hurin went with Faramir\nto greet the returning army, and was one of the major witnesses to the\ncrowing of Aragorn, the new King of Gondor. In his role as warden of the\nkeys, it was Húrin who opened up the temporary barrier that was placed\nin front of the broken gate of Minas Tirith in order allow Aragorn and\nthe rest of the army to enter the city.\n\nNothing else is known of Húrin after this point, though presumably he\nretained his position within the city after Aragorn became king."

    "text": "GLAURUNG was the first terrestrial, fire-breathing Dragon in\nMiddle-earth. He is known as the Father of Dragons.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Years\n\nAfter suffering a number of defeats at the hands of the Ñoldor in\nBeleriand, Morgoth came to realize that his armies of Orcs were no match\nfor the Noldor unaided. As such, he began to experiment with ways to\ncreate new, deadlier creatures for use in his armies. Glaurung was the\nresult of these experiments. After a century of brooding and growing in\nthe dark pits of Angband, Glaurung first emerged in FA 260 and attacked\nthe Elves maintaining the Siege of Angband. Though Glaurung was not of\nthe winged race that would later arise, he was the greatest terror of\nhis time. He burned and ravaged Ard-galen, the land of the Elves in\nHithlum and Dorthonion. However, he was not yet at his full strength, so\nwas driven back by Fingon, the prince of Hithlum at that time, and his\narchers. Morgoth was displeased with Glaurung for revealing himself\nbefore he had grown to full strength, as Morgoth had planned for\nGlaurung's existence to be a complete surprise.\n\nTo Glaurung, this attack was merely a youthful testing of his strength.\nTerrible as he was to the Elves, the armor of his scales was still\nvulnerable to the bite of weapons. However, despite his untimely foray,\nMorgoth's plans were not disrupted.\n\nWar upon the Elves\n\nDagor Bragollach\n\nGlaurung was contained in Angband for another two centuries before he\nwas again loosed during the Fourth Battle of the Battles of Beleriand.\nKnown as the Dagor Bragollach for the fires unleashed by Morgoth from\nthe Iron Mountains, Glaurung in full power led Melkor's forces against\nthe High Elves of Beleriand. Now fully grown, none could withstand his\nmight, and with the Balrogs at his side, Glaurung led the Orcs to an\noverwhelming victory and broke the siege of Angband.\n\nNirnaeth Arnoediad\n\nIn the fifth battle, the\n\nNirnaeth Arnoediad, Glaurung caused even more destruction, as he had\nfathered a brood of lesser Dragons to follow him into battle. So a great\narmy of Elves and Men fell before the onslaught, for none could\nwithstand the Dragonfire save the Dwarves of Belegost, who had come to\nbattle a common foe.\n\nAfter the Elven and Edain armies had been broken, Morgoth used Glaurung\nto hold the territories he gained; but force in battle was not the only\npower the monster knew. He brought many under his sway with the binding\npower of his serpent eye and hypnotic Dragon Spell.\n\nThe Sack of Nargothrond\n\nAfter Glaurung aided Morgoth during the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, he\nwas given the assignment to complete the Sack of Nargothrond, one of the\nElven fortresses in Beleriand. Glaurung came upon Nargothrond with great\nforce, and sacked the kingdom easily. He faced Túrin, son of Húrin, at\nthe gate and so he froze Túrin with his eyes. Túrin heard the screams of\nFinduilas, daughter of Orodreth, as he stood there. When the captives\nhad been taken away, Glaurung unfroze Túrin and gave him two choices:\nthe first to follow Finduilas, and the second to aid his mother and\nsister, who were suffering in Dor-lómin. Túrin chose the latter, and in\nthis way he was deceived by the dragon, for his mother and sister were\nliving well in Doriath. Glaurung then gathered up all the treasures of\nFelagund and hoarded them deep within Nargothrond's underground halls,\nhe then sat atop his hoard, guarding it jealously, and so he rested.\n\nLast Years\n\nGlaurung received knowledge of Morwen and Nienor's departure to seek\ntheir family members. In the forest where they were travelling, Glaurung\nfound Nienor and caused her to lose her mind. This caused her to run\nthrough the forest “like a deer”. Soon after this, Túrin found her\ncrying on Finduilas's grave. Not knowing that she was his sister, Túrin\nnamed her Níniel (Tear maiden) and took her to his home with the folk of\nBrandir. There they lived for the next three years, during which they\nfell in love.\n\nDeath\n\nAfter those years, Glaurung attacked the area around their home. Túrin\nresolved to kill the dragon. Two men went with him. One became afraid\nand fled, and the other was crushed by rocks. However, Túrin was able to\nkill Glaurung by thrusting his sword, Gurthang, into Glaurung's belly.\nGlaurung felt his death wound and screamed. When the dragon's blood\ntouched Túrin, he fell into a swoon. Glaurung screamed until his\nstrength was gone. Nienor found him there, with Túrin beside him. With\nhis last breath, Glaurung gave Nienor her memory back, and died. Shortly\nthereafter, Nienor jumped into the river below, and Túrin awoke and\nthrew himself on his sword.\n\nEarliest version\n\nIn _The Book of Lost Tales II_, _Glorund_ was the early name of\nGlaurung.",

Correctly believing that the dwarves had received\nassistance from the men of Lake-town in entering the Lonely Mountain,\nSmaug left the mountain to wreak destruction upon Lake-town, nearly\ndecimating it before being slain by Bard the Bowman.\n\n\nBiography\n\nOrigins\n\nDetails of his origin are unknown (presumably bred in Angband in the\nlate First Age), but in TA 2770 he attacked the Lonely Mountain and the\ntown of Dale.\n\nThird Age\n\n[Smaug in the original illustration by J.R.R. Tolkien]\n\nIn TA 2770, Smaug came from the mountains in the north, drawn by great\nwealth amassed by the Dwarven kingdom of the Lonely Mountain, which\nincluded gold, gemstones, silver, pearls, the many-faceted crystals of\nemerald, sapphire and diamond, and the famed Arkenstone. He took the\nmountain, killing many dwarves inside it. Thrór and Thráin used the\nsecret door to escape, and the dragon continued ravaging the surrounding\ncountryside for a long time.\n\nFor two centuries, Smaug ruled the Lonely Mountain uncontested, lying\nwithin the great treasure hoard of the Lonely Mountain and ensuring that\nno one entered in an attempt to steal from him. The surrounding domain\nbecame a scarred wasteland known to the Dwarves and men as the\nDesolation of Smaug. Yet in the year TA 2941, a company of fourteen\nadventurers consisting of twelve Dwarves, the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, and\nled by the heir of the Lonely Mountain, Thorin Oakenshield, entered\nSmaug's mountain lair by a secret door in a daring attempt to reclaim\nthe ancient treasure from the dragon. \n\nBilbo, the company's appointed “burglar,” was sent into the treasure\nchamber alone in an attempt to stealthily gather information and steal\nwhat he can without waking Smaug. Once inside, Bilbo was surprised to\nfind that Smaug was much larger than he had expected and covered in\nimpenetrable armor, save for his underbelly. Aware of this\nvulnerability, Smaug deliberately had spent years sprawled on the wealth\nof his hoard, allowing diamonds and hard gemstones to be embedded into\nhis belly, armoring his only weakness. However, while examining the\ndragon, Bilbo noticed a single bare patch on the monster's left breast,\nnearest his heart. With this invaluable information, he escaped the\ndragon's lair and returned to the Dwarves, sharing his discovery of\nSmaug's weakness with them, unaware that he was overheard by a thrush,\nwho carried the secret to Bard the Bowman in nearby Esgaroth, the city\nknown as “Lake-town”.\n\n[Smaug's previous wound in his scales]\n\n[Smaug destroys Lake-town|250x250px|left]\n\nReturning to the treasure chamber, Bilbo attempted to steal a single\ncup, but its theft is immediately noticed by Smaug, who awakens from his\nslumber. Amused by the Hobbit, Smaug converses with Bilbo, attempting to\ndeduce his origins and purpose in the mountain. He quickly surmises that\nBilbo was aiding Thorin and the rest of the Dwarf company in an attempt\nto steal back the Arkenstone and reclaim the Mountain. Smaug flies into\na rage, erupting from the mountain in a fiery wrath and loosening his\nflame upon the land. He flies to Lake-town upon the Long Lake and\ndevastates it. In the midst of the wreck, Bard the Bowman, heir to the\nthrone of Dale, does his best to rally men to repel the dragon's\nassault. Bard, guided by his knowledge of Smaug's secret weakness, fires\na black arrow into the beast's vulnerable spot on his belly. Roaring in\nfury and pain, Smaug falls from the sky and crashes into the flaming\nruins of Lake-town, his death signaled the end of the presence of\ndragons in Middle Earth. \n\nAfter Death\n\n[Smaug's body falls upon burning Lake-town.|250x250px]\n\nAfter Smaug's death, Thorin and Company claimed the treasures of the\nLonely Mountain as theirs by birthright. This created a conflict with\nBard and the Elvenking Thranduil of Mirkwood, each of whom wanted a\nportion of the gold as reimbursement for all the damage Smaug had caused\nto their kingdoms over the years. Thorin refused to share the treasure\nand, as a result, they both declared war on him.\n\nIt is said that a vast fortune in gemstones lay with Smaug's rotting\ncarcass amongst the pilings of old Lake-town, but few had the courage to\ndive for them in later years. With no Dragon to contend with, the\nsurvivors of the town rebuilt on dry land next to the lake. Gandalf\nwould later note the good fortune of the dragon's destruction, as\notherwise Smaug might have proved a continual menace.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _SMAUG_ is derived from the past tense of the primitive\nGermanic verb _smugan_ (“to squeeze through a hole”).[1] The name is\nassociated with _smeag_ (as in Smeagol), which is a form of the Old\nEnglish _smygel_ (“to burrow”).[2]\n\nThe diphthong “au” in _Smaug_ is pronounced like the “ou” in _sound_ or\n_house_, though the name is often erroneously pronounced _Smog_, most\nnotably in the Rankin/Bass animated movie.\n\nIn Dalish, the language of Dale, the name of Smaug is _'Trāgu'_.[3] It\nis noted to be similar with to the Norwegian word for dragon, _drágë._'\n\nOther names\n\nDuring the conversation between Smaug and Bilbo, Bilbo calls him several\nnames and epithets, such as SMAUG THE:\n\n-   '''Magnificent '''\n-   TREMENDOUS\n-   UNASSESSABLY WEALTHY\n-   MIGHTY\n-   TERRIBLE\n-   STUPENDOUS\n-   TYRANNICAL\n-   CHIEFEST AND GREATEST OF CALAMITIES\n-   YOUR MAGNIFICENCE\n\n\nSize\n\nSmaug's actual size is unknown, as it is never explicitly mentioned in\nthe _The Hobbit_. In _The Atlas of Middle-earth_ by Karen Wynn Fonstad,\nSmaug is said to be about 20 meters (66 feet) in length. This\nmeasurement corresponds with drawings by Tolkien in which Smaug seems to\nbe around 25 meters (82 feet).\n\nIt is unclear whether Smaug, the largest specimen in the Third Age,\nwould compete in mightiness to his ancestors of average size in the\nFirst Age, though he was clearly smaller than Ancalagon, the largest\nknown dragon to have existed.\n\n\nAbilities\n\n[Smaug preparing to shoot fire at Bilbo]\n\nBeing a fully-grown dragon, Smaug was both massive and powerful,\npossessing physical strength capable of crushing stone with ease, as\nseen by his attack on the Lonely Mountain. He was able to fly thanks to\nhis large wings, and had the ability to breathe streams of searing hot\nflame from his mouth. Some comments in _The Hobbit_ imply that his\nentire body was imbued with fire, as he was seen to glow in the darkness\nof the Lonely Mountain's depths, and his usual paths were said to have\nbeen “smoothed and slimed” (i.e. melted) by his passage.\n\nLike many dragons of Middle-earth, Smaug's monstrous appearance also\nbelied keen senses and a dangerously sharp mind. He had an encyclopedic\nknowledge of his treasure hoard, immediately registering the theft of a\nsingle cup after Bilbo made his first visit to his lair. When the hobbit\nreturned a second time, Smaug was already expecting him by feigning\nsleep, and immediately declared that he could sense the thief even if he\ncould not see him. Although Bilbo was clever enough not to fall for\nSmaug's attempts to trick him into revealing his exact position, the\ndragon used the resulting conversation to plant doubts in Bilbo's mind,\ncorrectly guessing that the “burglar” had allied himself with the\nDwarves and the men of Lake Town and asking if Bilbo had ever considered\nthe logistical difficulties of getting his share of Smaug's treasure\nback to his home. Despite his size, Smaug is shown to be agile and\nquick, able to leap over objects with ease, and he can dive at very high\nspeeds with little effort.\n\n[Fire breath, as seen in the film]\n\nDefensively, Smaug's reddish-gold scales rendered him impervious to\nnearly all weapons, but his underbelly was relatively soft and\nvulnerable. To compensate for this, Smaug took to sleeping upon the\ngathered treasure of the Lonely Mountain, allowing bits of gold and\njewels to embed themselves in his body. This “diamond waistcoat” was\nintended to cover his only physical weak spot, but when Bilbo Baggins\nconfronted the dragon in his lair, he discovered a bare patch on the\nleft side of his chest. Bard was told this by an ancient thrush that\noverheard Bilbo relating this information to the Dwarves, enabling\nhim to defeat Smaug by shooting his Black Arrow into the bare patch.\n\n\nPersonality\n\nSmaug is portrayed as being psychopathic, extremely sadistic, confident,\nviolent, cruel, arrogant, intelligent and greedy, possessing an\nunquenchable desire for gold. His most distinguishing characteristic\n(aside from his greed) is his arrogance, as Smaug proudly boasts of his\nsuperiority and impregnability to Bilbo during their encounter. However,\nthis proves to be his downfall, as he unwittingly reveals the weak spot\nin his chest to Bilbo when showing the Hobbit how he had willfully\ncoated his underbelly in treasure to protect it.\n\nSmaug seems primarily motivated by personal greed rather than a desire\nto do evil, and does not seem to serve any allegiance other than his\nown. While he does ruthlessly destroy Dale and lays waste to the Dwarves\nof the Lonely Mountain during his attack on the Lonely Mountain, once he\nhas assumed dominion of the region he seems content to allow the rest of\nMiddle Earth to go about its business, so long as he or his treasure\nremains undisturbed; although this could be because he feels that the\npeople living in the region have nothing he wants. Highly intelligent,\nSmaug appears to possess a rather sardonic sense of humor, darkly\nmocking Bilbo while they converse within the Lonely Mountain's treasure\nchamber. Smaug seems to dislike Dwarves, considering them to be weak and\npathetic creatures far beneath him, making unfavorable comments\nabout Thror and showing no remorse over his slaughter of their kind and\nclaiming of their kingdom. While conversing with Bilbo, Smaug is also\nable to quickly surmise the reason for Bilbo's presence in Erebor, and\nalso correctly deduces that the Dwarves received aid from the men of\nEsgaroth in reaching the mountain.",
