    "text": "ADANEL was a wise woman from the House of Marach. She was a daughter of\nMalach and his wife, Zimrahin, and the older sister of Magor. It was\nmentioned that Adanel had many other brothers and sisters as well, and\nlike Magor her brother, they also might have been younger than she.\n\n\nBiography\n\nAdanel ended up marrying Belemir of the House of Bëor, a great-grandson\nof Bëor the Old himself. Adanel was the mother of five children and her\nfifth and last child was a son Beren. Adanel's son Beren later was\nthe grandfather of his great namesake grandson the renowned Beren\nErchamion (_Beren the One-handed_) of whom his daughter the famed\nEmeldir _the Man-hearted_ named after him. Thus, Adanel was the\ngreat-grandmother of Beren son of Emeldir, her granddaughter.\n\nThe Wise of the People of Marach were the only Men to preserve the tale\nof their original sin, when, soon after their awakening, the Men chose\nto worship Melkor instead of Eru. Adanel told this tale (called the\n'''Tale of Adanel '''in Morgoth's Ring) to Andreth of the House of Bëor.\n\nAndreth was a very distant niece of Adanel's husband Belemir through the\nline of Baran, the eldest son of Bëor, and Belemir through the line of\nhis grandfather Belen who was the youngest son of Bëor. In addition,\nAndreth's nephew Barahir married Adanel's granddaughter Emeldir.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Adanel_ was a Sindarin name of unclear meaning. It is likely\nto have come from the words _adan_, meaning 'man' (as a race, rather\nthan in gender), and _el_, meaning 'star'. This would give the meanings\n“star of man” or perhaps “man of the star” to her name."

He became the last of the\nruling Sindar over Lorien.\n\nAmroth and Nimrodel\n\nAmroth's beloved, a beautiful Elf Maiden named Nimrodel, regretted that\nElves from Beleriand, which was under assault by Morgoth, were being\nadmitted into Lothlórien. She believed that these foreign Elves brought\nwars and destroyed the peace that Lothlórien's inhabitants had once\nenjoyed. When a Balrog was awakened in Moria by the delvings of the\nDwarves and they fled north to the Grey Mountains, many of the Elves\nliving on the west side of Lórien moved inward, and the Galadhremmin\ntightened their guard. Nimrodel, living on the west side of the forest\nby the stream that afterward bore her name, preferring not to mix with\nthe Galadhremmin who she deemed invaders of the golden wood, instead\nfled to Fangorn Forest in TA 1981 (Third Age).

She lingered on the edge of the forest, unsure of\nwhat to do. Amroth found her there a day later.\n\nThere, Amroth and Nimrodel spoke long and earnestly with one another,\nAmroth begging for her favor. Eventually, the Elf-Maiden promised that\nshe would marry Amroth only if he brought her to a peaceful land.\n\nAmroth vowed that he would leave the Elves of Lothlórien, even if a time\ncame when they needed him most. However, none of Middle-earth was at\npeace and Amroth believed that the Elves would never enjoy peace again.\nHe suggested that he and Nimrodel should travel across the Sundering\nSeas to the Undying Lands.\n\nAmroth knew that the Sindarin Elves had come to the Bay of Belfalas, a\nhaven south of Lothlórien, long ago. Although the majority of those\nelves had left Middle-earth and sailed to the Undying Lands, Amroth was\naware that some of their kind still built ships and offered passage to\nany of the other elves wishing to leave Middle-earth. After Amroth made\nthe necessary arrangements, he and Nimrodel left Lothlórien.\n\nHowever, they somehow became separated on their journey. Amroth looked\nfor Nimrodel, but his search was unsuccessful so he continued south\ntowards the Sundering Seas.\n\nFate\n\nAt the havens on the Bay of Belfalas, Amroth found that the few\nremaining Sindarin Elves who remained in Middle-earth were preparing to\nleave aboard the only seaworthy ship that they had. Although they\nwelcomed Amroth aboard, they were unwilling to wait for Nimrodel. They\nhoped that she was in Gondor and that she had not attempted to cross the\nWhite Mountains, where many unfriendly Men and evil creatures lived.\n\nThe summer was almost over and it would soon be autumn, which was\nexpected to bring dangerously strong winds. However, the Elves saw that\nAmroth was extremely upset. They had removed all their possessions from\ntheir houses on the shore, so they waited with Amroth on their ship for\nmany weeks. Summer passed and autumn came, but Nimrodel still did not\narrive.\n\nOne night, one of the fiercest storms in the recorded history of Gondor\ncame from the Northern Wastes, swept through Eriador and caused an\nenormous amount of destruction to Gondor. Many of the ships that the Men\nof Gondor had built were swept away from the coast and sank. The wind\nbroke the light Elven-ship from its moorings and hurled the vessel far\nfrom the Bay of Belfalas, driving it towards the coasts of Umbar.\n\nAt dawn of the following morning, the storm dissipated. However, when\nAmroth awoke, he saw that the ship was already far from its port. Full\nof despair, Amroth screamed Nimrodel's name, threw himself into the\nwater below and drowned.\n\nThe ship was never seen again in Middle-earth, although it is likely\nthat the vessel left the Circles of the World and eventually reached Tol\nEressëa, an island that the Eldar used to enable them to complete the\nGreat Journey.\n\nNeither Elves nor Men ever saw Amroth or Nimrodel again, but there were\nmany legends concerning Nimrodel's fate.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe Elf Maiden shared her name with a stream where she once lived, which\nindirectly flowed into the Bay of Belfalas. According to Elven legend,\nAmroth's voice continued to emanate from the sea and Nimrodel's voice\noften resonated from the stream that shared her name.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Amroth_ means “upclimber” or “high climber”, from _am_ (“high, going\nup”). It refers to his having built and dwelt in a flet high in the\ntrees on Cerin Amroth. The name was of Lemberin language (later\n“Avarin”), along with other Sindarin names such as _Legolas_,\n_Nimrodel_, and _Thranduil_.\n\n\nAmroth in Song\n\nLegolas sang an extract from a long and sad song to Frodo Baggins by the\nbanks of the Nimrodel. The song, which depicted the story of Amroth and\nNimrodel, was sometimes sung in Rivendell.\n\n An Elven-maid there was of old, A shining star by day: Her mantle white\nwas hemmed with gold, Her shoes of silver-grey.\n\nA star was bound upon her brows, A light was on her hair As sun upon the\ngolden boughs In Lórien the fair.\n\nHer hair was long, her limbs were white, And fair she was and free; And\nin the wind she went as light As leaf of linden-tree.\n\nBeside the falls of Nimrodel, By water clear and cool, Her voice as\nfalling silver fell Into the shining pool.\n\nWhere now she wanders none can tell, In sunlight or in shade; For lost\nof yore was Nimrodel And in the mountains strayed.\n\nThe elven-ship in haven grey Beneath the mountain-lee Awaited her for\nmany a day Beside the roaring sea.\n\nA wind by night in Northern lands Arose, and loud it cried, And drove\nthe ship from elven-strands Across the streaming tide.\n\nWhen dawn came dim the land was lost, The mountains sinking grey Beyond\nthe heaving waves that tossed Their plumes of blinding spray.\n\nAmroth beheld the fading shore Now low beyond the swell, And cursed the\nfaithless ship that bore Him far from Nimrodel.\n\nOf old he was an Elven-king, A lord of tree and glen, When golden were\nthe boughs in spring In fair Lothlórien.\n\nFrom helm to sea they saw him leap, As arrow from the string, And dive\ninto the water deep, As mew upon the wing.\n\nThe wind was in his flowing hair, The foam about him shone; Afar they\nsaw him strong and fair Go riding like a swan.\n\nBut from the West has come no word, And on the Hither Shore No tidings\nElven-folk have heard Of Amroth evermore.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nAmroth was briefly the son of Galadriel and Celeborn, brother of\nCelebrían. In this version, he lived in Eregion and fled with Galadriel\nand Celebrían between TA 1350 and TA 1400.\n\nHe was called as Ammalas in earlier writings, and was the lover of\nInglorel (Nimrodel)."

Of all the Kings of Númenor, he wielded the\nmost power, but used it most unwisely; his desire for more eternal life\ncaused the destruction of Númenor and the Change of the World.\n\n\nBiography\n\nAr-Pharazôn was the son of Gimilkhâd, the leader of the King's Men\nduring the reign of Tar-Palantir of Númenor. Ar-Pharazôn grew into a Man\nof great strength, stature, and will, not unlike the ancient heroes of\nthe Edain. In these earlier days, he was good friends with Amandil, the\nfuture Lord of Andúnië and his line of people. However, he was his\nfather's child and thus was instructed to follow in the ways of the\nKing's Men.\n\nAr-Pharazôn became a man of great pride and was eager for more wealth\nand glory. He grew restless in his homeland and was often abroad leading\nlike-minded Númenóreans in the wars that they were waging against the\nmen of Middle-earth. In this he fared well on both land and sea for he\nwon great wealth, and gained great respect as a captain. When he finally\nreturned home, the people rejoiced in him and he was very popular and\ngenerous with the wealth and fortunes he won in Middle-earth.\n\nUpon the death of his uncle, Tar-Palantir, who had no son, Ar-Pharazôn\ndecided to wed his daughter, Míriel, which was against her will. As\nTar-Míriel was the rightful Ruling Queen of Númenor, Ar-Pharazôn was\nable to usurp the throne. He gave to his wife the name Ar-Zimraphel,\nrefusing to use the Elven speech, whilst persecuting the last vestiges\nof the Faithful.\n\nAs time passed, it came to his attention that Sauron, the Lord of\nMordor, was expanding his power throughout Middle-earth and was being\ncalled the Lord of Men. Ar-Pharazôn, ever prideful, resolved to\nchallenge him lordship of the earth. In SA 3261, he marched upon Mordor\nwith an army so powerful that Sauron's forces simply deserted him. But\nSauron was cunning, and he feigned to be overawed at Ar-Pharazôn's\nmight. However, Ar-Pharazôn did not trust Sauron, and brought him back\nto Númenor as a hostage. However, Sauron quickly took advantage of his\nsituation to gain Ar-Pharazôn's trust, and by way of careful flattery,\nlies and half-truths, he soon became the king's closest and most trusted\nadvisor. He was able to corrupt Ar-Pharazôn, convincing him to worship\nMorgoth in the hope that he would be able to cheat mortality. Some of\nthe results of Sauron's cunning were the erecting of a Great Temple to\nMorgoth, intense persecution of the Faithful, and the chopping down of\nthe White Tree of Númenor. Soon the king and his followers were\nworshiping Morgoth openly and burning innocents at the altar of the\ntemple as sacrificial offerings to appease the false god.\n\nThen, as Ar-Pharazôn felt the bite of old age upon him, Sauron was able\nto convince him to attack Valinor and claim the right to immortality by\nforce. He began the building of a huge fleet, the Great Armament, to\nattack Valinor in SA 3310 and finally broke the Ban of the Valar,\nlanding on the shores of the Undying Lands in SA 3319. The Valar then\nlaid down their guardianship of the world and called upon Eru, the One.\nHe sank Ar-Pharazôn's fleet and all of Númenor beneath the ocean,\nchanging the shape of the world. Valinor was no longer connected to\nMiddle-earth, and mortals could no longer find it. Afterwards, only\nelves and a few remarkable exceptions could reach it following the\nStraight Road into the far west. Ar-Pharazôn and his mighty host who\nlanded on Aman were buried by mounds of dirt and remain in the Caves of\nthe Forgotten until the last battle, or Dagor Dagorath. He and his great\narmy's role in the end of days has not been made clear.\n\n\nLegacy and successors\n\nAr-Pharazôn's tyrannical rule and rebellious resolve to break the Ban of\nthe Valar and make war upon the west led to the end of the royal\nNúmenórean line. Instead, the line of Elros was continued from the long\nline of the Lords of Andúnië. As Amandil of Andúnië did not return from\nhis venture into the west, his son Elendil became the successor of a new\nkingdom that would rule from Middle-earth in exile. His two surviving\nsons, Isildur and Anárion followed him into exile and would in turn\nbecome his successors as well.\n\nAr-Pharazôn was remembered by the surviving Númenorean lineage with a\nsort of grudging respect. Despite his errors, he was the first and last\nHuman capable to beat and humiliate the powerful dark lord Sauron by\nhimself. In remembrance to this feat, in Umbar was erected a monument to\nthe Golden King of Númenor: a dark crystal globe, on a tall white\ncolumn, which absorbed sunrays and glimmered in the night for everyone\nto see. The monument was destroyed when Umbar corsairs swore allegiance\nto Sauron.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis chosen royal name of _Pharazôn_ which means “GOLDEN” was in Adûnaic;\nhis name in Quenya was _Tar-Calion_ with _Calion_ meaning “SON OF\nLIGHT”."

He was a great ranger\nand warrior, and as Isildur's heir he bore the shards of Narsil,\nreforged and renamed _Andúril_, in the War of the Ring.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly years\n\n\n\nAragorn was a descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur. His ancestor Arvedui was\nwedded to Fíriel, who was descended from Anárion, who bore their son\nAranarth, making Aragorn the last descendant of Anárion as well.\n\nWhen he was only two years old, his father Arathorn was killed while\npursuing orcs. Aragorn was afterwards fostered in Rivendell by Elrond.\nAt the request of his mother, his lineage was kept secret, as she feared\nhe would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity\nas the descendant of Elendil and Heir of Isildur became known. Aragorn\nwas renamed _ESTEL_ and was not told about his heritage until 2951.\n\n\n\nElrond revealed to “Estel” his true name and ancestry when he was\ntwenty, and gave to him the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil.\nElrond withheld the Sceptre of Annúminas from Aragorn until he “came of\nthe right” to possess the item. It was also around this time that\nAragorn met and fell in love with Arwen, Elrond's daughter, newly\nreturned from her mother's homeland of Lórien where she had visited her\ngrandmother Galadriel.\n\nAragorn thereafter assumed his proper role as the sixteenth Chieftain of\nthe Dúnedain and the Rangers of the North, and left the comforts of\nRivendell for the wild, where he lived with the remainder of his people,\nwhose kingdom had been destroyed through civil and regional wars\ncenturies before.\n\nAragorn met Gandalf the Grey in 2956 and they became close friends.\nHeeding Gandalf's advice, Aragorn and the Rangers began to guard a small\nland known as the Shire inhabited by the diminutive and agrarian\nHobbits, and he became known among the peoples just outside the Shire's\nborders as STRIDER.\n\nFrom TA 2957 to TA 2980, Aragorn undertook great journeys, serving in\nthe armies of King Thengel of Rohan, and Steward Ecthelion II of Gondor.\nMany of his tasks helped to raise morale in the West and counter the\ngrowing threat of Sauron and his allies, and he earned priceless\nexperience which he would later put to use in the War of the Ring.\nAragorn served his lords in disguise and his name in Gondor and Rohan\nduring that time was THORONGIL (“Eagle of the Star”). With a small\nGondor squadron of ships, he led an assault on the long-standing rebel\nprovince of Umbar in 2980, burning many of the Corsairs' ships and\npersonally slaying their lord during the battle on the Havens. After the\nvictory at Umbar, “Thorongil” left the field and, to the dismay of his\nmen, went east.\n\n\n\nLater in 2980, he visited Lórien, and there once again met Arwen. He\ngave her the heirloom of his House, the Ring of Barahir, and, on the\nhill of Cerin Amroth, Arwen pledged her hand to him in marriage,\nrenouncing her elvish lineage and accepting the Gift of Men: death.\n\nElrond withheld from Aragorn permission to marry his daughter until such\na time as his foster son should be king of _both_ Gondor and Arnor. As\nboth Elrond and Aragorn knew, to marry a mortal, Arwen would be required\nto choose mortality, and thus deprive the deathless Elrond of his\ndaughter while the world lasted. Elrond was also concerned for Arwen's\nown happiness, fearing that in the end she might find death (her own and\nthat of her beloved) too difficult to bear.\n\nBefore the events of _The Lord of the Rings_ properly take place,\nAragorn also traveled through the Dwarven mines of Moria, to Harad,\nwhere (in his own words) “the stars are strange.” Tolkien does not\nspecify when these travels occurred nor does he indicate what happens\nwhen Aragorn visits.\n\nIn 3009, Gandalf grew suspicious of the origin of the ring belonging to\nthe Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, which later turned out to be the One Ring, the\nsource of the Dark Lord Sauron's evil power. Aragorn went at his request\ninto Rhovanion in search of Gollum, who had once possessed the Ring. He\ncaught the creature in the Dead Marshes near Mordor, and brought him as\na captive to Thranduil's halls in Mirkwood, where Gandalf questioned\nhim.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nAragorn joined Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's adopted heir, and three of his\nfriends at the Inn of the Prancing Pony in Bree. Though originally\nthe hobbits were suspicious of Strider, they eventually trusted him and\nprepared to escape Bree and the Ringwraiths. These four had set out\nfrom the Shire to bring the One Ring to Rivendell. Aragorn was aged 87\nat that time, nearing the prime of life for one of royal Númenórean\ndescent. With Aragorn's help, the Hobbits escaped the pursuing\nNazgûl. The elf-lord Glorfindel later arrived and led them to\nRivendell.\n\nThere, Aragorn chose to join Frodo, thus forming the Fellowship of the\nRing that was formed to guard Frodo, tasked with destroying the Ring in\nthe fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. Besides Aragorn, Gandalf, and Frodo,\nthe company included  Frodo's cousins Pippin and Merry, his best friend Samwise Gamgee,\nLegolas the elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and Boromir of Gondor.\n\n All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost;\nThe old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by\nthe frost. From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the\nshadows shall spring; Renewed shall be Blade that was Broken, The\ncrownless again shall be king.\n\n    — Bilbo's poem about Aragorn\n\nBefore the group set out, the shards of Narsil were reforged, and the\nrestored blade was named Andúril.\n\nAragorn accompanied the group through an attempt to cross the pass of\nCaradhras and through the mines of Moria. He helped protect Frodo from\nan Orc captain and became group leader after Gandalf was presumed lost\nin battle with a Balrog. Aragorn led the company to Lórien, where\nLady Galadriel gave him the Elessar.\n\nAfter Lórien, Aragorn and the Fellowship sailed down the river Anduin to\nthe Falls of Rauros. Though his original plan was to set out for Gondor\nand aid its people in the War, he felt responsible for Frodo after the\nloss of Gandalf.\n\n\n\nAfter passing into the Argonath, the Fellowship camped in Amon Hen.\nFrodo saw that Boromir had been driven mad by the influence of the One\nRing trying to take it. Frodo put the ring on, rendering him invisible,\nand ran away from Boromir. Frodo climbed to the high seat on Amon Hen;\nfrom there he could see Sauron's eye looking for him. The Hobbit felt\nthe eye but it was distracted by Gandalf the White later found in\nFangorn Forest by (Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli looking for Merry and\nPippin.) Frodo would struggle against the power of Sauron, finally\ntaking the ring off. Then Frodo knew what had to be done: He was to go\nalone to Mordor to destroy the ring. On the way back to the river he\nmeets Sam, who goes with him.\n\n\n\nAt this same time, the others were attacked by Saruman's Uruk-hai and a\nbattle ensued. During the ensuing battle, Boromir was killed defending\nMerry and Pippin and giving up his desire for the ring in a last attempt\nto resist the ring. After discovering that Frodo had left, Aragorn and\nthe others decided that they would leave Frodo and Sam to continue their\nquest on their own. Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn put Boromir's body and\nwar gear in one of the elven boats as a funeral boat and tribute to\nBoromir for his bravery and courage. His body would be sent to the Falls\nof Rauros.\n\nWhile Frodo continued his quest with Samwise Gamgee, Aragorn, Legolas\nand Gimli went to Rohan to free Merry and Pippin, who had been captured\nby the Uruk-hai working for Saruman.\n\nThe Three Hunters\n\n\n\nIn the fields of Rohan, the Three Hunters Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli\nencountered Éomer, who had recently been pursuing rumours of an orc raid\nin the area. From Éomer, Aragorn learned that the Orcs who had kidnapped\nMerry and Pippin had been destroyed and that the Hobbits had not been\nfound. Dejected, he led Legolas and Gimli to the site of the battle.\nClues led Aragorn to believe that the Hobbits might still be alive, and\nhe led the Three Hunters into Fangorn Forest. They did not find the\nHobbits, but they did find Gandalf the White, sent back from Valinor to\ncontinue his struggle against Sauron. Gandalf told the Three Hunters\nthat the Hobbits were safe with the Ents of Fangorn.\n\n Where now are the Dunedain, Elessar, Elessar? Where do thy kinsfolk\nwander afar? Near is the hour when the lost should come forth, And the\nGrey Company ride from the North. But dark is the path appointed to\nthee: The Dead watch the road that leads to the Sea.\n\n    - Galadriel's message to Aragorn\n\nTogether, Gandalf and the Three Hunters travelled to Edoras, where\nGandalf freed Théoden from Saruman's enchantment and helped him organize\nthe Rohirrim against Saruman. He allied with Théoden and led the\nrefugees to Helm's Deep.\n\n\n\nAragorn, Legolas and Gimli then help the people of Rohan in the Battle\nof the Hornburg, in which they conclusively and victoriously defeated\nSaruman's army.Afterward Aragorn went with Gandalf to Isengard only\nto find Isengard in ruins by the work of the Ents. Aragorn, being\npresent with Gandalf, Theoden, Éomer, Legolas and Gimli, negotiate in a\nfinal parley with Saruman. Saruman at first tries to bend Theoden to his\nwill and at first Theoden is almost swayed but then he masters his will\nand refuses to join with Saruman. Saruman then sneers at Theoden and\nturns his attention to Gandalf and tries to sway him, only to be laughed\nat. Then Gandalf offers him a chance of repentance without limits.\nSaruman turns white in his face at this, sadly in the end however\nSaruman refuses to repent out of pride and to leave Orthanc. Gandalf\nbreaks Saruman's staff as he is no longer the head and is banished from\nthe Order of Wizards and The White Council. After Saruman crawls away,\nGrima Wormtongue then throws the Palantír of Orthanc at Gandalf as he\nand the others are leaving the Orthanc tower. But misses not being able\nto decide who he hated more Gandalf or Saruman. Thus ending the Battle\nof the Hornburg and the Battle of Isengard.\n\nReturn of the King\n\n\n\nIn order to defend the city, Aragorn travelled the Paths of the Dead,\nand summoned the Dead Men of Dunharrow who owed allegiance to the King\nof Gondor. It had been prophesied by Isildur and Malbeth the Seer that\nthe Dead would be summoned once more to pay their debt for betraying\nGondor a millennia before. With their aid the Corsairs of Umbar were\ndefeated.\n\nAragorn, a small force of Rangers, and a large contingent of men and\nsoldiers from the southern regions then sailed up the Anduin to Minas\nTirith. When they arrived at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Aragorn\nunfurled a standard that Arwen had made for him which showed both the\nWhite Tree of Gondor along with the jeweled crown and seven stars of the\nHouse of Elendil. With the help of the southern forces the armies of\nGondor and Rohan rallied together and defeated Sauron's army.\n\nThe Steward Denethor II declared that he would not bow to a descendant\nof Isildur (years before, he had seen “Thorongil” as a rival to his\nfather's favor). Aragorn healed Faramir, Denethor's last heir, winning\nhim the immediate recognition of Faramir as rightful heir to the throne;\nhis humility and self-sacrifice gained him the hearts of the inhabitants\nof Gondor's capital city. Aragorn's healing abilities, moreover, were a\nsign to the people of Gondor of the identity of their true king; as\nIoreth said, _“The hands of the King are the hands of a healer, and so\nshall the rightful king be known.”_ The people hailed him as King that\nsame evening.\n\nDespite his immediate success and popularity, however, and despite his\nclaim to the throne through raising the royal banner, Aragorn decided to\nlay aside his claim for the time being. He knew that if he aggressively\npromoted his claim, rival claimants or debates as to his legitimacy were\nnot out of the question, and this could be a fatal distraction for\nGondor at a time when the West needed to be united against Sauron. So,\nto avoid conflict, after he had healed people during the following\nnights of March 15–16, he left Minas Tirith and symbolically refused to\nenter it again until he was crowned King on May first.\n\nAs Reunited King of Gondor and Arnor\n\n\n\nUpon Sauron's defeat, Aragorn was crowned as KING ELESSAR, a name given\nto him by Galadriel. He became the TWENTY-SIXTH KING OF ARNOR,\nTHIRTY-FIFTH KING OF GONDOR and the first HIGH KING OF THE REUNITED\nKINGDOM, though it would be several years before his authority was\nfirmly reestablished in Arnor. His line was referred to as the House of\nTelcontar (Telcontar being Quenya for “Strider”). Aragorn married Arwen\nshortly afterwards, and ruled the Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor until 120\nof the Fourth Age. His reign was marked by great harmony and prosperity\nwithin Gondor and Arnor, and by a great renewal of cooperation and\ncommunication among Men, Elves, and Dwarves, fostered by his vigorous\nrebuilding campaign following the war. Aragorn led the forces of the\nReunited Kingdom on military campaigns against some Easterlings and\nHaradrim, re-establishing rule over much territory that Gondor had lost\nin previous centuries.\nDuring his coronation, Aragorn sang Elendil's Oath: _“Et Eärello\nEndorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta!”_\n(“Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. In this place I will\nabide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.”)\n\nDeath and End of Reign\n\n\n\nWhen in the year 120 of the Fourth Age, King Elessar realised his days\nwere at an end, he went to the House of the Kings in the Silent Street.\nHe said farewell to his son Eldarion and his daughters and gave Eldarion\nhis crown and sceptre. Arwen remained at Aragorn's side until he died.\nShortly a year after Aragorn died, Arwen soon died of a broken heart.\nEldarion began his reign as the Second King of the Reunited Kingdom\nafter his father's and mother's death.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nTolkien gives a brief but detailed description of him in _The Lord of\nthe Rings_: lean, dark, tall, with “a shaggy head of dark hair flecked\nwith grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keen grey eyes.”\n\nIn _The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen_, he was said to be often grim and\nsad, with unexpected moments of levity. Some time after the\npublications of the books, Tolkien wrote that he was six feet six inches\ntall.\n\nAragorn possessed Elven wisdom due to his childhood in Rivendell with\nElrond and the foresight of the Dúnedain. He was also a skilled healer,\nnotably with the plant _Athelas_ (also known as Kingsfoil). He was also\na mighty warrior and an unmatched commander; after the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields, he, Éomer, and Imrahil were said to be left unscathed,\neven though they had been in the thick of the fighting.\n\nThough there is no indication of his ever doubting his role and destiny\nas the future king of the Reunited Kingdom and one of the leaders of the\nwar against Sauron (as he did in Peter Jackson's film), he was not\nimmune to self-doubt, as he doubted the wisdom of his decisions while\nleading the Fellowship after the loss of Gandalf in Moria, and blamed\nhimself for many of their subsequent misfortunes.\n\nOn one occasion, his pride (or reverence for his heritage) led to\ncomplications, as he refused to disarm and leave his sword Andúril (a\npriceless heirloom of Númenor and one of the weapons which slew Sauron)\nat the door of Edoras, as Théoden had required, and only did so after\nGandalf left his own sword (also of high lineage) behind. Even so, he\nswore that death would come to anyone else who touched it (whether by\nhis own hand or by some magic, it is left unsaid).\n\nHe also appeared to possess a nigh-indomidable will. At one point, he\nwas able to psychically challenge Sauron for control of the Palantir of\nOrthanc, and proved victorious in that struggle. It should be noted that\neven Gandalf the White was reluctant to use the Palantir for fear of\nchallenging Sauron directly and revealing himself to the Dark Lord. He\nwas accounted as “the hardiest of living Men” during his lifetime.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _ARAGORN_ means “Revered King”, from the Sindarin _ara_\n(“king”) and _(n)gorn_ (“revered”).. Aragorn was named after Aragorn\nI.\n\nOther names\n\n-   ELESSAR - Aragorn's name as king (Quenya)\n-   EDHELHARN - Sindarin translation of Elessar\n-   ELFSTONE - Westron translation of Elessar\n-   ESTEL - Aragorn's nickname during his childhood in Rivendell. It\n    means “Hope”\n-   LONGSHANKS - Used by Samwise Gamgee and some of the Men of Bree\n-   STICK-AT-NAUGHT STRIDER - Used by the Men of Bree, particularly Bill\n    Ferny \n-   STRIDER - Used by the Men of Bree\n-   TELCONTAR - Quenya translation of Strider and the name of his House\n-   THORONGIL - Aragorn's alias during his travels to Rohan and Gondor.\n    It means “Eagle of the Star”\n-   WINGFOOT - Given by Éomer\n\nTitles\n\nAs king, Aragorn had many titles:\n\n-   THE DÚNADAN\n-   CHIEFTAIN OF THE DÚNEDAIN\n-   HEIR OF ISILDUR\n-   KING OF ALL THE DÚNEDAIN\n-   KING OF THE WEST\n-   LORD OF THE DÚNEDAIN\n-   ENVINYATAR - “the Renewer”\n-   KING OF GONDOR\n-   KING OF ARNOR\n-   HIGH KING OF GONDOR AND ARNOR\n-   LORD OF THE HOUSE OF TELCONTAR\n\n\nWeapons\n\n\n\nAs a Ranger, Aragorn was trained to be proficient with various weapons,\nsuch as bows, knives, spears and swords In battle he focused primarily\non his sword play, preferring close combat to a long scale fight. He was\na mighty warrior, and as such easily defeated many types of foes,\nranging from large groups of orcs to far more powerful foes such as\nTrolls and Ringwraiths, evident throughout various battles like Helm's\nDeep and the Morannon. In each case, Aragorn's finesse in battle has\nserved him greatly and earned him much recognition and respect from both\nthe Fellowship of the Ring and the people of Rohan and Gondor. He was\narguably the greatest swordsman of the Third Age, surpassing the likes\nof Faramir, Boromir and perhaps even Elrond.\n\nAragorn's sword is Andúril, Flame of the West, the reforged sword\nNarsil, Elendil's blade that Isildur used to cut the One Ring from\nSauron's hand. Aragorn uses it with the same skill the Numenoreans had\nlong ago.\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nThe restoration of the line of Elendil to the throne of Gondor is a\nsubplot of _The Lord of the Rings_; Aragorn's adventures not only aid\nFrodo in his Quest, but also bring him closer to his own kingship which,\nthough his by right and lineage, has been left open for centuries due to\nhistorical, legal, and military circumstances. The people of Gondor have\nbeen under the rule of the Stewards of Gondor for centuries, as it was\nwidely doubted that any of the royal line still lived. Shortly after\nIsildur's departure, Meneldil, son of Anárion, had severed Gondor from\nArnor politically, although the formal title of High King remained with\nthe northern line (as Isildur was Elendil's eldest son). This\narrangement had been reinforced by the Steward Pelendur in nearly 2,000\nyears before when he rejected Arvedui's claim to the Throne of Gondor\nduring a Gondorian succession crisis (Eärnil, a member of the House of\nAnárion, was eventually chosen as King instead). It is worth noting,\nhowever, that Arvedui had also based his claim on the fact that he had\nmarried a descendant of Anárion: thus, Aragorn was technically a\ndescendant of not only Elendil and Isildur but of Anárion as well.\n\n\nConcept and creation\n\nIdentity\n\nThe “first term” of the character that later evolved into Aragorn or\nStrider was a peculiar hobbit met by Bingo Bolger-Baggins (precursor of\nFrodo Baggins) at the inn of The Prancing Pony. His description and\nbehavior, however, was already quite close to the final story, with the\ndifference that the hobbit wore wooden shoes, and was nicknamed Trotter\nfor the “clitter-clap” sound that they produced. He was also accounted\nto be “one of the wild folk — rangers”, and he played the same role in\nFrodo's journey to Rivendell as in _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\nLater Tolkien hesitated about the true identity of “Trotter” for a long\ntime. One of his notes suggested that the Rangers should not be hobbits\nas originally planned, and that this would mean that Trotter was either\na Man, or a hobbit who associated himself with the Rangers and was “very\nwell known” (within the story). The latter suggestion was linked to an\nearly comment of Bingo: “I keep on feeling that I have seen him\nsomewhere before”. Tolkien made a proposal that Trotter might be Bilbo\nBaggins himself, but rejected that idea.\n\nAnother suggestion was that Trotter was “Fosco Took (Bilbo's first\ncousin), who vanished when a lad, owing to Gandalf”. This story was\nfurther elaborated, making Trotter a nephew of Bilbo, named Peregrin\nBoffin, and an elder cousin of Frodo. He was said to have run away after\nhe came of age, some twenty years before Bilbo's party, and had helped\nGandalf in tracking Gollum later. A hint was also given as to why\nTrotter wore wooden shoes: he had been captured by the Dark Lord in\nMordor and tortured, but saved by Gandalf; a note was added by Tolkien\nin the margin, saying that it would later be revealed that Trotter had\nwooden feet.\n\nThe conception of Trotter being a hobbit was discarded with the\nfollowing recommencing of writing; another short-lived idea was to make\nTrotter “a disguised elf − friend of Bilbo's in Rivendell”, and a scout\nfrom Rivendell who “pretends to be a ranger”.\n\nQuite soon Tolkien finally settled on the Mannish identity of Trotter,\nfrom the beginning introducing him as a “descendant of the ancient men\nof the North, and one of Elrond's household”, as well as the name\nAragorn. While the history of Númenor and the descendants of Elros and\nElendil were not fully developed, the terms of it were in existence, and\nwould come to be connected with The Lord of the Rings as the character\nof Aragorn developed. Thus the evolution of the history of the Second\nand Third Ages was dependent on the bringing of Trotter to association\nwith them.\n\nFurther character developments\n\nThe development of Aragorn's connection to Gondor was long and complex,\nas was his association with Boromir. Initially it is said that Aragorn's\nforefathers were the exiles of Númenor who ruled over the people of Ond\n(early name of Gondor), but were driven out by the Wizard King “when\nSauron raised a rebellion”. The story of the two branches of Elendil's\ndescendants ruling over two kingdoms of Men through many generations\nonly emerged gradually; at one time, Tolkien even seems to have\nconceived only three generations between Isildur and Aragorn.\n\nOne significant feature which was not established until late stages was\nAragorn's relationship with Arwen. When Tolkien first introduced Éowyn,\nthe interest which she showed towards Aragorn was not one-sided, with\nsuggestions in notes that they would marry at the end of the story.\nAnother proposal was done soon, that Éowyn would die to save or avenge\nThéoden, and Aragorn would never marry after her death.\n\nThe first mention of Elrond's daughter, named Arwen Undomiel, was in\nreference to the banner which she made for Aragorn, but Tolkien did not\ngive any hint whether she had any further part to play. The references\nto her marriage with Aragorn were made later, but it was explicitly\nstated only near the completion of the book. It is only in his working\non the appendices for The Lord of the Rings that Tolkien recorded the\nfull tale of Aragorn and Arwen.\n\nA passing idea was that Galadriel gave her Ring to Aragorn, and that he\nwould accordingly be titled the “Lord of the Ring”.\n\nRejected names\n\nThe original nickname TROTTER was retained for a long while, and Tolkien\ndecided to change it to Strider only after the story was completed.\nThere were also several experimental translations of Trotter to\nSindarin: Padathir, Du-finnion and Rimbedir, with Ecthelion possibly\nbeing equivalent to Peregrin (Boffin). Instead of the latter title “the\nDúnadan”, Quenya Tarkil (“Noble Man”) was first used, synonym with\nNúmenórean.\n\nTolkien hesitated for some time about Trotter's “real” name. Although\nAragorn was the first suggestion when the Mannish descent was settled,\nit was changed a number of times. At one point Tolkien decided that an\nElvish name does not suit a Man, and thus altered it from Aragorn via\nElfstone to Ingold, where the last one is an Old English name with ing-\nrepresenting “west”. Later, however, a new plot element was introduced:\nGaladriel's gift of a green stone, and Tolkien reverted the usage to\nElfstone in order to make an additional connection. This was retained\ninto the final version of the legendarium as a side name and a\ntranslation of Elessar.\n\nAmong other names to be used instead of Elfstone Tolkien considered\nElfstan, Elfmere, Elf-friend, Elfspear, Elfwold and Erkenbrand, with\nvarious Elvish forms: Eldamir, Eldavel, Eledon, and Qendemir. The name\nof Aragorn's father also passed through many transient forms: Tolkien\nintended Aramir or Celegorn to go in pair with Aragorn before settling\nupon Arathorn; Elfhelm and Eldakar with Elfstone and Eldamir; and Ingrim\nwith Ingold.\n\n\nHistory and Mythology\n\nRichard J. Finn presented a paper entitled “Arthur and Aragorn -\nArthurian Influence in LOTR at the Forty-First International Congress on\nMedieval Studies”. The are additional similarities between Aragorn and\nArthur beyond those pointed out by Finn. Arthur is descended from Kings\nof Goddodin - Coel Hen, Aragorn becomes King of Gondor. Kings of the\nperiod in Goddodin lived at both Traprain Law and Din Eidyn (Edinburgh,\nstill known as _Dùn Éideann_ in Scottish Gaelic) remarkably similar to\nDúnadan. For “Men of the North”, Goddodin was a far northern kingdom.\nArthur was crowned by St. Dubriticus, who wore a long gray robe for\nwhich he was called “His Grey Eminence” - Gandalf the White also wore a\ngray robe at Aragorn's coronation to indicate he at one time was Gandalf\nthe Grey.\n\n\nAppearance in the books and films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n-   _The Silmarillion_ (Mentioned only)\n\nIn the films\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_ (2001)\n-   _The Two Towers_ (2002)\n-   _The Return of the King_ (2003)\n-   _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_ (2014) (Mentioned only)\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nLord of the Rings film trilogy\n\n\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings_ movie trilogy (2001 – 2003) directed by Peter\nJackson, Aragorn is played by Danish-American actor Viggo Mortensen, who\ntook over the role from Stuart Townsend after a month of rehearsals. In\nthese movies, Aragorn must overcome his self-doubt to claim the\nkingship. This specific element of self-doubt is not present in\nTolkien's books, where Aragorn intends to claim the throne all\nalong. Daniel Day-Lewis was offered the role, but declined.\n\nIn order to ensure safe passage across Mordor for Frodo to fulfill his\nquest, Aragorn then led the Army of the West out from Minas Tirith to\nmake a diversionary feint on the Black Gate of Mordor itself in\nthe Battle of the Morannon. Gandalf had been given supreme command of\nthe war effort after the Pelennor Fields, and acted as chief spokesman\nin the parley with the Mouth of Sauron; but Aragorn commanded the Allied\ntroops during the battle and its aftermath.\n\nNon-Canonical weapons\n\nIn the film adaptation, Aragorn never carries the shards of Narsil as he\ndid in the books, and only receives the reforged Andúril before entering\nthe Paths of the Dead. Up until this time, Aragorn uses a different,\nmore basic sword that is never given a name. Attached to the scabbard of\nthis sword is a small utility knife that Aragorn uses in the wild\ncountry.\n\n-   Dagger\n\n\n\nAragorn also uses a long, curved dagger in battle, though a lot less\nfrequently than his sword. This dagger is used for close combat and as a\nlast resort if the sword is useless in a particular situation, such as\nwhen Aragorn is knocked down or assassinating Sauron's servants. He\nreceived a curved dagger from Celeborn in the movie, upon leaving\nLorien. In _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)_,\nAragorn uses his dagger as a finishing blow for his Final Judgment and\nWarrior Bane combos. \n\n-   Bow and arrows\n\n\n\nAragorn's next weapon in his arsenal is his bow. This bow is rarely used\nat all. Aragorn only uses it in Moria, shooting Goblins in the beginning\nof the Fight in Balin's Tomb and while fleeing the Bridge of Khazad-dûm.\nDuring these few scenes, Aragorn shows that, though he does not have the\nexpert bow skill and speed that Legolas possesses, he is still an\neffective shooter when he successfully brings down two goblins through\nsmall cracks in the door.\n\nIn “The Two Towers” and “Return of the King” video games, Aragorn's\nmissile weapon is his bow and arrows. In each case, Aragorn has 30\narrows.\n\n-   The Black Stone\n\n\n\nAragorn's final weapon is the Black Stone. He uses it once in _The\nReturn of the King_ to summon the Oathbreakers and defeat the Corsairs\nof Umbar. He is not shown using it in the movie adaptation.\n\nIn _LOTR: Conquest_, Aragorn's special, heavy attack is to summon the\nArmy of the Dead.\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II_, Aragorn's\nmost powerful ability is to summon the Army of the Dead, which appears\nas four abnormally large, invincible ghost units, who can kill infantry\nalmost instantly, though they are weak against buildings. The only units\ncapable of doing any sort of damage to the Dead are heroes, which even\nthen get immediately wiped out.\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\nWhile not appearing physically in Peter Jackson's _The Hobbit _trilogy,\nhe is alluded to by Thranduil to Legolas in ''The Hobbit: The Battle of\nthe Five Armies. ''In a departure from the books, he is stated to\nalready be a Ranger and well known among his people, rather than a ten\nyear old child. Thranduil only told him that the Ranger's name was\nStrider and that he was the son of Arathon, telling him that he would\nhave to find out Strider's true name for himself.\n\nGiven that Aragorn was 87 in _The Two Towers_, he would have been 27\nduring the Hobbit film series, since the original trilogy omitted the 17\nyear gap between where Gandalf leaves Frodo and finds out about the\nRing's origin.\n\nRalph Bakshi version\n\nAragorn was voiced by John Hurt in Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film\nversion of _The Lord of the Rings_. Bakshi's Aragorn, unlike all other\nportrayals that were to follow to date, has no beard. This actually\nconforms to a statement appearing in _Unfinished Tales_ that implicitly\nsays that Aragorn was not supposed to have one, due to his Elvish\nancestry (Elves did not grow beards). In a note written in 1972 or\nlater, among the last writings of my father's on the subject of\nMiddle-earth, there is a discussion of the Elvish strain in Men, as to\nits being observable in the beardlessness of those who were so descended\n(it was a characteristic of all Elves to be beardless. However, Tolkien\nactually wrote elsewhere that Elves _did_ have beards; in _The Lord of\nthe Rings_ itself Círdan is described as having a beard. Also, some\nviewers and critics have said that this version of Aragorn looks Native\nAmerican though not necessarily to the detriment of the film.\n\nRankin/Bass' Return of the King\n\nAragorn was voiced by Theodore Bikel in the 1980 Rankin/Bass animated\nversion of _The Return of the King_, made for television. He first\nappears at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, leading the reinforcements\nfrom southern Gondor.\n\nStage\n\n(See the stage article: _The Lord of the Rings_)\n\nAragorn was portrayed by Evan Buliung in the three-hour production of\n_The Lord of the Rings,_ which opened in 2006 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nIn the United States, Aragorn was portrayed by Josh Beshears in the\nCincinnati, Ohio production of _The Return of the King_ (2003) for Clear\nStage Cincinnati. At Chicago's Lifeline Theatre, Aragorn was played by\nRobert McLean in the 1999 production of _The Two Towers_.\n\nBorn of Hope\n\nIn the fan-film _Born of Hope_, Aragorn appears as a two-year-old\ntoddler played by the child actor Luke Johnston.\n\nRadio\n\nRobert Stephens voiced the character in the 1981 BBC Radio serial of\n_The Lord of the Rings_.\n\nVideo games\n\nAragorn appears in _LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game_ and its\nassociated toy line, LEGO The Lord of the Rings, as a minifigure; Viggo\nMortenson once again voices him through archived audio recordings."

He also was chieftain for\nlonger than any would be after him, ruling for 131 years.\n\n\nBiography\n\nAranarth was born in TA 1938 to Arvedui and Fíriel. In his youth, the\nWitch-king of Angmar was at the height of its power and destroyed the\nNorthern Kingdom, overrunning its capital city Fornost. Most of the\nsurviving people, including Aranarth, fled to Lindon, but King Arvedui\nwent north to the Ice-Bay of Forochel.

She followed her father and brothers through\nHelcaraxë and dwelt in Nevrast with her brother Turgon until Gondolin\nwas complete, and when it was she went with him to the hidden city.

They reached Gondolin (not realizing\nthat Eöl was following them all the while), and were received with\nrejoicing.

She\nalso showed a great sense of humour when she traded barbs with Aragorn.\nShe also loved Aragorn so much she was ready to give up immortality so\nshe can be with him._\n\n\nLineage\n\nArwen was the youngest child of Elrond and Celebrían; her elder brothers\nwere the twins Elladan and Elrohir. Through her father, she was the\ngranddaughter of Eärendil the Mariner (the second of the Half-Elven),\ngreat-granddaughter of Tuor of Gondolin, and therefore a direct\ndescendant of the ancient House of Hador. Arwen was also a descendant of\nKing Turgon of the Ñoldor through her great-grandmother, Idril. Through\nher mother, she was the granddaughter of Lady Galadriel and the\ngreat-granddaughter of Finarfin. Éomer of Rohan said that the Lady Arwen\nwas more fair than the Lady Galadriel of Lórien, but Gimli son of Glóin\nthought differently. Through both of her parents Arwen was a direct\ndescendant of the ancient Elven House of Finwë. Furthermore, Arwen was a\ndescendant of Beren and Lúthien Tinúviel, whose story resembled hers.\nIndeed, Arwen was held to be the reappearance in likeness of her\nancestress Lúthien, fairest of all the Elves, who was called Nightingale\n(Tinúviel).\n\n\n\nArwen was a very distant relative of her husband Aragorn. Aragorn's\nancestor, Elros Tar-Minyatur, the first King of Númenor, was her father\nElrond's brother, who chose to live as a man rather than one of the\nEldar. This means that Aragorn also has very distant Elvish ancestry.\nElros died in SA 442, some 3240 years before Arwen was born.\n\nArwen eventually became Queen of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and\nGondor when she married Aragorn, who was of the line of the Kings of\nArnor.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring ended, Arwen and Aragorn produced the future\nheir of the throne, Eldarion.\n\nBy Arwen and Aragorn's marriage, the long-sundered lines of the\nHalf-elven were joined. Their union also served to unite and preserve\nthe bloodlines of the Three Kings of the High Elves (Ingwë, Finwë, and\nthe brothers Olwë and Elwë) as well as the only line with Maiarin blood\nthrough Arwen's great-great-great grandmother, Melian, Queen of Doriath,\nand also on Aragorn's side, through the line of kings of Arnor and\nNúmenor to Elros, Elrond's brother, whose great-great-grandmother was\nalso Melian.\n\n\nAppearances in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_ (First appearance)\n-   _The Return of the King_\n\nIn the movies\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nLord of the Rings film trilogy\n\n\n\nArwen Undomiel was portrayed in _The Fellowship of the Ring_, _The\nTwo Towers_, and _The Return of the King_ by the American actress Liv\nTyler. In the _Fellowship of the Ring_ film, it was she who met Frodo\nat the ford instead of Glorfindel and wielding the sword Hadhafang,\nwhich does not appear in the books.\n\nShe was not mentioned or featured in Ralph Bakshi's _The Lord of the\nRings_.\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\n\n\nIn _The Two Towers_ movie by Peter Jackson, Arwen was originally\nsupposed to appear with the host of Elves and fight at Helm's Deep\nalongside her lover, Aragorn. This was later cut from the film.\n\nOther appearances\n\nArwen was voiced by Sonia Fraser in _The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio\nseries)_ was voiced by Kath Soucie in _The Lord of the Rings: The\nFellowship of the Ring (video game)_. In the fan film _The Hunt for\nGollum_, Arwen made an appearance and was played by Rita Ramnani. (_The\nHunt for Gollum_ (2009) In _The Lord of the Rings: Conquest_, Arwen is a\nplayable hero through a DLC. (_The Lord of the Rings: Conquest_) In (The\nLord of the Rings: War in the North.) You can visit her in Rivendell and\neven take on a side quest to locate Mithril to help her make Aragorn's\nbanner."

    "text": "FRODO BAGGINS, son of Drogo Baggins, was a Hobbit of the Shire during\nthe Third Age. He was, and still is, Tolkien's most renowned character\nfor his leading role in the Quest of the Ring, in which he bore the One\nRing to Mount Doom, where it was destroyed. He was a Ring-bearer, best\nfriend to his gardener, Samwise Gamgee, and one of the three Hobbits who\nsailed from Middle-earth to the Uttermost West at the end of the Third\nAge.\n\n\nBiography\n\nChildhood\n\nMuch of Frodo's youth was spent at Brandy Hall in Buckland, the\nancestral home of the Brandybuck family, including his mother (Primula\nBrandybuck). Frodo was known as something of a rascal, befriending\nMeriadoc (Merry) Brandybuck and Peregrin (Pippin) Took and causing\ntrouble wherever they went. They would often steal mushrooms from Farmer\nMaggot's farm Bamfurlong.  \n\nIn TA 2980, when Frodo was only 12 years old, his parents drowned in a\nboating accident on the Brandywine River. An only child, Frodo stayed in\nBrandy Hall until his 99-year-old “uncle” Bilbo adopted him in TA 2989.\nBilbo took Frodo to live with him in his home at Bag End and made him\nhis heir.\n\n\n\nThe two grew very close in the following years; Frodo learned much of\nthe Elvish language during his time with Bilbo, as well as much of the\nlore of Middle-earth. The two shared the same birthday, September 22 by\nShire Reckoning (around September 12–14 of our calendar), and a party\nof special magnificence was held at the beginning of The Fellowship of\nthe Ring when Frodo came of age of thirty-three and Bilbo hit the\npeculiar year of 111.\n\nBilbo gave a memorable Birthday Speech before playing a joke on his\nfellow hobbits by using the One Ring to disappear, at which Gandalf\nquickly reacted and used his staff to create a blinding flash where\nBilbo had been standing. The hobbits at the Party were left confused and\ndisgruntled, and Bilbo was never again seen in the Shire.\n\nBefore departing for his journey to Rivendell, Bilbo had a long\nconversation with Gandalf, who finally persuaded him to voluntarily\nsurrender the One Ring. Bilbo left it on the fireplace mantel with a\nnote for Frodo, who would now become the next Ring-bearer.\n\nComing of Age and Quest Beginning\n\n\n\nAfter the party finished, Frodo returned home and discovered that he was\nnow the master of Bag End and the recipient of Bilbo's magic ring.\nGandalf, ever more curious about the ring's origin, power, and purpose\n(but not yet positive it was the One Ring), advised the young hobbit\nagainst the using the ring. For the next seventeen years, Frodo complied\nwith the wizard's request and hid the Ring in a safe place. However, on\nApril 12, 3018, Gandalf returned to Bag End and warned Frodo that the\nRing was actually the One Ring, which the evil lord Sauron needed to\nrule over Middle-earth. Realizing that Sauron would be looking for the\nRing, Gandalf advised the Hobbit to secretly follow Bilbo's journey to\nRivendell.\n\nAfter Frodo's discussion with Gandalf, a rumor started that he was\nrunning out of money. This rumor, although not begun by Frodo, was\nencouraged by him. Merry helped Frodo to purchase a small house at\nCrickhollow. With the exception of his gardener Sam Gamgee, who had\nagreed to accompany him to Rivendell, Frodo told the other Hobbits of\nthe Shire that he intended to move to Buckland. He sold his home to the\nSackville-Baggins, and, on the September 23, 3018, the day after his\nfiftieth birthday, Frodo left from Bag End, taking with him Sam and\nPippin. They left in the early morning for Bree, and just in time, as\nSauron's most powerful servants, the nine Nazgûl, had entered the Shire\ndressed as Black riders searching for a hobbit with the name of Baggins.\n\nTo Bree\n\nFrodo was unable to find much information about his pursuers from his\nconversations with the High Elves and Farmer Maggot, but what they were\ntold was less than encouraging. When Frodo arrived at Buckland, where\nMerry was waiting, he found that Merry and Pippin already knew about\nFrodo's “secret” journey. Frodo was left with no alternative but to\nbring the two youngsters with him. They cut through the Old Forest and\nthe Barrow-downs in hopes of losing the Black Riders, which did succeed.\nThey met other troubles in those places though, at the hands of Old Man\nWillow and the Barrow-Wights, but were rescued twice by Tom Bombadil, a\nmysterious being who dwelled in a glade in the middle of the Old Forest.\n\nStrider\n\n\n\nIn Bree, the hobbits stayed at The Prancing Pony, an old inn. Frodo went\nby the name of Mr. Underhill, attempting to raise as little suspicion as\npossible. When he noticed a mysteriously cloaked Man sitting in the\nshadows and smoking a long-stemmed pipe, Frodo asked the innkeeper,\nBarliman Butterbur, who the man was. The innkeeper referred to the man,\na Ranger, as Strider.\n\nThat night, black riders arrived in Bree and attacked the inn in search\nof Frodo and the One Ring, but Strider had managed to hide the Hobbits\nfrom them in time. Having gained their trust, Strider introduced himself\nas Aragorn to Frodo and the others, to whom he also revealed the\nbackstory of the black riders, also called Nazgûl or Ringwraiths. With a\npony named Bill that the Hobbits had acquired at Bree, Strider led Frodo\nand his companions into the Wild. Aragorn would be their guide to\nRivendell, and he would lead them through the Midgewater Marshes and to\nthe top of Weathertop.\n\nWeathertop\n\n\n\nOn the night of October the sixth, the Hobbits were attacked by five of\nthe nine Ringwraiths at the hill of Weathertop. In the presence of the\nNazgûl, Frodo made the mistake of putting on the Ring. He was able to\nresist their attempt to take him by drawing his sword and invoking the\nname of one of the Valar, Elbereth Gilthoniel. Unfortunately, the leader\nof the Nazgûl, the Witch-king of Angmar, stabbed Frodo in the shoulder\n(he would have stabbed his heart) with a Morgul-blade. If it had caught\nhim in the heart, Frodo would have become like the Nazgûl, only weaker\nand under their control. The Ringwraiths were driven away by the\nappearance of Aragorn and his martial skill; also because he had\ntorches, one of their few weaknesses.\n\nThough Aragorn was a skilled healer, he could not heal Frodo's wound. A\nfragment of the Ringwraith's blade remained in Frodo's flesh, where it\ncontinued to move towards his heart. Near death (or worse), Frodo was\nrescued by Glorfindel, an Elf-lord, who put the injured Hobbit upon his\nhorse, named Asfaloth. They were pursued by the Nazgûl as Asfaloth\ncarried Frodo to the Ford of Bruinen, at the entrance to the valley of\nRivendell. Once they had crossed the River Bruinen, Frodo turned and saw\nthe Nine Ringwraiths on the other side. They ordered him to give up the\nRing, but Frodo refused.\n\n\n\nSubsequently, the Ringwraiths were washed away in a flood called up by\nElrond, the leader of Rivendell. He was healed in Rivendell by Elrond,\nalthough both of them knew that the wound would never fully heal, as it\nwas as spiritual as it was physical. On the 24th of October 3018, Frodo\nawoke in Rivendell and was reunited with Bilbo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Sam,\nMerry, and Pippin. Although Elrond had healed his wound, it continued to\nbother him for as long as he lived in Middle-earth.\n\nQuest of the Ring\n\nCouncil of Elrond\n\n\n\nAfter his healing, Frodo was summoned to a great Council that Elrond had\norganized. Representatives of all the Free Peoples of Middle-earth\ndiscussed the history of the Rings of Power and decided that the One\nRing must be destroyed. As the ring was shown and tempers flared,\nargument broke out as to who should carry the Ring on this mission,\nuntil Frodo bravely volunteered to take the Ring to Mordor and cast it\ninto the fires of Mount Doom. A member of each of the Free Peoples\noffered to join Frodo in his quest, thus forming the Fellowship of the\nRing.\n\nThe Fellowship consisted of Frodo, Samwise, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn,\nGandalf, Boromir of Gondor, Legolas of the Woodland Realm, and Gimli of\nthe Dwarves. Before leaving Rivendell, Bilbo gave Frodo his dwarf-made\ncoat of mithril mail and his elven blade Sting. The mithril coat had\nbeen given to Bilbo by Thorin after the events of _The Hobbit,_ and\nSting had been taken by Bilbo from the den of a troll. On December 25,\nthe Fellowship of the Ring departed from Rivendell and headed south.\n\nMoria\n\n\n\nOn January 11, 3019, the Fellowship attempted to cross the Misty\nMountains (specifically the Pass of Caradhras), but were unable to due\nto a snowstorm. They instead traveled through the underground city of\nMoria at the urging of Gimli. \n\nMoria (also named Khazad-dum), was the most ancient and grand of Dwarven\ncities, but was deserted when the dwarves uncovered a Balrog, known only\nas Durin's Bane, beneath the city, and had been defeated by legions of\ngoblins. When they entered the Chamber of Mazarbul, the Fellowship was\nattacked by Orcs and a cave-troll. Frodo helped to defeat the troll\nbefore he was stabbed by an orc captain, his mithril shirt saving him\nfrom a deadly blow. The Fellowship ran through Moria to the Bridge of\nKhazad-dum, where Gandalf fell while confronting Durin's Bane. Once\noutside Moria, while the Fellowship was grieving, Gimli took Frodo and\nSam to look upon the Mirrormere, even in their great hurry.\n\nLothlórien\n\n\n\nDeeply grieved by their loss, the Fellowship journeyed to the Elven\nkingdom of Lothlórien, where they met the Lady Galadriel and Lord\nCeleborn. Galadriel showed Frodo a vision of the future in her Mirror.\nFrodo offered her the One Ring, but she resisted the temptation to take\nit, passing the test that was laid before her, and accepting the\ndiminishing of the power of the elves. Before the Fellowship departed\nfrom Lothlórien, Galadriel gave each member a gift. To Frodo, she gave a\nphial with the light of the star Eärendil captured inside; this gift\nwould prove hugely important later on in the quest. They were also\nprovided with elven way-bread, other supplies, and ships for their\nvoyage down the Anduin River.\n\nThe Breaking of the Fellowship\n\n\n\nThe Fellowship continued their journey south to Amon Hen. There,\nBoromir, a Man of Gondor and a member of the Fellowship, attempted to\nconvince Frodo to bring the Ring to Minas Tirith and regroup from there.\nWhen the hobbit asked for an hour alone to consider his options, Boromir\nfollowed him. Seeing that Frodo did not intend to take the suggested\ncourse of action, Boromir tried to take the Ring from him by force.\n\nFrodo put on the Ring and escaped to the Seat of Seeing, where he\nwatched as war brewed across Middle-Earth and the Eye of Sauron\nsearching for him as he traveled.\n\n\n\nTaking off the Ring, he decided to take the item to Mordor alone,\nwithout telling the other members of the Fellowship. However, he was\njoined by his friend Samwise Gamgee, who felt it was necessary that he\nshould protect and guide Frodo. Frodo gave in to Sam's protests, and\nalthough reluctant to lead anyone else to his fate, was glad to have\nSam's company.\n\nThe two hobbits continued toward Mordor, dividing the Fellowship. Here\nBoromir was killed by uruk-archers while defending Merry and Pippin; the\ntwo young hobbits were then captured by Uruk-hai, and were to be taken\nto Isengard. Instead of following Samwise and Frodo to Mordor, the Three\nHunters decided it more important to rescue Merry and Pippin from their\ncaptors. The breaking of the Fellowship was now complete.\n\nEmyn Muil\n\nAfter leaving what remained of the Fellowship at Amon Hen, Frodo and Sam\ntried to navigate through the winding paths of the Emyn Muil. After\ngetting lost several times, they were found by Gollum, who at first\ntried to take the One Ring, but was captured by Sam (with Frodo's help)\nand tied up with the Elven rope. Frodo, now pitying the creature,\ndecided not to slay Gollum, but forced him to swear an oath of servitude\nto the master of the precious. Gollum then led them out of the maze and\ninto the Dead Marshes.\n\nThe Dead Marshes\n\n\n\nThe Dead Marshes followed the razor-sharp rocks of Emyn Muil, and were\njust as disorienting, if not more so. There was thought to be no route\nthrough the marshes, as orcs marched for miles around, although Gollum\nhad secretly discovered a path when out on one of his many errands. He\nled Frodo and Sam on a safe pathway through the marshes, warning them\nnot to follow what seemed like small torches in the water.\n\nIthilien\n\nGollum led the two Hobbits to the Black Gate of Mordor, as Frodo had\ndesired, but stopped the Hobbits from passing its doors, as the danger\nwas too great. He then explained about a secret way into Mordor, 'Up the\nstairs and through the tunnel'. The Hobbits once again found themselves\nbeing led by Gollum. After venturing into Ithilien, and witnessing a\nskirmish between a company of warriors from Haradrim (along with\nOliphaunts) and rangers from Gondor, they were apprehended by the\nranger's captain, Faramir. When the skirmish had ended, Faramir\nblindfolded the ring-bearer and his companions and led them to Henneth\nAnnûn, the Window on the West. Upon much interrogation, Samwise\nfoolishly misspoke, and gave away that Frodo was indeed carrying the One\nRing. Realizing the importance of the quest, Faramir proved his quality,\nunlike his brother, Boromir, and let the ring-bearer go free. Later,\nGollum was captured in the Forbidden Pool and forcibly taken into the\nhidden lair. Frodo begged for his safety, and he was not killed,\nalthough the rift between master and servant had once again begun to\nopen.\n\nMinas Morgul and Shelob's Lair\n\n\n\nGollum led the Hobbits past the lair of the Witch-King of Angmar, Minas\nMorgul, and up the stairs into 'The Tunnel'. When they arrived at the\ntop though, they were abandoned by Gollum. They cautiously travelled\nthrough the tunnel, and managed to get to the end only to find their way\nbarred by Shelob's great web. Whilst attempting to cut through the\nwebbing, Frodo bravely stood up to Shelob and forced her back further\ninto the tunnels giving him and Sam time enough to hack through the\nthreads and escape. Upon escaping the tunnels, Frodo thought himself\nsafe; however, Shelob, through one of her many tunnels, managed to sneak\nout and jab him with her stinger. As he was being encased in Shelob's\nwebbing, Samwise was able to draw her into single combat wherein he,\nusing Sting and the Phial of Galadriel, was able to mortally wound her\nand drive her back into her caves. Sam took the Ring from around Frodo's\nneck upon hearing Orcish voices, and hid behind some nearby rocks. He\noverheard the orcs speaking of Frodo, and Sam realized that his master\nwas not dead, but merely paralyzed. Frodo was then taken to the tower of\nCirith Ungol to await further torture and questioning.\n\nCirith Ungol\n\nFrodo was taken to the utmost top of Cirith Ungol and imprisoned.  He\nwas stripped of all his clothes and all the things he carried.\nSquabbling over his mithril vest, fighting broke out amongst the two\nlead orcs and their battalions, killing almost all the orcs and Uruk-hai\nin the tower. Sam arrived at the gate of Cirith Ungol, only to find his\nway blocked by the Two Watchers; he eventually overcame them, journeyed\nto the tower where Frodo was held, and rescued his master. They fled the\ntower, having to pass the Watchers again (although this time destroying\nthem), and entered Mordor.\n\nMordor and Mount Doom\n\nFrodo and Sam crawled onward through the empty plains of Mordor, as the\nOrcs had been sent to the Black Gate to stop the Men of the West's army,\nand, after falling in and out of a company of Orcs, started to climb\nMount Doom. They journeyed on for many days with hardly any food or\nwater, and Frodo became progressively weaker as the Ring's power over\nhim grew the closer they came to Orodruin. Frodo was eventually unable\nto go on, and Sam was forced to carry him a fair distance while his\nmaster rested upon his back. It was then that Gollum decided to\nreappear, and after a brief struggle, Sam cut Gollum in the stomach, and\nFrodo fled up the mountain.\n\n \n\nInside the Crack of Doom, Frodo finally had the chance to destroy the\nring, and rid himself of his burden, but the power of the ring was at\nits strongest, due to the proximity of the cracks. It was here that\nFrodo finally yielded to the temptation and power of the ring. Sam\nyelled for Frodo to destroy the Ring, but Frodo was overcome by its\npower and claimed the Ring for himself. Gollum attacked Sam, who fell\nand hit his head on a rock, temporarily knocking him unconscious. When\nhe came to he saw Gollum fighting with an unseen foe (Frodo, having put\non the Ring). Then Gollum bit off Frodo's finger, Ring and all, and was\nreunited with his treasure for a short time, until dancing with joy he\ntoppled off the brink and fell into the depths, destroying himself and\nthe One Ring.\n\nThe two hobbits tried to escape as the volcano erupted. Just as it\nlooked as though they were doomed, Gwaihir the Lord of Eagles saw them,\nand with his Eagle companions Landroval and Meneldor rescued Sam and\nFrodo and flew them to safety.\n\nThe End of the War and the Departure of Frodo\n\nThe Scouring of the Shire\n\n\n\nAfter recovering in Minas Tirith, and witnessing the coronation of King\nAragorn, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin all returned to the Shire. When\nthey arrived though, they found it under the control of a man named\nSharkey (later revealed to be Saruman) and his forces. Saruman was\nruling the Shire from Bag End, although he was later murdered by Grima\nWormtongue. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin however, started to gather all\nthe Shirriffs and townsfolk in the Shire, and they successfully defeated\nthe Ruffians employed by Sharkey at the Battle of Bywater.\n\n\n\nFrodo wasn't directly involved in the fighting at the Battle of Bywater;\ninstead, he made sure that no Hobbits were harmed (saying that no Hobbit\nhad ever intentionally harmed another in the Shire and that it was not\ngoing to begin there), and also that any ruffians that surrendered were\nnot harmed.\n\nThe Fourth Age\n\n\n\nFrodo briefly served as Deputy Mayor of the Shire, but soon realized\nthat he still bore the wounds of his quest, and so retired. He was also\nin continual pain from his shoulder wound, which pained him each\nanniversary of their stay on Weathertop. On 22 September SR 1421 (Fourth\nAge), at the age of 53, Frodo joined Bilbo, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel,\nand Círdan aboard an Elven ship. He was allowed passage across the sea\nto the Undying Lands, as he was a ring-bearer, with the hope of healing\nthe damage to his spirit that bearing the Ring had caused. Sometime\nafter the year 61 in the Fourth Age, fellow ring-bearer and best friend\nSamwise Gamgee, reunited with Frodo in the undying lands where it was\npresumed they lived out the remainder of their days.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nFrodo, as described by Gandalf, was “taller than some and fairer than\nmost, (with) a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye.” (_The\nFellowship of the Ring_, Chapter 10, “Strider”)'' ''He was a shy, young\nhobbit with thick, curly brown hair like most other hobbits, and had\nlighter-than-usual skin due to his Fallohide ancestry through his\nBrandybuck mother. He could be described as fairly good looking for a\nhobbit. Frodo is described as appearing thirty-three, even when he is\nfifty, due to the influence of the Ring. Bilbo and Frodo shared a common\nbirthday on September 22, but Bilbo was 78 years Frodo's senior. At the\nopening of _The Fellowship of the Ring_, Frodo and Bilbo were\ncelebrating their thirty-third and eleventy-first (111th) birthdays,\nrespectively. Frodo, like Bilbo, was considered by many others in\nHobbiton to be a little odd. His curiosity of the outside world,\nfascination with Elves and faraway places (like those to which Bilbo\ntravelled in _The Hobbit_) did not fit the general content personality\nof most Hobbits. This curiosity was also attributed to his Took\nancestry. He was very kind and compassionate, pitying Gollum and\nallowing him to guide him and Sam to Mordor despite Sam's distrust of\nthe creature. This act of kindness later proved to be a factor in the\nquest's success in destroying the Ring. The influence of the Ring and\nthe wound by the Morgul-Blade seems combined to have given him the\nability to see into the spirit world, for instance he sees faraway\nevents in his dreams on several occasions. He also can see the ring of\npower worn by Galadriel and he seems to be able to sense danger.\n\n\nWeapons and Attire\n\nFrodo was dressed in typical Hobbit-fashion when he left the Shire: knee\nbreeches, shirt, waistcoat, jacket, and cloak. Colors such as bright\ngreen and yellow were typical for Shire-folk. He was unarmed, save for a\npocketknife.\n\nWhen his little group was waylaid by Barrow-wights, he lost his\nsummer-weight clothing and was wearing a burial shrift when rescued by\nTom Bombadil. When their pack-ponies returned, he was forced to put on\nheavier woollen clothing intended for colder weather. The Hobbits found\nseveral long Dúnedain daggers in the wight's treasure. These served as\nshort-swords for the Hobbits, but Frodo's was broken when he resisted\nthe Witch-king at Weathertop. At Imladris, he removed his Hobbit\nclothing upon finding new Elven clothes that fitted him perfectly.\nTherefore, throughout his quest, he wore a green silk tunic, trousers\ntogether with cloaks made of fur for the first stages of the quest, and\nthen towards Mordor he shed them to wear his tunic and trousers in the\nwarmer weather. Later, his Uncle Bilbo gave him both Sting, a magic\nElven dagger, and a coat of mithril chain mail. The mail saved his life\ntwice, first when it deflected a spear-point in the Mines of Moria, and\nsecond when it turned aside the dagger that Saruman used to try and kill\nhim.\n\nAs with the other members of the Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo received\na special cloak from Galadriel in Lórien, which allowed him to blend in\nwith natural surroundings. Upon being betrayed by Gollum and captured by\nOrcs at Cirith Ungol, Frodo lost all of his clothing and most of his\npossessions. Sam Gamgee saved Sting, however. After the two tribes of\norcs had slain each other in the tower of Cirith Ungol, Frodo dressed\nhimself in Orc-garb. This successfully fooled the Mordor-Orcs they\nencountered, but he dropped the Orc mail and helmet as he and Sam\napproached Mount Doom.\n\nCombat\n\nSword\n\nFrodo used Bilbo's famed short sword Sting for melee combat, it was also\nput to great use as it warns him of nearby orcs and goblins by glowing\nblue.\n\n\nAppearances\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n-   _The Silmarillion_\n\nIn the movies\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n-   _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_\n\nWritings\n\n-   The Return and Departures of Frodo and Sam\n-   The Days of Rohan\n-   The Battles of Shilverman and Bywater\n\n\nHistory and Conception\n\nConception\n\nOriginally, Frodo was to be named Bingo Bolger-Baggins, but as the work\nbecame more serious, that name was dropped.\n\n\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nRalph Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings\n\n\n\nChristopher Guard voiced Frodo in Ralph Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings\n(1978 film) with Sharon Baird doing the modeling.\n\nRankin/Bass\n\nOrson Bean voiced Frodo in the Rankin/Bass _The Return of the King_\nfilm.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film trilogy\n\nThere are several differences between Peter Jackson's Film Trilogy and\nthe book _The Fellowship of the Ring_. In the movies, Frodo seems to\nhave owned the Ring for only a few days or perhaps a few months before\nGandalf returned, as opposed to the seventeen years of the book. Frodo\nnever sells Bag End, but sets out early next morning with Sam. Merry and\nPippin run into the pair at the farm of Farmer Maggot and are pulled\ninto the journey. The Hobbits are pursued by the Black Riders all the\nway to Bucklebury Ferry on the borders of Buckland. There the Black\nRiders are forced to ride to the Brandywine Bridge while the Hobbits\nmake for Bree. The movies remove several parts of the journey as well.\nThese include their encounters with the High Elves, Farmer Maggot, and\nTom Bombadil, as well as their visit to Buckland, the Old Forest, and\nthe Barrow-downs.\n\nArwen, Elrond's daughter, leads Frodo to Rivendell instead of\nGlorfindel. The Cave-troll inflicts the wound on Frodo in Moria, instead\nof the orc captain. In the novel, Faramir declared right from the first\nthat he wanted no part of the One Ring, but in the film Faramir at first\nfollows what he believes is his duty to bring the Ring back to Minas\nTirith. But while travelling with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum through the\ncity of Osgiliath, the city is attacked by a Nazgûl and the forces of\nMordor, and Faramir realizes he should not take the Ring after he sees\nthe effect it has on Frodo.\n\nOther\n\nHe is also portrayed by Taneli Mäkelä in the Finnish 1993 production\nHobbit.\n\nRadio\n\nFrodo was voiced by Oliver Burt in The Lord of the Rings (1956 radio\nseries), James Arrington in The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series),\nIan Holm in The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series), Nigel Planer in\nTales from the Perilous Realm (1992 radio series), Elijah Wood in Lord\nof the Rings film trilogy, and Steve Staley in The Lord of the Rings:\nThe Fellowship of the Ring (video game).\n\nParodies\n\nFrodo was portrayed by Lauren Lopez in a parody of Lord of the Rings by\nthe group Team Starkid.\n\n\nTrivia\n\n-   Faramir's Vision\n    -   There is a deleted scene in ''The Two Towers ''of Faramir\n        visioning Frodo becoming a creature like Gollum, which wasn't\n        even used in the extended edition.\n-   Frodo has the most mentions of any character throughout the entire\n    Lord of the Ringsnovel trilogy, with 2028 mentions.\n-   Frodo has a street named after him in the Dutch town of Geldrop."

His rule may have been a peaceful and\nuneventful one. It was during his time as King, after his father's\npassing, that many party gifts of different varieties were ordered for\nuse at Bilbo's Farewell Birthday Party in TA 3001. Bain presumably died\nin TA 3007, as that was when his son, Brand, became King. His son would\nlater fight in the War of the Ring at the Battle of Dale, where he was\nslain.\n\n\nAppearances in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_ (mentioned only)\n-   _The Lord of the Rings: Appendix B, “The Third Age”_\n\nIn the films\n\n-   _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_\n-   _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\nBain is shown to be in his teen years in _The Hobbit: The Desolation of\nSmaug_ and is played by John Bell. There are two additional members of\nhis family, Sigrid and Tilda, who are his sisters.\n\nIn _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_, Bain is present with his\nsisters when his father returns home with Thorin and Company. After\nhearing the Dwarves recite the tale of how Lord Girion used Black Arrows\nagainst Smaug, Bain added that Girion managed to dislodge a scale off\nthe dragon.

As night fell, they felt the ground shake as the\nDragon awakened. Bard then reveals that he had one last Black Arrow in\nhis possession.

    "name": "Balin",
    "lotrUrl": "https://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Balin",
    "race": "Dwarf",
    "text": "BALIN was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of\nDwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II\nOakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.\n\nA Dwarf Lord, Balin was old and wise, he was one of Thorin's closest\nfriends and advisors, and was always willing to listen and offer wise\ncounsel. Balin is distantly related to Thorin, and is a descendant of\nthe noble house of Durin.\n\nHe later went to reestablish the kingdom of Dwarves, Moria, but in five\nyears it was reovercome by Orcs, and he was killed there.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\nBalin was a Dwarf, son of Fundin, and likely born in the Lonely Mountain\nbefore the coming of Smaug the Dragon. He had a younger brother named\nDwalin and was one of those driven from their homes when the dragon\nSmaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards he may have lived in\nDunland as a refugee. He fought in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. Many\nyears later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the\nfather of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain\nhimself, but Thráin was captured and lost.\n\nThe Quest of Erebor\n\n\n\nBalin was part of the company assembled by Thorin Oakenshield that\njourneys to the Lonely Mountain with Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf to defeat\nSmaug and retake the mountain kingdom of Erebor. He was the second Dwarf\nto arrive at Bilbo's house, where like his brother Dwalin he played a\nviol as big as himself. Among the Dwarves of the company, Balin was the\nsecond-eldest dwarf on the quest, and loosely, held the position of\ndeputy leader. He led the Dwarves in their escape from the spiders and,\nwhen Thorin was absent, spoke for the party when the Elven King\nThranduil captured them.\n\nHe is described as “always their look-out man”: He spots Bilbo\napproaching The Green Dragon Inn at Bywater, he spots the trolls' fire,\nand he's the first to spot the Elves in Mirkwood. He noted that not even\na mouse had ever passed him on watch, and wondered why he did not notice\nBilbo (hidden by wearing the magic ring) when he was lookout for the\ncompany after escaping the Orcs in the Misty Mountains.\n\nBalin gained respect for Bilbo's abilities, and was the only dwarf who\nvolunteered to accompany Bilbo down the secret passage to Smaug's\nchamber. Of all the Dwarves in the quest, Balin was the only one known\nto have visited Bilbo at Bag End after their experiences on the quest\nfor the Lonely Mountain.\n\nExpedition and Death\n\n\n\nBalin later led an expedition in an attempt to reclaim the ancient dwarf\nkingdom of Moria, hoping to regain both the wealth of Moria and the last\nof the Seven Rings of the Dwarves. Ultimately, the search for the\nring—which conferred great wealth and a curse of greed on its owners—was\nin vain, as it had been recaptured from Thráin II by Sauron. Balin\nhimself was killed by an Orc during his quest to re-establish the\ndwarven kingdom of Moria.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nRankin/Bass films\n\nIn the 1977 animated version of _The Hobbit_, he was voiced by Don\nMessick.\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\nIn Peter Jackson's live-action adaptation, he was portrayed by Scottish\nactor Ken Stott. The studio released the following statement regarding\nBalin in the films:\n\n  _A descendant of nobility and a Dwarf Lord in his own right, Balin is\n  one of the oldest members of The Company of Dwarves. Wise and gentle\n  by nature, he has been forced to live a life fraught with war and the\n  ongoing struggle for survival. Related to Thorin Oakenshield, Balin is\n  one of his closest, most trusted advisers – but deep in his heart,\n  this wisest and most loyal of Dwarves harbors troubling doubts about\n  the wisdom of the Quest for the Lonely Mountain._\n\nIn _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_, Balin persuades Bard the\nBowman to take them safely to Lake-town in return for a huge amount of\nmoney (double Bard's usual barge fare), an event that did not occur in\nthe book.\n\nPersonality\n\nBalin is portrayed to be the wiser, more social and skeptical individual\nin Thorin and Company. He is kind, sly and brave, an excellent fighter.\nThorin, at one point, quoted on Balin's skill as a fighter. He develops\nan essentially strong relationship with the other Dwarves he travelled\nwith and was willing to fight alongside them for any cause. He was\nsympathetic, sometimes cynical, towards Bilbo Baggins, remarking that\nthe latter wasn't fit for the job they had set out to do. He got on\nbrilliantly with Thorin, and seemed to share something of a\ngrandfatherly view of the latter.\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nEach of the _Hobbit_ film's actors had a voice in the nature and design\nof their own weaponry. Ken Stott, who plays Balin, asked the filmmakers\nfor a weapon “somewhere between an axe and a sword.”\n\n\nAppearances\n\nIn the Films\n\n-   _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_ (First appearance)\n-   _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_\n-   _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_\n-   _The Hobbit (1977 animated film)_\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring (film)_ (Mentioned and Tomb only)\n\nIn the Books\n\n-   _The Hobbit_\n-   ''The Fellowship of the Ring (novel) ''(Mentioned)\n\n\nTrivia\n\n-   While in the Book, Balin is about twenty years younger than Thorin,\n    in Peter Jackson's three-part adaptation, Balin is ranked as the\n    oldest member of the company.\n-   In the 1977 Rankin/Bass adaptation of 'The Hobbit', Balin, voiced by\n    Don Messick, is one of the few dwarves to have a major role in the\n    film.\n-   In Peter Jackson's films, Balin fights with a weapon with\n    similarities of a sword and a mace, which Ken Stott, asked for\n    himself.\n-   Of all the dwarves on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain,\n    Balin was the only dwarf known to have visited Bilbo Baggins after\n    the journey."

He was also the fourth Lord of Ladros and the seventh and\nprobably last Chieftain of the Bëorians after his deceased elder brother\nBregolas. Besides his elder brother, Barahir had three elder\nsisters: _Bregil_, _Hirwen_, and _Gilwen_.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarlier, Barahir had fought at the Dagor Bragollach, saving Finrod\nFelagund's life earning him and his house the friendship of the House of\nFinarfin. For this, he received “Barahir's Ring”, which was then handed\ndown the family line. After the Dagor Bragollach by FA 456, Barahir\nlived with twelve companions on the highland of Dorthonion at Tarn\nAeluin as outlaws defying the will of Morgoth whose forces hunted him\nand his company like wild beasts. The members of Barahir's outlaw\nband was his son Beren, his nephews Baragund the elder and Belegund the\nyounger, Radhruin and Dairuin, Dagnir and Ragnor, Gildor and Gorlim _the\nUnhappy_, Arthad, and Urthel, and Hathaldir _the Young_. As for his wife\nEmeldir, she parted from Barahir when she became the leader of the women\nand children of Bëor's folk that fled Dorthonion. For her bravery in\nthis, Barahir's wife was known as _Emeldir the Man-hearted_,\n\nFor five years, Barahir led his doomed band of outlaws until FA 460 when\nthey were betrayed to Sauron by Gorlim, a lovesick member of Barahir's\noutlaw band and Barahir was killed at Tarn Aeluin along with everyone in\nhis company save for Beren his son who was gone on an errand for them\nand thus luckily happened to be not there. Barahir's remains were buried\nin a cairn by his son at Tarn Aeluin save for his hand which was chopped\noff by an Orc captain of Morgoth. Beren later slew that Orc-captain and\nrecovered the renowned Ring of Barahir. Barahir's son then escaped\nDorthonion after all and lived on to fulfill a great destiny.\n\nLegacy\n\nBarahir's service to Finrod and House of Finarfin left behind a legacy\nof respect between the House of Bëor, later generations of Men, and\nElves. This friendship led to the close association of the elves and the\nDúnedain of Númenor and Arnor and Gondor. His ring also became an\nheirloom of the Dúnedain of the North of Middle-earth.\n\n\nLater namesakes\n\nBarahir was also the name of the eighth Steward of Gondor and was also\nthe name of the grandson of Faramir and Éowyn in the Fourth Age, who\nwrote _The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen_.\n\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nThe character of Barahir evolved out of the character Egnor bo-Rimion\n(see _The Book of Lost Tales_ and _Beren and Lúthien_ novel). In the\noriginal Barahir was originally a Gnome, an Elf. The Tale of Tinúviel\nsaw a 1925 (and later) edit that changed Egnor into Barahir a Noldoli\nElf. At some point the character evolved into a Man. However, its noted\nin _'Beren and Luthien_ that the in the original pre-1917 transcript\nwhich J.R.R. Tolkien erased and wrote over that Beren was originally a\nMan, before he rewrote the character as an Elf, and would go back to\nmaking him a Man in _Lay of Leithian_ (though the narrative included in\nthe new novel has Beren switching between both races depending on the\nsection documents)."

    "text": "BARD, known also as BARD THE BOWMAN, and less chiefly, BARD THE FIRST,\nwas a man of Laketown, the slayer of the dragon Smaug, and the founder\nand first king of the new Kingdom of Dale. He was succeeded as King of\nDale by his son, Bain.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nBard was descended from Lord Girion of Dale, whose wife and child had\nescaped to Laketown when Smaug ruined Dale and took the Lonely Mountain\nin TA 2770.\n\nIn TA 2941, when Smaug emerged from the Lonely Mountain and attacked\nLaketown, Bard, as captain of a company of town archers, was encouraging\nthe archers and urging the town Master to order them to fight to the\nlast arrow. Bard himself fired many arrows with his great yew bow. He\nwas down to his last arrow when a thrush came and perched on his\nshoulder. Because Bard was of the race of Dale, he was able to\nunderstand the thrush's words. The bird told him of the weak spot in\nSmaug's armor that Bilbo Baggins had discovered. Bard fired his Black\nArrow and struck the hollow by Smaug's left breast and the dragon fell\nfrom the sky, landing on Laketown and destroying it.\n\nBard escaped into the lake and swam ashore. The people wanted him to be\ntheir King, but he said he would continue to serve the Master of\nLaketown for the time being. Bard took charge of organizing shelter and\naid for the refugees and sent messages to the Elvenking of Mirkwood\nasking for help. Then, Bard and the Elvenking led their armies to the\nLonely Mountain, seeking a share of the treasure.\n\nWhen they arrived at the Lonely Mountain, they were surprised to find\nThorin Oakenshield and his company of Dwarves still alive. Bard sought\nreparations from Thorin on the grounds that it was he who had slain\nSmaug, that part of the Dragon’s treasure had once belonged to Dale, and\nthat the people of Laketown were suffering and needed aid. Thorin said\nthat the destruction of Laketown was not his responsibility and he\nrefused to parley with armies camped outside the mountain. Bard sent a\nmessenger several hours later asking for one-twelfth of the treasure,\nbut again Thorin refused.\n\n\n\nBilbo Baggins thought that Bard's claims were reasonable, so one night\nhe went secretly to the camp of the Lakemen and Elves. The Hobbit had\nfound the Arkenstone - the treasure that Thorin most desired - and he\noffered it to Bard and Thranduil to use to negotiate. He also told them\nthat an army of 500 Dwarves led by Dain II Ironfoot was coming from the\nIron Hills.\n\nThe next day, Bard asked Thorin for a portion of the treasure in\nexchange for the Arkenstone. Thorin was enraged, but he reluctantly\nagreed to give up Bilbo's one-fourteenth share. Dain's army arrived the\nnext day, and Bard tried to prevent them from entering the Lonely\nMountain until the exchange for the Arkenstone had been made. A battle\nseemed imminent, but then Gandalf told them that an army of Goblins and\nWargs were approaching. Bard, Thranduil, and Dain took council together\nand they joined forces to fight their common enemy in the Battle of the\nFive Armies. During the battle, Thorin had emerged from the mountain and\nhad rallied Dwarves, Elves, and Men to the attack, but he was mortally\nwounded. Bard laid the Arkenstone upon Thorin's breast when he was\nburied under the mountain, and Dain agreed to pay the one-fourteenth\nshare of the treasure as promised. Bard gave the emeralds of Girion to\nThranduil and Bilbo agreed to take a small chest of gold and one of\nsilver. Bard also contributed gold for the aid of Laketown, and although\nthe Master of Laketown absconded with much of it, Laketown was rebuilt\nand its people became prosperous.\n\nBard went to his ancestral home of Dale at the foot of the Lonely\nMountain. He rebuilt the ruined town and in TA 2944, he became King of\nDale. Bard maintained good relations with the Dwarves of the Lonely\nMountain and trade flowed freely up and down the River Running. People\ncame to settle in Dale from miles around and the land that had been\nwithered by Smaug became bountiful once more.\n\nBard died in TA 2977. His son Bain succeeded him as King of Dale.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nGene Deitch\n\nAlong with Bard, many characters of importance were omitted in this work\nfrom 1966.\n\nRankin and Bass\n\nIn the 1977 film _The Hobbit_, Bard was voiced by John Stephenson.\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\n\n\nBard is portrayed by the Welsh actor Luke Evans in _The Hobbit: The\nDesolation of Smaug_ who bears a striking resemblance to Legolas' actor\nOrlando Bloom. Here he is referred to as Bard the Bargeman rather than\ncaptain of the town archers. He has also appeared in _The Hobbit: The\nBattle of the Five Armies_.\n\nIn addition to his son Bain, the film version of Bard also has two\ndaughters, Sigrid and Tilda, played in _The Desolation of Smaug_ by\nJames Nesbitt's daughters, Peggy and Mary, respectively.\n\nIn the book, the first we read of Bard was when he, as captain of a\ncompany of town archers, was urging the town Master to order a fight to\nthe last arrow, and was himself shooting arrows at the attacking dragon.\nHe never recited the above-quoted “prophecy.” But in the movie the\ncharacter takes on a much greater role.\n\n\n\nIn _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_, Bard confronts the Dwarves\nupon finding them on the river bank. Balin persuades Bard to smuggle\nthem into Lake-town, promising to pay him double his usual barge fare.\nBard is hesitant at first, not wanting Thranduil to be angry at\nLake-town, but eventually smuggles the Company into the town and leads\nthem to his house where they stay for the night. When Bard realizes that\nThorin is actually Thorin Oakenshield of the line of Durin, he goes out\nto a shop to find a tapestry of the line of Durin before reciting a\nprophecy of the Mountain King's return. He returned to his house to find\nthat the Dwarves had left to raid the armoury and thus left to find\nthem. By the time he did, the Dwarves had been caught and Thorin\nrevealed his identity to the Master of Lake-town. Bard vocalized his\nopposition to letting the Dwarves enter the Lonely Mountain, fearing\nthat they would awaken Smaug, who would destroy Lake-Town in\nretaliation, but by appealing to their hopes for the return of\nprosperity, Thorin is able to persuade the Master and the townspeople to\nsupport him.\n\nKili becomes gravely ill from a poisoned arrow which had hit him\npreviously during an orc attack, and is left behind as Thorin and the\nothers head to the Lonely Mountain. Fili, Bofur, and Óin stay to tend\nhim, taking refuge in Bard's home. Óin asks Bard if there is any\nKingsfoil, and Bard says it's a weed they use to feed the pigs, so Bofur\nsets off to get some. Then, Bolg and his orc troops, searching for\nThorin, attack the Dwarves and Bard's family. Fortunately, Legolas and\nTauriel arrive in time to rescue them. When Smaug is finally awakened,\nBard takes out the Black Arrow and prepares to use it, but as he and\nBain attempt to get to the Dwarvish wind lance to mount the Black Arrow,\nthe town guard began searching for Bard at the orders of the Master.\nPassing Bain the Black Arrow and instructing him to hide it, Bard\nattempts to lead the guards away is soon captured and imprisoned as\nSmaug flies towards the Lake-town.\n\n\n\nIn _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_, Bard escapes prison by\nwrapping a rope around the Master of Lake-town's neck. Which when his\nboat goes forward the door to the prison breaks. Bard then steals a\nquiver of arrows and a longbow, climbs to the top of a large tower and\nproceeds to shoot Smaug, who is currently burning Lake-town. Bard\neventually runs out of arrows and his son, Bain comes up with the Black\nArrow. Bard's bow has now been broken, so he ties the bow string to the\nposts on the tower and rests the Black Arrow on Bain's shoulder. Bard\nnocks the arrow, pulls it back and fires; the arrow hitting Smaug right\nwhere his scale is missing. Smaug's corpse then falls in the lake and on\nthe Master's boat, killing him, Braga, and two other guards.\n\n\n\nBard then leads the surviving people of Lake-town to Dale, not knowing\nthat the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain have already taken control of\nthe Lonely Mountain. The refugees from Lake-town stay in Dale for the\nnight. The next morning Thranduil and the Elves of Mirkwood arrive and\ngive the people of Lake-Town food. Bard and Thranduil form an alliance\nto take back their rightful treasure in Erebor. Thranduil explains to\nBard that he came here to claim something of his, white gems. Bard\nexplains to Thranduil that he want to speak to Thorin first, possibly to\nprevent conflict. Bard first speaks with Thorin, but returns with the\nnews that Thorin will give them nothing. Thranduil thinks little of it\nand declares war on the Dwarves.\n\nThat night Bilbo sneaks out of the mountain for a meeting with Bard and\nThranduil, and much to Bilbo's surprise Gandalf is present. He gives\nthem the Arkenstone in hope it will make peace with the Dwarves. The\nnext morning the elves and men march up to the Lonely Mountain where\nBard offers Thorin the Arkenstone. Thorin refuses and almost kills Bilbo\nafter he finds out from Bilbo what happened. However, just before Thorin\ncan harm Bilbo Gandalf then arrives. Gandalf demands Thorin not to harm\nhis “burglar” and demands Thorin to return Bilbo to him at once.\nAfterward Bard asks, “Are we resolved? The return of the Arkenstone for\nwhat was promised?” Thorin gives Bard one glance then looks to the\nNorthwest seeing no sign of the crow that was sent to Dain Ironfoot.\nBard then says “Give us your answer. Will you have peace, or war?” Then\nthe raven returns and marching is heard, Dain Ironfoot and the army of\nDwarves march down proudly to Thorin's aid, Thorin replies to Bard's\nquestion, “I will have war.” When the elves go to attack the Dwarves\nfrom the Iron Hills, Dain Ironfoot arrives on the scene Gandalf tries to\nreason with Dain that orcs are coming and he should stand down but Dain\nrefuses. After Dain and King Thranduril have a bitter exchange of words,\nDain declares war.\n\nHowever, before the Dwarves and Elves can even attack each other, the\norcs being led by Azog arrive, and The Battle of Five Armies begins.\nGandalf realizing Azog's plan knows the Lake-town, Mirkwood, and Iron\nHills Armies all can't fight on two fronts. Bard leads his Men back to\nthe city of Dale to defend the city for the remainder of the battle."

    "race": "Human",
    "text": "BEORN was a Northman, a Skin-changer, and a Beorning chieftain. Beorn's\nkin once inhabited the North of the Anduin valley between the Misty\nMountains and Mirkwood during the last centuries of the Third Age. They\nguarded the Ford of Carrock from the Goblins and Wargs.\n\n\nBiography\n\nThird Age\n\nBeorn was a warrior with great strength who could turn into a great\nblack bear. In human form, he appeared as a, tall, black-haired man with\nhuge arms and a great beard. Beorn kept many animals at his residence,\nsuch as horses, dogs and sheep. His animals were all extremely\nintelligent; his dogs, for instance, could walk on their hind legs while\ncarrying things with their forelegs, set the table, and able to speak.\nBeorn's horses could also understand what their master said. Beorn was\nalso capable of speaking in the tongue of beasts, as he could\ncommunicate with bears. When he spoke to his dogs, his words sounded\nlike “barks twisted into some form of speech”.\n\nThe Quest of Erebor\n\n\n\nIn the years following the Battle of Five Armies, Beorn became a great\nchieftain among the folk of the Anduin Vales and his followers became\nknown as the Beornings. At some point he took a wife and sired a son,\nGrimbeorn, later known as Grimbeorn the Old. Before the War of the Ring,\nBeorn passed away, and his son Grimbeorn eventually took over his\nduties as chieftain. \n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _BEORN_ originates from an Old English term that means\n“warrior” . It is a cognate to the Old Norse _bjǫrn_ which means\n“bear”.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nDespite being incredibly powerful, Beorn respects all life forms, with\nthe absolute exception of Goblins and Wargs. He has a magic-like effect\non his animals, who seemed to be more intelligent and strong than other\nanimals. He keeps bee pastures and spends his nights patrolling the\nwoods and mountains in the form of a bear. He is wise, mysterious and\npowerful, possessing incredible strength and durability. He is fairly\ndecent, as he allows Thorin and Company to stay at his home for a short\nwhile and even offers them sanctuary from the Goblins. He is also\nvengeful. When Thorin is fatally wounded, he storms the Goblin ranks,\nrescues Thorin and then returns, destroying the Goblins and killing Bolg\nhimself.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\n\n\nBeorn is portrayed by Mikael Persbrandt in the films _The Desolation of\nSmaug_ and ''The Battle of the Five Armies. ''His appearance in the\nfilms is quite different than his description in the book and portrayals\nin other media. In the films, he has greyish-brown hair, a forked beard,\nshackles on his left arm, and a mane of hair growing as a ridge down the\nlength of his back. Beorn mentioned his fellow Shape Shifters, who once\nlived in the mountains before Azog the Defiler came down from the north\nand killed or enslaved many of his people for sport. Beorn escaped the\nterrible fate of his kin (explaining the shackles on his arm), and\nclaims that he is the last of their kind. He gives them horses to reach\nMirkwood and provides escort to protect them from roaming Orcs. Beorn\nappears to be aware of the dark presence in Dol Guldur as he knows of an\nalliance between the Orcs of Moria and the Necromancer, whom he calls\nthe Sorcerer, in Dol Guldur. Packs of Orcs have been seen gathering in\nthe fortress with their numbers increasing every day. Beorn also knows\nthat the Necromancer is not what he seems to be and that dark and foul\nthings are drawn to his power, not to mention Azog's allegiance to him.\nHe also heard word spread of the dead rising and walking near the High\nFells of Rhudaur. He asked Gandalf if there actually were tombs in those\nmountains and Gandalf confirms the tombs as Beorn remembered a time when\na great evil ruled the lands and had the power to raise the dead. If\nthat evil had returned, he wished to know from Gandalf.\n\nIn _The Battle of the Five Armies_, he makes a brief cameo during the\nbattle, shifting from man to bear form as he arrives with the Great\nEagles, attacking several goblins and wargs. He is later seen at the\nfuneral for Thorin, Fili and Kili. \n\nBeorn's personality is notably different from what it is in the book.\nInstead of being boisterous and impatient, Beorn is depicted as\nsoft-spoken and collected. Beorn is also said to be in little control of\nhimself in the _The Desolation of Smaug_, but in the book, he can be\ntame and gentle as a bear, even following the Dwarves to ensure the\nreturn of his ponies when the Dwarves leave his house to go to Mirkwood."

    "text": "BEREN, also called BEREN ERCHAMION, was a man of Middle-earth, and a\nhero whose romance with the Elf Lúthien was one of the great stories of\nthe Elder Days that were told for many ages after he lived.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nEarly life in Dorthonion\n\nBeren was an Edain (a man), the son of Barahir and Emeldir the\nman-hearted. He was a man of the royal House of Bëor of Dorthonion, and\nthe most accomplished hero and adventurer of the First Age. The battle\nof the Dagor Bragollach befell during his youth, bringing about the ruin\nof his kingdom. The young Beren lived with his father and eleven loyal\nfollowers in the highlands of Dorthonion, and the thirteen of them\nperformed many acts of bravery, to the great frustration of Morgoth, the\nDark King of Angband. After the ruin of the Outlaws of Dorthonion and\nthe death of his father, Beren lived alone in Dorthonion off the land\nand came to know the many birds and beasts that lived there, and they\nhelped him when he needed it. During this time, he hunted nothing and\nate no meat and only killed the creatures of Morgoth that roamed the\ncountry. He learned not to fear death only captivity and bondage;\nhowever, things began to grow more difficult for him in Dorthonion for\nMorgoth put an even greater price on his head and he was forced from the\nland of his birth by Sauron and Draugluin. He crossed into Doriath,\nthrough the forests of Dungortheb, where he saw and fell in love with\nLúthien, princess of the Sindar and daughter of Thingol and Melian.\n\nThe Quest for the Silmaril\n\n Thingol\nhaughtily refused to give Lúthien's hand in marriage. He said that he\nwould allow the marriage to take place only if Beren brought back a\nSilmaril from the Iron Crown of Morgoth. The task was intended to be\nimpossible, but Beren and Lúthien, with the aid of Finrod of Nargothrond\nand Huan the Great Hound (both of whom died protecting Beren), braved\nmany perils (even besting Sauron, then Morgoth's most powerful\nlieutenant) and captured a Silmaril. However, as they escaped from\nAngband, the great wolf Carcharoth, whom Morgoth had personally bred,\nawoke. Beren held out the Silmaril, hoping that its radiance would avert\nthe beast, but he was mistaken. Carcharoth bit off his hand swallowed it\nand the Silmaril (thus Beren was called ERCHAMION, One-hand), and\nproceeded to run rampant through Doriath. Lúthien and the unconscious\nBeren were rescued by the Eagles of Manwë. When he presented himself to\nThingol, he demonstrated to him that he had obtained, then lost the\nSilmaril at the cost of one of his hands; he was then given the name\nCAMLOST, Empty-handed. Beren participated in the hunting of Carcharoth,\nwhere the beast was slain and the Silmaril recovered; the quest was\naccomplished, but in the process Beren was mortally wounded.\n\nSecond life\n\n\n\nLúthien's love for Beren was so strong that, upon hearing of his death,\nshe lay down and died. Her soul went to the Halls of Mandos, where she\nmanaged to charm Mandos into granting her a wish. Both she and Beren\nwere miraculously restored to life, but both of them would live as\nmortals and die the death of Men, and go beyond the walls of Arda to a\nplace unknown. Thus Beren and Lúthien lived again, and dwelt on Tol\nGalen in the middle of the river Adurant in Ossiriand. There they stayed\napart from other mortals; Beren was involved with the events of the\nFirst Age only one further time, when he waylaid a group of dwarves who\nhad destroyed Doriath and stolen the Nauglamír (and the Silmaril with\nit).\n\nLúthien bore Beren a son, named Dior, Thingol's heir, considered to be\none of the fairest beings to ever live, for in him flowed the blood of\nmen, of elves, and of the Ainur. Through his descendants, the blood of\nBeren and of Lúthien was preserved among the Eldar and the Edain.\n\nLegacy\n\nBeren's deeds inspired all the peoples opposing Morgoth to unite\nthemselves into a greater force to vanquish his power resulting in the\nvaliant but doomed Union of Maedhros. His romance and love for\nLúthien Tinúviel and what he was willing to do to ensure it helped\nfoster greater respect for men amongst the elves. He was also the first\nto mix the blood of elves and men with each other and this bloodline\ncontinued, siring the Númenórean nobility and the Dúnedain alike on\nup to Aragorn II Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Noldorin, the name _BEREN_ means “Bold”.\n\nHis epithets, _Erchamion_ (“one-handed”) and _Camlost_ (“empty-handed”),\nboth contain the Sindarin word _cam_ (“hand”).\n\n\nWeapons\n\nAs an outlaw in Dorthonion, Beren used Dagmor and a bow to aid him in\nhis journey. Later, he carried a knife called Angrist, which he used\nto cut the Silmaril from the Crown of Morgoth.\n\n\nInspiration and evolution of character\n\nThe story of Beren and Lúthien, though mentioned only briefly in _The\nLord of the Rings_, was a central part of the legendarium. Tolkien once\nreferred to it as “the kernel of the mythology” . He went on to say\nthat it \"arose from a small woodland glade filled with 'hemlocks', which\nhe visited while serving in the Humber Garrison in 1918 (during World\nWar I).\n\nTyr, a god of Norse Mythology, was a possible literary inspiration for\nBeren's loss of his hand to the wolf.\n\nWhen Tolkien died in 1973, he was buried in Wolvercote Cemetery (North\nOxford). The inscription on his gravestone reads:\n\n    JOHN RONALD REUEL TOLKIEN Beren 1892 - 1973\n\nThe name of _Lúthien_ also appears on the stone of his wife Edith:\n\n    EDITH MARY TOLKIEN Lúthien 1889 – 1971\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn the earliest version of the legendarium, Beren was going to be human,\nbut Tolkien erased over the original versions and wrote over much of the\ntext. The details of the original version of the story are little\nknown.\n\nIn the written draft, and published version Beren was changed to a GNOME\n(a Ñoldorin Elf), son of Egnor (which might have been an early name for\nAegnor). According to _Beren and Lúthien_ Egnor and Egnor (Aegnor)\nare two separate persons. It treats Barahir and Egnor bo-Rimion as two\nseparate persons (there is no explanation given, other than his father\nchanged concepts of Beren's race over time). But due to Christopher's\nplan to avoid too much editorial influence, he doesn't 'fix' or edit\nBeren's race to be consistent between different chapters of the story,\nbut retains whatever race his father had used at the time of wring each\nsection of the story for what he considers the 'continuous and\nstandalone story' derived from all the sources.\n\nSome of the artwork included in the book (all of which is drawn by Alan\nLee) seems to reflect Beren's interchanging Elven ancestry - in\nparticular the cover artwork, which appears to portray a scene from The\nTale of Tinúviel with Beren, Lúthien, and Huan."

During this time, Bilbo grew fond of his life as a wealthy\nbachelor and acquired a reputation for respectability that the neighbors\nadmired.\n\nQuest of Erebor\n\nAn Unexpected Journey\n\nIn the year TA 2941, Bilbo, at the age of 50, was visited by Gandalf and\nthirteen dwarves (The Unexpected Party), led by Thorin Oakenshield.\nThese Dwarves wished to hire Bilbo as their burglar on their quest to\nreclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Bilbo reluctantly\nagreed to go, and the next morning they set off from _The Green Dragon\nInn_.\n\n\n\nThorin and company traveled through the Lone-lands along high hills and\nbeside castles. After approximately one month, Gandalf disappeared. Oín\nand Gloín failed to make a fire during a rainy night, and Balin spotted\na fire in the distance, which was rare in those regions, and sent Bilbo\nto investigate. At the fire were three Stone-trolls, Tom, Bert, and\nWilliam. Bilbo attempted to snatch something from the trolls to bring\nback to the Dwarves, to show that he was a first class burglar. However,\nhe was caught by William, but he escaped and was helpless to prevent all\nthe dwarves from being captured when they came looking for him.\nFortunately, Gandalf came in the nick of time and saved them all by\nimitating the Trolls' voices and tricking the trolls into arguing with\none another until daybreak, which turned them all to stone. After\nrescuing the party, the wizard led Bilbo and the party to the trolls'\ncave, which the latter used to hide their treasure and shield themselves\nfrom the sun during the daylight hours. In the cave, a number of weapons\nwere found, _Glamdring_ (Beater) and _Orcrist_ (Biter) among them. Bilbo\ntook an Elvish dagger from the trolls' collection, no longer than a\nsmall knife in size, which he would later name _Sting_. He kept it with\nhim for the rest of his adventure, wearing it inside his breeches.\n\nIn June they came to Rivendell. During their visit Bilbo met Elrond, and\nbecame enchanted with the Elves. On midsummer eve Elrond inspected the\nswords of Thorin and Gandalf, and looked at Thrór's Map. Elrond\nexplained that the swords were forged in Gondolin and were named Orcrist\nand Glamdring. When inspecting the map Elrond found Moon letters that\nspoke of the back door of Erebor, which read: _Stand by the grey stone\nwhen the thrush knocks, and the setting sun with the last light of\nDurin's Day will shine upon the keyhole._\n\nDiscovery of the One Ring\n\nBilbo and his companions then travelled from Rivendell and made their\nway to the Misty Mountains. It was here the companions encountered and\nfled from the Great Goblin and his immense forces. Bilbo, unfortunately,\nlost direction during the struggle and fell into a gaping hole within\nthe mountains. Luckily, he survived the fall and crawled his way through\nthe pitch-black tunnel, using his hobbit nose to gain a sense of\ndirection. Bilbo eventually stumbled upon a small ring, but thought\nnothing of it, and put it in his back pocket. Although he did not know\nit, this lost trinket was the One Ring, forged by Sauron many years ago.\nBilbo soon encountered Gollum, who had been in possession of the Ring\nfor over five hundred years. The two challenged each other to a game of\nriddles with the condition that Gollum would show the way out if Bilbo\nwon. However, Gollum was not satisfied with Bilbo's final riddle, and\nwhile mourning his loss, found that his Ring was gone. Gollum then\npaddled back on his boat towards Bilbo, who he then accused of stealing\nhis precious, but Bilbo had vanished.\n\n\n\nGollum, thinking Bilbo had known the way out and was leaving, headed to\nthe exit and was followed by Bilbo. Bilbo was soon reunited with his\ncompanions. Bilbo and the travellers had stopped for the night when\ngoblins and a pack of wargs found them near a patch of pine trees. The\ndwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf climbed up the trees to escape, but the\ngoblins were not going to leave without killing them. They started to\nburn the trees down. The Warg Chieftain was ordering the other wargs\naround when Gandalf picked up a pinecone, and with his magic set it\nablaze in a green fire. He threw it down hitting The Warg Chieftain. It\nrolled around on the ground burning while Gandalf threw more and more\npinecones down. The goblins and wargs fled and the group was rescued by\neagles. When an eagle grabbed Dori, Bilbo had to jump and grab Dori's\nlegs before he was forgotten. This prompted Bilbo to groan “My arms! My\npoor arms,” and Dori to cry, “My legs! My poor legs!” The eagles\neventually took them to their eyrie where they rested and continued\ntheir journey.\n\n\n\nThe group traveled to Beorn's house where they rested, after being\ngruffly taken in by Beorn and his animal servants. Beorn learned their\nstory and gave a large number of provisions to help their quest. Beorn\nalso lent several ponies to be used until the group reached Mirkwood.\nHowever, Beorn did not fully trust the dwarves, so Bilbo saw Beorn\ngiving careful watch to see that his ponies were unharmed. Eventually\nthe company reached Mirkwood, where the ponies were let go (to several\nof the dwarves discontent) and Gandalf left the group as well, warning\nthem, “Do not stray off the path.”\n\nThe Company began to follow the path through the treacherous forest.\nEventually the provisions ran low and the Company was forced to send\nBilbo up a tree to see where the forest ended. Bilbo climbed up a tree,\nwhere a rewarding breeze of cool air and butterflies met him. Bilbo only\nsaw more forest, so when he reluctantly climbed back down, he did not\nsee that the forest ended. He reported his findings to the dwarves,\nwhere they met the news with ill comfort, angry that the dwarves were\nfatter than Bilbo and so could not climb the trees to feel cool air or\nsee the butterflies. Eventually the last provisions were eaten. The\nCompany then came upon the Enchanted River. Bilbo saw a boat on the\nother side, leading the dwarves to retrieve it. A deer came out of\nnowhere when all the dwarves were on the other side. A dwarf shot it\nwhere it died, on the other side. The dwarves hoped for venison for\ndinner when Bilbo realized that Bombur was drowning. The dwarves fished\nhim out, where he was asleep, but the boat was knocked away, ending the\nhope for venison.\n\nWhile wandering down the path, the dwarves saw lights in the forest.\nDeciding that they would rather leave the path than starve to death they\nheaded after the lights. As soon as they got to the lights, they went\nout and one of their party fell asleep. This happened twice. On the\nthird time all of them fell asleep.\n\n\n\nWhen Bilbo awoke in the night, he was alone. He cursed the dwarves for\nleaving the path and discovered that spiders had captured his\ncompanions. Bilbo was forced to find his lost companions and cut through\nthe cocoons the spiders had formed around his companions. He distracted\nthe spiders by improvising several insulting songs to irritate the\nspiders, who left their domain to find the insulter and eat him. Bilbo\nkilled a few by throwing stones at a few spiders and he killed more via\nSting. They never found him, since he used the Ring to turn invisible.\nAfter freeing the dwarves, he led them into a charge against the\nspiders, where Bilbo killed dozens of the arachnids with the help of the\nRing and Sting.\n\nAfter traveling through Mirkwood Forest the dwarves were taken prisoner\nby Wood-elves, who believed that the company had “assaulted” the elves\nwhile they were partying (the bright lights the company had seen in the\nforest). Bilbo avoided being caught by using his ring to stay invisible,\nand followed them into the halls of the elf-king where they were held\ncaptive. Eventually Bilbo was able to rescue the dwarves and soon they\nall arrived at Lake Town, a small town occupied by men where Smaug would\nfrequently attack, though he had not been seen in many years. The group\nsearched the mountainside until they found the secret door. Bilbo alone\nwas sent in to steal some treasure from Smaug. When he arrived, Smaug\nwas awake and sensed his presence. Bilbo put on the ring so as to avoid\nbeing noticed.\n\nSmaug tried to figure out who or what Bilbo was, but Bilbo would not\ntell Smaug his true identity, answering Smaug's questions only in\nriddles. While invisible, Bilbo saw that Smaug had a bare spot on his\njewel-encrusted underbelly. Finally, Bilbo removed the ring and Smaug\nsaw that he had stolen a cup, causing him to go into a terrible rage.\nAfter Bilbo made it out of Smaug's lair safely, the dragon flew off to\nLaketown. Bilbo told a thrush to send word to Bard of Smaug's weakness.\nBard shot the Black Arrow at the bare spot, killing Smaug and sending\nhim to rot at the bottom of the lake, but destroying part of Lake Town.\n\nBattle of Five Armies and aftermath\n\nIn Lake Town, after Thorin Oakenshield reclaimed the mountain, the\nBattle of the Five Armies took place. Beorn, the Beorning chieftain,\njoined the travellers in their fight against an army of orcs. After the\nbattle, Bilbo found Thorin lying on a bed, dying. Thorin praised Bilbo\nand apologized to him for cursing him earlier.\n\nAfter Thorin's funeral, Dain offered him his one-fourteenth share of the\ntreasure, but Bilbo declined, receiving only two small chests, one with\ngold, and the other laden with silver. Bilbo traveled back with the\nwood-elf host that participated in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo\ntraveled with the wood-elves down to Mirkwood, and then went to Beorn's\nhouse with Gandalf. Then Bilbo set out with Gandalf to where Bert, Tom,\nand William had turned to stone. They dug up some of the buried treasure\nthe dwarves had buried earlier, most of which Bilbo offered to Gandalf\nto use to aid the peoples of Middle-Earth. Bilbo eventually made it back to Hobbiton, where he\nfound an auction taking place in which his relatives, the\nSackville-Bagginses, believing him dead, were selling most of his\npossessions to the other hobbits. The Sackville-Bagginses were vexed to\nsee Bilbo alive, since they wanted to live in Bag End themselves. Bilbo\nhad to buy back his sold possessions in order to avoid quarreling with\nthem. Eventually, Balin and Gandalf visited him, where they reported the\ncurrent news of Middle-earth.\n\nReturn in the Shire\n\nAlthough Bilbo returned safely to Bag End with his reward and lived in\nrelative comfort, Bilbo’s life was not quite the same as it had once\nbeen. His sudden return after having been thought dead lost him some of\nthe neighbors’ respect and he was later thought of as an oddity, and\nthere was much talk and false rumors circulated about his affairs and\ndoings. The worst of these problems came from the Sackville-Bagginses,\nwho were angry that they were not able to possess Bag End when he was\nthought to be dead. This jealousy and anger increased when Bilbo adopted\nhis nephew Frodo (a Brandybuck) as his heir apparent.\n\nBilbo ignored these things said about him and avoided the\nSackville-Bagginses as much as he could, even using the Ring once to\nhide from them. Bilbo was very generous with his money and most people\nwere willing to forgive him his oddities. He had many friends especially\namongst the Gamgees whom he consulted frequently on landscaping and on\nthe growing of vegetables. His good friend The Gaffer even allowed him\nto tutor his son Samwise Gamgee. Bilbo taught him to read and write, and\nat some point taught him various bits of poetry and told him tales of\nthe elder days. Yet, he slowly began to become weary of his settled and\nsheltered life at Bag End.\n\n\n\nBilbo was the bearer of the One Ring for six decades, ignorant of its\nsignificance. However, by TA 3001, the Ring had begun to affect him. He\ndid not appear to have aged at all, although he felt older and thin\ninside. He decided that he wanted to partake in one more adventure,\nbefore he found a place to settle down and finish his account of the\nQuest for the Lonely Mountain.\n\n\n\nOn September 22, a farewell Birthday Party was held in his honour, where\nhe announced his intention to leave the Shire, to the shock of his\nfamily and friends. Immediately afterwards, he put on his ring and\ndisappeared, as a joke on his neighbours. He returned to his house where\nhe was confronted by his friend Gandalf, who tried to persuade him to\nleave the ring for Frodo. Bilbo initially agreed, but then became\nhostile and accused Gandalf of trying to steal the ring for his own\nbenefit, which he referred to as his “precious.” Horrified by Bilbo's\noutburst, Gandalf stood to his full height and ordered Bilbo to leave it\nbehind. Immediately Bilbo returned to his senses, apologising and\nadmitting that the Ring had been troubling him lately. After a moment of\ninner struggle, Bilbo finally dropped the ring to the ground, becoming\nthe first ring-bearer to give up the ring on his own will. Bilbo and\nGandalf bade each other goodbye, and Bilbo left the Shire for his\njourney.\n\nOn the same day, Bilbo left the One Ring and his home of Bag End in the\npossession of his relative, Frodo Baggins who was eager to be his own\nmaster despite the loss of Bilbo, for he was not yet ready to leave the\nShire. After his departure, Bilbo wandered to Rivendell and then, after\na rest, accompanied some dwarves to Dale, before returning to Rivendell.\n\nLife in Rivendell\n\n\n\nBetween TA 3003 and TA 3018, Bilbo worked on the written account of his\nadventures, in a book that would later be known as the _Red Book of\nWestmarch_. He also studied the Elvish language and compiled a\nthree-volume history of the Elder Days, which he called _Translations\nfrom the Elvish_. He composed the poem _All that is Gold Does Not\nGlitter_ for Aragorn as well as a much longer poem about Eärendil during\nhis stay at Rivendell.\n\nIn October 3018, Frodo arrived at Rivendell. Bilbo learnt that his\nnephew was on a quest to destroy the One Ring so he gave him the sword\nSting and for protection his mithril shirt. However, he remained in\nRivendell while Frodo travelled south. After Frodo returned, Bilbo had\nnoticeably aged, partially freed from the Ring's effect, although he\ncontinued to desire it.\n\n\n\nSince Bilbo had been a ring-bearer, he was allowed to accompany Frodo to\nthe Undying Lands. On September 22, 3021, Bilbo turned 131, and became\nthe oldest Hobbit in Middle-earth (unless Sméagol is counted to have\nremained a Hobbit). On September 29, he, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel and\nFrodo boarded a ship docked at the Grey Havens and sailed away from\nMiddle-earth. His fate afterwards is not known but as he too was a\nmortal being, he most likely died in the light of the Blessed Realm of\nValinor.\n\n\nCharacter\n\n\n\nBilbo was a very friendly and well-mannered hobbit fond of food, drink,\na full pipe, his friends and good cheer, and was known for greeting\nstrangers and friends with hospitality saying; “At your service and your\nfamilies”. Being related to both the Tooks and the Baggins two family\ngroups that were fundamentally opposite in their mentalities, with the\nTooks being more fond of adventures and wandering, and the Baggins who\nwere more fond of the settled life, Bilbo had two different sides to\nhim, something he referred to as the “Took side” and the “Baggins side”.\nThis meant that he secretly relished having adventures but still wanted\nto remain settled and was very afraid.\nBilbo seemed to be happy with his life at Bag End, and would have been\ncontent to remain a child of his father, had adventure not come upon\nhim. Still very afraid and wishing he had never left his hobbit-hole,\nthe Took side eventually won out, even after he returned home to his old\nlife. Thus, his desire for another adventure never truly departed from\nhim in his heart even into his old age. This he demonstrated in his\nsudden departure from Bag End in TA 3001.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nOther names\n\n-   Bur-a-hobbit\n-   The Barrel Rider\n-   Burglar\n-   Thief in the Shadows\n-   Child of the kindly West\n-   Clue-finder\n-   Guest of Eagles\n-   The Lucky Number\n-   Luckwearer\n-   Old Mad Baggins\n-   The Ring Winner\n-   The Spider Stinger\n-   Stinging Fly\n-   He that walks unseen\n-   Mr. Boggins\n-   The Web Cutter\n\nEarlier names\n\n-   Bilba Labingi, the original hobbit name for Bilbo\n\n\nBilbo's writings\n\n\n\nTranslations\n\n-   _Translations from the Elvish_\n-   _The Fall of Gil-galad_\n\nComposed works\n\n-   _There and Back Again_\n-   _The Road Goes Ever On_\n-   _All that is Gold Does Not Glitter_\n-   _Song of Eärendil_\n-   _The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late_\n-   _A Walking Song_ (Wrote the lyrics)\n-   _Warning of Winter_\n-   _Bilbo's Last Song_\n\n\nAppearances in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Hobbit_ (First appearance)\n-   _The Lord of the Rings_\n-   _The Silmarillion_\n-   _Unfinished Tales_\n\nIn the films\n\n-   _An Unexpected Journey_\n-   _The Desolation of Smaug_\n-   _The Battle of the Five Armies_\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_ (Mentioned only)\n-   _The Return of the King_\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film trilogy\n\nIn Peter Jackson's Film Trilogy, an old Bilbo Baggins is portrayed by\nIan Holm.\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\nBilbo Baggins is portrayed by Martin Freeman and Ian Holm for Peter\nJackson's The Hobbit trilogy."

    "text": "BOFUR was a Dwarf of the late-Third Age. He is best known for being\ncompanions to Bilbo Baggins, Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf on the quest\nto reclaim Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, along with his brother\nBombur and cousin Bifur.\n\n\nBiography\n\nBofur was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, but was not of\nDurin's Folk. He and his family hailed from the Blue Mountains. As such,\nthey felt less strongly about the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain\nfrom the dragon Smaug, more interested in the adventure than a home\nthey'd never seen.\n\nBofur's family were miners, and he and his cousin Bifur also dabbled in\ntoy-making, crafting the wonderful mechanical toys that were so famous\nin Dale. Life in the Blue Mountains was difficult, but Bofur remained\ncheerfully optimistic, with a love of mince pies, cheese, and music - he\nplayed the clarinet. Bofur maintained a close but feisty relationship\nwith his brother Bombur whom he often teased but always looked after.\n\nQuest to Erebor\n\nWhile answering Thorin Oakenshield's quest to Erebor, Bofur went to the\nmeeting at Bag End with his brother Bombur and cousin Bifur. Bofur later\nexplains to Bilbo about Smaug, for which Bilbo faints afterwards,\nprompting Gandalf to sarcastically say “thanks a lot, Bofur”. After the\ncompany left Bag End, and Bilbo realized he had forgotten his\nhankerchief, Bofur tossed him a wet rag, causing many of the other\nDwarves to laugh. Once the company had reached Rivendell, Bofur tossed\nhis brother Bombur a sausage, causing the bench he was sitting on to\nbreak, causing all the Dwarves to break out in laughter. When Bilbo was\ngoing to leave to Rivendell, Bofur attempted to convince him not to,\nhowever, realizing that Bilbo was truly homesick, he wished him the best\nof luck. however, Bofur pointed out to Bilbo that Sting was glowing.\nBofur can later be seen fighting Orcs, and later fighting Orcs and Wargs\nalong with the rest of the company. \n\n\nLater life\n\nNothing is known about his life after the Battle of Five Armies. He may\nhave lived into the early Fourth Age.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\n\n\nRankin-Bass\n\nBofur was voiced by Jack DeLeon in the 1977 animated film “The Hobbit”.\n\nThe Hobbit trilogy\n\n\n\nIn the live action Hobbit film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, Bofur\nis played by James Nesbitt. Bofur has an expanded role in the film\ncompared to the book, serving as lookout when the company was resting in\nthe Misty Mountains and captured by the Orcs. He gave Bilbo words of\nencouragement just before their capture when the latter was about to\nleave to return to Rivendell, wishing him good luck. However, they were\ncaptured before Bilbo could leave. At Bag End he played a flute, rather\nthan a clarinet as stated in the book. He carries a mattock in Peter\nJackson's films.\n\nThe studio released the following information about Bofur in the newly\nreleased and upcoming films:\n\n  _“Endearing and likable, Bofur has a disastrous tendency to state the\n  obvious and blurt out things without thinking. With a love of music\n  and a fine singing voice, Bofur delights in good food and good company\n  and is unfailingly optimistic. Though not especially brave, he will do\n  his best to help those in need, especially those he counts as friends.\n  Along with his brother Bombur and his cousin Bifur, Bofur joined the\n  Quest for the Lonely Mountain partly to seek his fortune – and partly\n  because he was told the beer was free.”_\n\nIn _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_, due to excessive partying the\nnight before, Bofur oversleeps and is left behind in Lake-town when\nThorin and Company leave for the Lonely Mountain, except for Fíli, Kíli\nand Óin, who have stayed behind as well because Kíli has become gravely\nill from a poisoned orc arrow. In the evening, Kíli's wound grows worse\nand the Dwarves take refuge in Bard's home. Óin asks Bard if there is\nany Kingsfoil, which he knows to have healing properties. Bard says it's\na weed they use to feed the pigs, so Bofur sets off to get some.\nMeanwhile, Bolg and a group of orcs arrive in Lake-town, searching for\nThorin. Unintentionally, Bofur leads them to Bard's home and the orcs\nattack. Legolas and Tauriel arrive just in time to kill the orcs. When\nBofur returns with the Kingsfoil, Tauriel uses it to tend to Kíli's\nwounds as Fíli, Oin and Bofur watch. In _The Hobbit: The Battle of the\nFive Armies_, the four Dwarves are present when Smaug attacks Lake-town,\nafter which they travel by boat to the Lonely Mountain, to rejoin the\nrest of the company.

Fatty was a descendant of Hildibrand Took (TA\n2849 - TA 2934), one of the many sons of the Gerontius Took. He was the\nson of Odovacar Bolger and Rosamunda Took. Fatty was born in TA 2980.\n\nHe had a younger sister, ESTELLA (TA 2985 - ?), who married Meriadoc\nBrandybuck.\n\n\nHistory\n\n Fatty, along with Folco Boffin, Sam, Merry\nand Pippin is one of Frodo Baggins's friends, and helped move his things\nfrom Bag End to his new home at Crickhollow. There, he and Merry welcome\nFrodo, Sam and Pippin when those three arrive from Bucklebury.\n\nWhen Frodo and the rest set out to take the Ring to Rivendell, Fredegar\nstayed behind at Crickhollow in an attempt to keep up appearances and\ndelay news of their departure. He was frightened half out of his wits by\nthe arrival of the Nazgûl but escaped unharmed. Fredegar could have gone\nwith Frodo and his companions into the Old Forest, but was terrified of\nthe stories about it. Though Merry tried to persuade him that the Old\nForest would be nothing compared to meeting the Ringwraiths, Fatty was\nadamant, so the other Hobbits went into the forest with only the\nknowledge of Merry to aid them. Soon while Frodo and his other friends\nleft Fatty stayed to make Frodo seem like he hadn't left. Then on\nSeptember the 30th Fredegard was attacked by Nazgûl and ran to the\nnearest house and raised the Horn-call of Buckland and so the Nazgûl\nleft.\n\nDuring Saruman's rule of the Shire he led a group of partisans fighting\nagainst the Ruffians around the Hills of Scary, before eventually being\ncaptured. He and his sons were imprisoned in the Lockholes and starved,\nmeaning that after his release nobody could call him Fatty any more.\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nIn earlier drafts of _The Lord of the Rings_ Fatty Bolger played a much\nlarger role, but this was later abandoned. His role survives as a minor\nanomaly in the book — before the Hobbits go into the Old Forest, they\nhave five ponies prepared — but only take four. Bolger was originally\nsupposed to go with them.\n\nIt might be argued that Fredegar Bolger is the least heralded but\nperhaps the most significant of all the heroes of the War of the Rings:\nby delaying the Nazgul just slightly, he may well have turned the whole\ncourse of the War in favor of the West away from Sauron.... and for his\nheroism is starved in the Lockholes.\n\n\n\nSMALL APPEARANCE IN THE MOVIE\n\nIn the extended edition of the Fellowship of the Ring, there is a brief\nclip of Bilbo greeting Fatty Bolger, however, they do not show his face,\nand the clip is very brief. Some minutes later he appears again,\ncheering as Bilbo shouts his name. Though it is not confirmed that the\nhobbit cheering was Fatty, it is likely, as his appearance is very\nsimilar to that of the Fatty Bolger Bilbo greeted."

    "race": "Dwarf",
    "text": "'''Bombur '''was a Dwarf who accompanies Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo\nBaggins on their journey to the Lonely Mountain. His brother Bofur and\ncousin Bifur also were part of the company.\n\n\nBiography\n\nBombur's parentage is unknown; the only familial connections mentioned\nare his brother Bofur and his cousin Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's\nline although he was descended from Dwarves of Moria. His birth year is\nalso unknown, however, from Bilbo Baggins' account from the quest to\nErebor it is known that the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of\nthe 13 “by some fifty years” and that after Thorin had been captured,\nBalin was “the eldest left”. Since Fíli was born in TA 2859 and Balin\nwas born in TA 2763, this would put Bombur's birth between 2763 and\n2809, and he would have been between 132 and 178 years old during the\nquest to Erebor. Prior to the quest Bombur probably lived in the Blue\nMountains with Thorin after the loss of Thráin II.\n\nThe Quest for Erebor\n\n\n\nBombur is the twelfth Dwarf to arrive at Bag End. Because he counts for\ntwo, he is the last to enter Beorn's house and the last to cross the\nEnchanted river in Mirkwood. Bombur is first introduced when he tumbles\nwith Bifur and Bofur onto Thorin when they enter Bag End, and he also is\nknocked into the Enchanted river (and falls asleep). He chooses to stay\nand guard the camp, and supplies while the others move up the Lonely\nMountain because he trusts neither mountain paths nor ropes. Later\nthough, he is forced to use the ropes to escape the rampaging dragon\nSmaug.\n\nBombur sleeps at several key moments in the book. When he is violently\nknocked into the Mirkwood River by an aggressive stag, he falls under a\nspell that makes him sleep for days, burdening the others with his\nweight as they walked on. While he is on a midnight lookout in the\nfortified Lonely Mountain, Bilbo promises to keep watch so that he can\nsleep a bit longer and take another watch later (Bilbo used this\nopportunity to sneak the Arkenstone out of the mountain). Incidentally,\nhe was asleep when they opened his barrel after escaping the Elves of\nMirkwood and also when Bilbo discovered the secret entrance to Lonely\nMountain. Bombur is always last and doesn't enjoy it. When the Dwarves,\nGandalf, and Bilbo meet Beorn, Bombur comes last. He comes along\nstraight after Bifur and Bofur so he won't be last. He fought at and\nsurvived the Battle of the Five Armies. Following the defeat of Smaug,\nDain II Ironfoot gave him his share of the treasure and he remained to\nlive at the Lonely Mountain.\n\nLater Years\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings_, many years later, Frodo Baggins inquires\nafter Bombur and learns that he has grown so fat it takes several\nDwarves to lift him to the dinner table. It is unlikely that Bombur\nfought in the Battle of Dale due to his over weight.\n\n\nWeapons and abilities\n\nIn Peter Jackson's Hobbit film trilogy, Bombur can be seen using a\nnumber of different weapons and tools to fight off enemies. His primary\nweapon is an iron ladle, which he wields during _An Unexpected Journey_.\nHe also uses a cleaver or butcher's knife to slash enemies. In _The\nDesolation of Smaug_, he uses the same weapons but usually wields an\naxe. Of course, his greatest weapon is his size which he uses to crush\nand bounce away opponents. Bombur and his family are not classically\ntrained fighters but are lethal with any sort of tool in their hands.\n\nHe also is surprisingly agile for a dwarf of his size and weight. He is\nvery capable of performing stunts such as when, in the second film, he\npole vaults into a barrel. He has an astonishing degree of durability,\nand can withstand a hard landing on a great number of Orcs, and also\nabsorbs an incredible amount of momentum in the process, without\nbreaking a limb or causing himself any visible degree of injury. In\naddition, he is a quick thinker and uses his ingenuity frequently to\nhelp push past Orcs or leap across gaps.\n\n\nPortrayal in Adaptations\n\nThe Hobbit film (1977)\n\nIn the animated version of _The Hobbit_, he plays the most major role in\nThorin's company besides Balin and Dori. Unlike in the book, he was\nkilled during the Battle of the Five Armies. He was voiced by Paul\nFrees.\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\n\n\nIn Peter Jackson's live-action The Hobbit films, he was portrayed by\nStephen Hunter. In 2012, the studio released the following statement\nabout Bombur in the upcoming trilogy:\n\n_Brother to Bofur and cousin to Bifur, Bombur is the chief cook amongst\nThe Company of Dwarves. His immense size and voracious appetite causes\nfrequent problems – and laughter – for himself and The Traveling Party.\nDespite his size he can be surprisingly effective as a fighter – and woe\nbetide anyone who makes him late for dinner!_\n\nUnlike in the book, Bombur appears less frequently and has virtually no\ndialogue in the films other than grunts or retorts. In the extended\nedition of the third film, he speaks after the ax in Bifur's head is\nremoved. Throughout the films he is largely a source of comic relief,\nmost of which pertains to his size and love of eating; such as catching\nfood in midair, being able to outrun his fellow Dwarves despite his\ngirth, exceptional fighting skills, even under duress, breaking a table\nunder his own weight with the addition of merely an ounce of food in his\nhand.\n\nBombur also appeared as an ally card in the Lord Of The Rings card game,\nby Fantasy Flight games. He belonged to the Spirit sphere and his effect\nallowed the player to use him straight from their hand to do nothing but\ncommit to a quest, ignoring the recourse typically used to pay for ally\ncards, for one turn. Assuming the player did not let Bombur be killed\nduring that turn, the effect could be used over and over again.\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nAccording to _The History of The Hobbit_ by John D. Rateliff, in the\nnever completed third revision of _The Hobbit_, Bombur, along with Bifur\nand Bofur were to become something like an honour-guard to Thorin. Such\na change is already supported in several places of the book, including\nthe fact that Bifur, Bofur and Bombur all arrive at Bag End at the same\ntime as Thorin, and that they climb into the same tree as him when the\ncompany is attacked by Wargs and Goblins."

    "text": "BOROMIR was a valiant warrior known in Gondor for his greatness, having\nalready achieved great merit in Gondor prior to the Council of Elrond.\nHe is the eldest son of Denethor II, who was Steward of Gondor during\nthe War of the Ring, and his wife Finduilas. Even the people of Rohan\nadmired him, particularly Éomer. He is the older brother of Faramir.\n\n\nBiography\n\nBefore the War of the Ring\n\n\n\nBoromir was born in the year TA 2978. He was the eldest child of\nDenethor II (the penultimate Steward of Gondor) and his wife Finduilas,\nand would have taken over as Steward after Denethor's death, had he\nlived. When Boromir was only ten years old, his mother died.\nConsequently, his father became a grim person and visibly preferred\nBoromir over his brother, Faramir. Despite this fact, Boromir looked\nafter his younger brother and they became very close. Boromir devoted\nhimself to leading his people and fought in the battle for the eastern\npart of Osgiliath. He, his brother, and two others were the only\nsurvivors of the unit that held the bridge until its destruction; they\nhad to swim the river Anduin to reach safety.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nBoromir, by order of his father, Denethor, set out from Minas Tirith to\nRivendell to decipher a riddle that was given to him and his brother in\ntheir dreams:\n\n    _Seek for the Sword that was broken,_\n    _In Imladris it dwells,_\n    _There shall be counsels taken,_\n    _Stronger than Morgul-spells._\n    _There shall be shown a token,_\n    _That Doom is near at hand,_\n    _For Isildur's Bane shall waken,_\n    _And the Halfling forth shall stand._\n\nBoromir lost his horse in Tharbad and travelled the rest of the way on\nfoot. The journey took 110 days. He arrived at the beginning of the\nCouncil of Elrond where he talked about how Gondor was defending itself\nfrom Mordor and tried to convince them to give the One Ring to Gondor\nwhere he felt it would be kept safe. But the council disagreed with the\nOne Ring's being taken to Gondor, deciding that the only safe course was\nto destroy it.\n\nBoromir joined the Fellowship of the Ring and was warned by Elrond to\nnot blow the Horn of Gondor until they were close to Gondor and in dire\nneed. He proved his worth as a capable warrior in the Mines of Moria,\nand assisted Aragorn in fighting off a large number of orcs and goblins.\nAfter the loss of Gandalf and the Fellowship's departure of Moria,\nBoromir expressed opposition to Aragorns decision to continue to Lorien,\nargueing that to go south was better. He believed that stories told in\nGondor of the Galadriel's magic would harm them. He eventually agreed to\ngo after Aragorn assured him the elves would help them. In Lothlórien,\nBoromir was disturbed by what he felt was Galadriel's testing of his\nmind, and he was suspicious of her motives. Before leaving Lothlórien\nhe was given the gift of an elven-cloak and a golden belt.\n\nBoromir disliked the idea of destroying the One Ring, as he believed\nthat it could be used to defeat Sauron once and for all, to save Gondor,\nand return it to its former glory; he tried to convince Frodo to give\nhim the Ring. When Frodo refused, Boromir tried to take it by force but\nthe hobbit put it on and fled.\n\nAfter Boromir realized his actions were caused by the corruption of the\nOne Ring, he repented, and upon returning to camp he was confronted by\nAragorn about Frodo. Boromir told Aragorn that he had seen Frodo an hour\nago where he had tried to convince Frodo to bring the One Ring to Minas\nTirith. They then had an argument and Frodo walked off. After the\nargument Boromir went for a walk, until eventually returning to the\ncamp. The Fellowship, especially Aragorn, believed that there was more\nto the confrontation than Boromir was telling them, but Aragorn did not\npress the issue. Upon hearing of Frodo's predicament, the rest of the\nFellowship, particularly the Hobbits, scattered in an ill-concieved\nattempt to find him. Aragorn ordered Boromir to follow and look after\nMerry and Pippin while he took off after Sam.\n\nDuring the search, Merry and Pippin ran into a group of Uruk-Hai,\nwho tried to capture them. Boromir came to their aid and drove the orcs\noff, but more orcs came and Boromir was mortally wounded by many arrows.\nAragorn found him dying under a tree, with Merry and Pippin gone. He\nstayed with Boromir until he died from his wounds.\n\nAragorn, Legolas, and Gimli laid his body inside one of the boats of\nLórien, and sent him down the Falls of Rauros. Afterwards, they sang the\nLament for Boromir.\n\nLegacy\n\n\n\nThree days after Boromir's death, his brother Faramir saw his funeral\nboat passing down the Anduin. Men of Gondor found Boromir's horn, the\nHorn of Gondor, broken in twain, and brought it to his father. This\ndrove Denethor to despair, and when compounded with Faramir's later\nseemingly-mortal wounding and his knowledge of Mordor's indomitable\nmight, he lost his mind. Many, including Faramir, often lamented\nBoromir's passing as Sauron readied his forces to attack, noting that\nhis loss would be keenly felt by Gondor on the field of battle.\n\nBoromir won respect even from his enemies: in _The Two Towers_, Ugluk\nboasts that it was the Uruk-hai who “slew the mighty warrior,” a clear\nreference to Boromir.\n\n\nPersonality\n\nBoromir was above all else exceedingly valiant and steadfast, and was\nheld in great esteem by the fighting men of many nations. He was noted\nas being somewhat dissimilar in manner and thought from both his father,\nDenethor, and his brother Faramir, but he loved them both greatly. He\nwas selfless and bold, but he took little interest in the books and\nscrolls that his brother so often read, having little interest in lore.\nIt was said of him by Éomer that he had a great deal in common with the\npeople of Rohan. However, his desire to protect his people, and his\ninability to do so, left him vulnerable to the predations of the One\nRing. This eventually caused him to attempt to take it from Frodo,\nthough he deeply regretted this almost immediately after it occurred. At\none point, when envisioning he would have hoped to achieve if he took\nthe One Ring and overthrew Sauron, his world after Sauron's defeat was\none of peace and security, where he used the Ring to rule with wisdom\nand generosity.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\n_The Lord of the Rings_ film trilogy\n\n  Boromir\nis portrayed by the English actor Sean Bean in Peter Jackson's trilogy\nas a brave and skilled warrior whose loyalty to Gondor tempts him to\ntake the Ring for himself. He first appears in _The Fellowship of the\nRing_ at the Council of Elrond, where he suggests that Gondor use the\nOne Ring as a weapon against Sauron. Although he squabbles with Aragorn\nover the kingship of Gondor, he joins the Fellowship of the Ring when it\nassembles. As the Fellowship travels toward Lórien, Boromir proves his\nworth as a fighter but continues to be tempted by the Ring. When the\ngroup arrives at Caras Galadhon, Galadriel speaks to him telepathically\nof the fall of Gondor.\n\nAt the end of the first film, Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo\nas Saruman's Uruk-hai attack the Fellowship. Frodo escapes by using the\nRing, and Boromir dies defending Merry and Pippin from the orcs. As he\npasses, he apologizes to Aragorn and acknowledges Aragorn's birthright\nto the throne of men. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli then lay his body in a\nrowboat that floats down the Anduin, as in the books.\n\nBoromir only appears in the extended editions of _The Two Towers_ and\n_The Return of the King_. In _The Two Towers_, he appears in Faramir's\nflashback of the Battle of Osgiliath. Boromir and Faramir lead a host of\nGondorian soldiers in liberating the city, and Boromir gives a patriotic\nspeech. Denethor arrives and instructs Boromir to travel to Rivendell\nand bring back the One Ring. In this sequence, Boromir is portrayed as\ntrying to balance his love for his younger brother and country with his\ngoal of doing his father's will.\n\nIn _The Return of the King_, he appears briefly in one of Denethor's\nhallucinations.\n\nBoromir is known for two famous movie lines that have been the spark of\nmany internet memes; “They have a cave troll,” and “One does not simply\nwalk into Mordor.”\n\nNon-canonical weapons\n\n-   Armor\n\nBoromir's armor was the standard armor of a Gondor foot soldier. When\ntravelling with the Fellowship of the Ring, Boromir was more lightly\narmored, wearing only chain-mail, leather and a well-made pair of Gondor\nvambraces later worn by Aragorn.\n\nBoromir is also mentioned as having a helmet, but it makes no appearance\nexcept once, when Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are arraying him for\nburial.\n\n-   Shield\n\nThe shield that Boromir carried was circular, unique\nby its design, and easily recognizable.\n\nThe wood frame had been dyed black, and in the middle was a large steel\nboss that was riveted to the back of the shield; fixed into the boss was\na handle made of horn that was edged with bronze rings. Around the edge\nwere engraved wings and the seven stars of Gondor's noble heritage. When\nnot using it, Boromir carried the shield over his shoulder with the\nfinely tooled leather gauge that was riveted to the boss and the steel\nrim that ran around the edge of the shield, again secured by a number of\nrivets.\n\nIt was a solid piece of work that could be wielded quickly and\neffectively; the curved, circular shield had no points that an enemy\ncould catch on, so their blows would slide across and past the shield.\nWhen this happened, the attacker's forward movement would unbalance him,\nallowing Boromir to bring his sword down upon his out-thrust and exposed\narm and neck. If the blow was light enough, the upraised shield would\narrest the swing of the blow and Boromir could thrust under the foe's\nshield and into his belly.\n\n-   Sword\n\n\n\nBoromir's sword was like its owner: big, broad, and powerful. To use it\nsingle-handed required someone with great strength in the arm and wrist,\nboth of which this skilled warrior had in abundance. It is a hand and a\nhalf sword meaning Boromir could wield it with one hand allowing him to\nuse his shield and as a two handed sword. The blade was over three\ninches across at its widest point; it had a flattened diamond shape in\nsection with an equally wide fuller in order to keep the weight down.\nHowever, the fuller ended some way short if the tip, thereby keeping as\nmuch strength in the end of the blade as possible. It was sharpened on\nboth edges and tapered actually at the tip, which meant that it would\nhave been equally effective for slashing against lightly armoured\nopponents.\n\nThe guard was the same shape as that on his father’s sword, as well as\nthose on all Third Age Gondor-made swords. The handgrip was wide like\nthe blade, matched to Boromir's hand, and the scent-stopper pommel was\nan elegant and simple piece of steel, again large to counterbalance the\nweight of this warrior's blade. The scabbard was wood covered in leather\nthat had been decorated with crisscrossing strips of leather down its\nlength together with a steel locket and an elegant steel shape that\nmatched the shape of the pommel. It was attached directly to the belt\nthat had been stamped with a delicate leaf pattern repeated along its\nlength. It may be that this was a gift from his mother.\n\n-   Dagger\n\nBoromir also carried a dagger that was a little brother to his sword,\nmatching its blade shape and pommel design. The only difference was that\nit was decorated with bronze details; the handgrip was wrapped in fine\nbronze wire instead of leather, the pommel was gilded with bronze and\nthe guard was formed from a single piece of shaped bronze. Unusual for a\ndagger, the wide blade was fuller so that in all respects it resembled\nthe tip of Boromir's sword. In the movie it is last seen when he throws\nit into the neck of an Uruk-hai who was attempting to attack Merry and\nPippin from behind.\n\nWithin Ralph Bakshi's film\n\n In Ralph Bakshi's film, Boromir was portrayed by\nthe English voice actor Michael Graham Cox in which the character has on\na helmet that resembles a stereotypical viking's with two horns on each\nside.\n\nRadio plays\n\nIn the 1955 BBC play, he was portrayed by the British voice actor Derek\nPrentice. In the Mind's Eye 1979 play, he was portrayed by the American\nvoice actor Erik Bauersfeld. In the final BBC radio play of 1981, he was\nagain voiced by Michael Graham Cox.\n\nVideo games\n\n-   Boromir appears in the _LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game_,\n    voiced by Sean Bean.\n-   He also makes an appearance in an online multiplayer game _The Lord\n    of the Rings Online_.\n-   Boromir is a playable hero in the real-time strategy _Battle for\n    Middle-earth_ series.\n-   Boromir is a playable character via DLC in The Lord of the Rings:\n    Conquest."

He loved boats and ponies and had a great interest\nin the maps of Middle-earth. He was also one of the nine companions in\nThe Fellowship of the Ring.\n\n\nBiography\n\nMerry was born in TA 2982. He was the only child of Saradoc Brandybuck\n(TA 2940 - FO 11), Master of Buckland, and Esmeralda Took (TA 2936 - ?),\nthe younger sister of Paladin Took II , making him first cousin to\nPaladin's son Pippin, who was clearly his closest friend.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nMerry was considered the most perceptive and intelligent of the hobbits,\nfor example, even before Frodo Baggins leaves the Shire, he knew of the\nOne Ring and its power. He guarded Bag End after Bilbo's party,\nprotecting Frodo from the various and often unwanted guests. He also was\nthe force behind “the Conspiracy” of Sam, Pippin, Fredegar Bolger (more\ncommonly known as “Fatty”, due to his plump form) and himself to help\nFrodo. Thus, even before the Quest of the Ring begins, Merry was well\nprepared and organized; he assembled their gear and brought ponies. His\nshortcut through the Old Forest served them well, because they avoided\nthe Black Riders and met Tom Bombadil, who helped them. At the\nBarrow-downs, Merry acquired his sword, a work of Westernesse.\n\n\n\nAt Bree, he was not present in the Prancing Pony when Frodo foolishly\nput on the ring; but was outside taking a walk, and was nearly killed by\nthe Nazgûl who arrived. At Rivendell, he was seen studying maps and\nplotting their path. His approval to the Fellowship came with only a\nlittle less reluctance than Pippin's; they were the two to relay news to\nthe people of the Shire about Frodo's journey, but in the end Gandalf,\nbelieving in the friendship and loyalty shown to Frodo and Sam,\nrequested that Elrond allow the two hobbits to come along. At Amon Hen\nhe was captured along with Pippin by a band of Saruman's\nfighting Uruk-hai, but he made a good account for himself, and Boromir\nvaliantly defended him, though Boromir died in the attempt.\n\nEscaping with Pippin into Fangorn Forest, Treebeard and the newly risen\nGandalf the White met him. Along with Pippin, he drank significant\namounts of Entwash, which contributed to speedy gains in height and hair\ngrowth. Accompanying Treebeard to the Entmoot, and later to Isengard, he\nand Pippin were set as guardians following Saruman's fall. It was here\nthat Merry encountered King Théoden of Rohan, and was reunited with the\nremaining members of the Fellowship (save Frodo and Sam).\n\n\n\nSeparated from Pippin when Gandalf took the latter to Gondor, Merry\nswore fealty to Théoden and became his squire. Without permission from\nhis liege, he rode to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in the care of\nyoung Dernhelm (who was actually Éowyn, though Merry didn't know it).\nWhen Nazgûl attacked the Riders of Rohan and Théoden was injured, Merry\nand Éowyn faced the Witch King of Angmar alone. Here, Merry's companion\nrevealed herself to be Éowyn. Battling both fell beast and the Nazgûl\nalone, Éowyn was well assisted by Merry's crucial move: his sword, built\nfor this very purpose, was one of the few weapons able to pierce the\nRingwraith's form, but at a great expense to himself. He cut the Witch\nKing behind the knee as he was about to kill Eowyn. This was enough to\nallow Éowyn to finish off the Witch-king. Merry heard Théoden's last\nwords, but went unnoticed by the honour escort of Riders and was found\nwandering the city by Pippin. He was saved by the healing of Aragorn and\nrecovered fully.\n\nFor his bravery in battle, King Éomer, as the new King of Rohan,\nknighted him and gave him the name of “Holdwine”. During the Scouring of\nthe Shire, he was in the forefront of the Battle of Bywater, using the\nHorn of Rohan presented to him by Éowyn.\n\nLegacy\n\nUpon their return he and Pippin both got married to beautiful hobbit\nwomen. They were also the tallest of hobbits - Meriadoc being the\nslightly taller of the two - taller even than the legendary Bandobras\n“Bullroarer” Took, due to their having drunk large amounts of Entwater.\nMerry married Estella Bolger some time after the end of the Third Age.\nHe became the Master of Buckland in SR 1432 (FA 11).

After years of\nwandering westwards in search of the High Elves (or the Valar, of whom\nthe Bëorians had heard rumor from the lesser elves they had met in the\neast), Bëor was eager to establish good relations with Felagund, and the\ntwo strove to understand each other.

His lineage and influence\nleft him in a position to challenge the current king, Eldacar, who was\nonly half Dúnedain. As King Valacar's only son, Eldacar was the\nlegitimate heir to the throne, but his half Rhovanion lineage angered\ncitizens who believed in a pure dúnedain royalty. Capitalizing on what\nbecame outright protest against the current king, Castamir was able to\nincite rebellion and besiege Eldacar within the city Osgiliath in TA\n1437 of the Third Age. The city was set on fire by Castamir's troops,\ndestroying the famed Dome of Stars. Shortly thereafter, Eldacar fled the\ncity and into exile in Rhovanion, to the north. With the defeat of the\nking, Castamir seized the throne.\n\nFor ten years Castamir ruled Gondor with an iron fist, while Eldacar\nquietly regained power. Castamir ruled cruelly, and committed many foul\ndeeds, including executing Eldacar's own son, Ornendil. At first the\npeople of Gondor tolerated Castamir because of his pure Númenórean\nblood. Then, in 1447, Castamir, now called “the Usurper” by his people\nwas overthrown after a decade of wicked rule with the people now\nrallying around the true king, Eldacar. He was slain by Eldacar's forces\nat the Battle of Erui, the decisive battle of the Kin-strife as this\nperiod came to be known. At the Crossings of Erui, Eldacar personally\nslew Castamir.\n\nCastamir's influence did not end there. Remnants of his forces, and his\nsurviving sons, retreated from the Battle of Erui to the port of\nPelargir and escaped by ship to Umbar, far to the south. These\ndescendants of Castamir became the so-called “Corsairs of Umbar”, fierce\npirates who terrorized the ports of Gondor with the help of the men of\nHarad. They were perhaps the greatest threat to Gondor for nearly 400\nyears, commanding massive fleets of ships. Their most infamous exploit\nwas the Raid of Pelargir in TA 1634, in which a Corsair armada led by\nhis great-grandsons Angamaitë‎ and Sangahyando‎ sailed up the river\nAnduin to the port of Pelargir, deep in Gondor's territory. This raid\ncoincided with the young King Minardil's visit, and he was slain in by\nthe Corsairs as they attacked.\n\nThey remained a significant threat until TA 1810, when King Telumehtar\nretook Umbar for Gondor. So great a victory was this, that forever after\nTelumehtar was known as Umbardacil, which literally means “victor over\nUmbar”. In this battle the last descendants of Castamir were finally\nkilled."

Celeborn was said to be one of the wisest Elves\nin Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Celeborn defended Lothlórien and led the\nassault on the Enemy castle of Dol Guldur. He remained in Middle-earth\nfor a time at the beginning of the Fourth Age, but eventually he joined\nhis wife in the Undying Lands.\n\n\nBiography\n\nOrigins\n\nCeleborn was a Prince of Doriath and a kinsman of Thingol, the King of\nDoriath. Celeborn was said to be the grandson of Thingol's brother Elmo.\nCeleborn's father was Galadhon and he had a brother named Galathil.\n\nFirst Age\n\nAround FA 52, Galadriel came to Doriath. Galadriel was one of the Ñoldor\nwho came to Middle-earth wishing to see the lands and rule a realm of\nher own. She came with the second 'group' of elves from Aman with\nFingolfin and Finrod. Celeborn and Galadriel fell in love and married\neach other.\n\nIt is not clear how long Celeborn and Galadriel dwelled in Beleriand.\nAccording to one story, they left Beleriand and crossed the Blue\nMountains into Eriador before the Fall of Nargothrond in FA 495, but\naccording to another story they remained in Beleriand until the end of\nthe First Age.\n\nAround FA 502, King Thingol of Doriath summoned dwarf craftsmen to set a\nSilmaril in Nauglamir, the fabled jeweled Necklace of the Dwarves. The\ndwarf craftsmen coveted the necklace and especially the Silmaril, and\nthey demanded that Thingol give it to them. When Thingol refused, they\nkilled him and took the necklace set with the Silmaril. The Dwarven\ncraftsmen were pursued by Elves of Doriath, who killed the Dwarves and\nretrieved the necklace. However, two Dwarves escaped and returned to\nNogrod in the Blue Mountains and rallied their kinsmen to seek vengeance\non the Elves of Doriath. An army of Dwarves attacked Doriath and\ndefeated the elves. They took the necklace once more, but Beren again\nreclaimed it.\n\nDoriath was briefly re-inhabited by Beren's son Dior Eluchíl, but the\nsons of Feanor came to try to take the Silmaril. Though Dior's daughter\nElwing escaped with the Silmaril, Dior was killed and Doriath was ruined\nand abandoned.\n\nCeleborn's distrust of Dwarves began at this time. His role in these\nevents is unknown, although in one account it is written that Celeborn\nescaped the sack of Doriath.\n\nThe First Age ended with the War of Wrath and the defeat of Morgoth.\nBeleriand was ruined and sank beneath the Sea. Many of the Ñoldor\nreturned to the Undying Lands with the pardon of the Valar, but\nGaladriel remained in Middle-earth with Celeborn.\n\nSecond Age\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel probably lived for a time in Lindon, a coastal\nregion west of the Blue Mountains. Gil-galad was the High King of the\nelves who dwelled in Lindon. However, many of the elves in Harlindon -\nthe part of Lindon south of the Gulf of Lune - were Sindarin elves like\nCeleborn, and he may have ruled a fiefdom there under Gil-galad.\n\nAt some time early in the Second Age, Celeborn and Galadriel are said to\nhave moved eastward into Eriador with a number of Elves in their\nfollowing. They may have lived for a while near Lake Evendim. Their\ndaughter Celebrian may have been born during this time. They began to\nmove eastward again around the year SA 700 because Galadriel sensed a\ngrowing evil in Middle-earth that she felt duty-bound to oppose.\n\nThe realm of Eregion was founded in SA 750, and Galadriel and Celeborn\nare said to have dwelled there for a time along with Celebrimbor and the\nElven-smiths. The Elves of Eregion had dealings with the Dwarves of\nKhazad-dûm nearby, but Celeborn still distrusted Dwarves and would not\nenter Khazad-dûm, although the Dwarves there had nothing to do with the\ndestruction of Doriath.\n\nThe Elves of Eregion also had contact with the Elves of Lothlórien on\nthe other side of the Misty Mountains. According to one story, Galadriel\nwent to dwell in Lothlórien around SA 1350 to SA 1400 while Celeborn\nremained in Eregion. However, in other versions of the story both\nGaladriel and Celeborn stayed in Eregion.\n\nSauron came to Eregion in a fair disguise as Annatar the “Lord of gifts”\nin SA 1200 and deceived the Elven-smiths, who began forging the Rings of\nPower under his instruction in SA 1500. Sauron forged the One Ring to\nrule the others around SA 1600, and Celebrimbor hid from him the Three\nElven Rings of power that he had made without Sauron knowing of its\ncreation and help. Enraged, Sauron attacked Eregion in SA 1697.\n\nCeleborn led a sortie from Eregion to meet the vanguard of Sauron's\narmy. He was able to drive the enemy back long enough to join forces\nwith Elrond, who brought reinforcements from Lindon. But Sauron's army\nwas greater than their combined forces and Eregion soon fell.\nCelebrimbor was killed, and Sauron took the Nine Rings and at least six\nof the Seven rings. Sauron would eventually be driven back to Mordor in\nSA 1701.\n\nThe movements of Celeborn and Galadriel after the fall of Eregion are\nunclear. Celeborn may have gone to Lothlórien to help strengthen their\ndefenses against Sauron. He and Galadriel may have lived there for a\ntime, but they did not become the rulers of Lothlórien then. The king of\nLothlórien at that time was Amdír, who was killed in the War of the Last\nAlliance at the end of the Second Age and was succeeded by his son\nAmroth.\n\nThird Age\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel may also have lived for a while in Rivendell, the\nhome of Elrond. At some point, they may have travelled to the coastal\nregion of Belfalas in the south to be near the sea.\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel's daughter Celebrian married Elrond in TA 109.\nElrond and Celebrian had three children: twin sons Elladan and Elrohir,\nborn in TA 130, and a daughter Arwen, born in TA 241.\n\nAround TA 1050, the Necromancer, who was actually Sauron, built the\nstronghold of Dol Guldur across the Anduin from Lothlórien. Celeborn and\nGaladriel are said to have returned to Lothlórien to investigate the\nNecromancer and ensure the safety of Lothlórien. But after a time, they\nonce again departed, possibly for Rivendell. Lothlórien remained under\nthe rule of King Amroth.\n\nA Balrog awoke in Khazad-dum in TA 1980. Many of the Elves of Lothlórien\nfled, including Amroth's lover Nimrodel. Amroth followed Nimrodel and he\nlater perished at sea. Lothlórien was left without a leader, so Celeborn\nand Galadriel returned there and became the Lord and Lady of Lothlórien\nin TA 1981. They ruled the realm from Caras Galadhon, the City of the\nTrees.\n\nCelebrian was on her way to Lothlórien to visit her parents in TA 2509\nwhen she was captured by orcs in Caradhras. Her sons Elladan and Elrohir\nrescued Celebrian, but the horror of the experience remained with her\nand she decided to leave Middle-earth the next year to dwell in the\nUndying Lands.\n\nIn TA 2941, Sauron was driven out of Dol Guldur by the White Council -\nof which Galadriel was a member. However, Sauron had been prepared for\nthe attack and returned to Mordor. He sent Nazgûl led by Khamul to\noccupy Dol Guldur.\n\nAragorn came to Lothlórien in TA 2980 and became betrothed to Arwen, who\nwas there visiting her grandparents.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nIn December of 3018, Elladan and Elrohir brought word to Celeborn and\nGaladriel of the Fellowship of the Ring's quest to destroy the One Ring.\nThe Fellowship arrived in Lothlórien on January 15, 3019, and was\nbrought to Caras Galadhon to meet Celeborn and Galadriel on January 17.\n\n\n\nCeleborn at first welcomed Gimli despite his distrust of Dwarves and\nsaid he hoped that there could be friendship between their peoples once\nmore. Then he  learned that the Balrog had been disturbed by an\nexpedition of Dwarves to Khazad-dum led by Balin several years before,\nand that the Balrog had attacked the Fellowship resulting in the loss of\nGandalf the Grey. Celeborn was angry at first and regretted allowing the\nFellowship to enter Lothlórien, but Galadriel soothed him and he\napologized to Gimli.\n\nCeleborn promised to help the Fellowship in any way he could. On the eve\nof the Fellowship's departure from Lothlórien, he discussed what route\nthey might take, and offered them boats to ease their journey down the\nAnduin. The next day on February 16, Celeborn and Galadriel prepared a\nfeast for the Fellowship and gave them gifts. Celeborn gave them further\nadvice about navigating the Great River Anduin.\n\n\n\nLothlórien was attacked thrice by forces from Dol Guldur during the War\nof the Ring: on March 11, 15, and 22. Each time, the Galadhrim led by\nCeleborn and Galadriel repelled them. After the destruction of the One\nRing and Sauron's defeat, Celeborn led a force across the Anduin and\ncaptured Dol Guldur on March 28. The shadow was lifted from Mirkwood.\n\nOn April 6, Celeborn met Thranduil, the King of the Woodland Realm, in\nMirkwood. They renamed the forest the Wood of Greenleaves. Thranduil\nretained kingship of the northern part of the forest, while the center\npart was given to the Beornings and the Woodmen. Celeborn claimed the\nsouthern part of the forest below the Narrows of the Forest to be part\nof Lothlórien. This region was named East Lórien.\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel accompanied their granddaughter Arwen to Minas\nTirith, where she wed Aragorn on Midyear's Day. Celeborn and Galadriel\nthen travelled to Rohan and attended the funeral of the King Theoden. On\nthe way home, they met with Treebeard at Isengard.\n\nWhen Celeborn and Galadriel parted from Aragorn, Celeborn said to his\ngranddaughter's husband: _“Kinsman, farewell! May your doom be other\nthan mine, and your treasure remain with you to the end!”_\n\nCeleborn may have been anticipating the day when his own wife would\ndepart for the Undying Lands while he remained in Middle-earth. On\nSeptember 13, Celeborn and Galadriel crossed the Redhorn Gate to return\nto Lothlórien.\n\nFourth Age\n\n\n\nGaladriel left Middle-earth to return to the Undying Lands in 3021 at\nthe end of the Third Age. Celeborn remained in Lothlórien, but after a\nfew years he began to grow weary. He went to Rivendell to live with his\ngrandsons Elladan and Elrohir for awhile in the early part of the Fourth\nAge. Eventually, Celeborn went to the Grey Havens and sailed for the\nUndying Lands where his wife and daughter dwelled. It is said that “with\nhim went the last living memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth.”\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _CELEBORN_ means “Silver tree”, from the Sindarin words _celeb_\n(“silver”) and _orn_ (“tree”). His original name was TELEPORNO, a\nTelerin name which means “Silver-high”, from Quenyan _tyelpe_\n(“silver”).\n\n\nPronunciation\n\nCeleborn is pronounced ‘Keleborn’ and not ‘Seleborn’\n\n\nAppearances in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n-   _The Silmarillion_\n-   _Unfinished Tales_\n\nIn the movies\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film trilogy\n\nCeleborn was portrayed by Marton Csokas in _The Lord of the Rings: The\nFellowship of the Ring_, directed by Peter Jackson, but his scenes in\n_The Two Towers_ were cut for running time purposes. He briefly appears\nat the end of _The Return of the King_ before the Elven boat departs\nfrom the Grey Havens.\n\nRalph Bakshi\n\n\n\nIn Ralph Bakshi's version of _The Lord of the Rings_, Celeborn was\nbriefly seen with Galadriel greeting the Fellowship of the Ring on\narrival. He was voiced by an unknown actor.\n\nVideo games\n\n-   Celeborn appears in _The Lord of the Rings Online_.\n\n\nTrivia\n\n-   Celeborn is one of the other possible members of The White Council,\n    along with the mightiest of Elves like Glorfindel and Erestor,\n    Elrond's chief counsellor."

    "text": "CELEBRIMBOR was a Ñoldorin prince, and the last in the line of the House\nof Fëanor, who lived in Middle-earth. He was a ruler of Eregion in the\nSecond Age, and a master smith. He is remembered primarily for his\ncreation of the three greatest Elven Rings of Power: Vilya, Narya, and\nNenya.\n\n\nBiography\n\nFirst Age\n\n\n\nCelebrimbor was the son of Curufin, who was the fifth son of Fëanor (son\nof Finwë and his first wife Miriel) and Nerdanel. During the First\nAge, he lived with his father in Nargothrond, but took no part in the\ndeeds of Curufin and Celegorm regarding Lúthien, Beren, and Finrod. He\nin fact repudiated his father's deeds, and did not follow his father and\nuncle when they were expelled from Nargothrond.\n\nSecond Age\n\n\n\nCelebrimbor settled in Eregion in the Second Age and started dealing\nwith the Dwarves of the realm of Khazad-dûm. In SA 1500, Sauron, calling\nhimself _Annatar_ (“Lord of Gifts”), befriended the Ñoldor of Eregion.\nHe claimed to be an emissary of the Valar, especially Aulë, and\ninstructed them in the art of ring-making. Celebrimbor distrusted\nhim, but the smiths of Eregion were deceived. Under the guidance and\ninstruction of Sauron, the smiths openly made rings to learn the craft,\nbut unknown to them the craft taught by Sauron incorporated a binding\nmagic into the rings.\n\nIn secret, Sauron forged the One Ring, a master ring that would rule all\nthe lesser rings, to enable him to rule Middle-earth via its influence\nover those who used the other rings. When Sauron placed the One Ring on\nhis finger, claiming dominance over all the Rings of Power and their\nbearers, the elves knew his true identity and intentions. Celebrimbor\nand the elves of Eregion defied Sauron by withholding the other rings\nfrom him. The greatest of the rings (aside from the One Ring) were\ncreated by Celebrimbor himself, and these were never touched by Sauron\nand thus were uncorrupted by him, although they were still subject to\nthe One Ring. These were the three Rings of the Elves, the fairest of\nthe Rings of Power. Celebrimbor named them Vilya, Narya, and Nenya after\nthe principal Middle-earth elements of air, fire and water,\nrespectively. He sent the three rings away for safekeeping: Vilya and\nNarya to Gil-galad in Lindon; and Nenya to Galadriel in Lórien.\n\n\n\nSauron retaliated by attacking Eregion, laying waste to the realm.\nCelebrimbor was captured in the chaos and was forced, under torture, to\ndisclose where the lesser rings were, but he would not reveal the\nwhereabouts of the three greatest of them that he had sent away for\nsafekeeping. Celebrimbor died from his torment; his body was shot with\narrows and hung upon a pole, and was later paraded as a banner as Sauron\nattacked the elves. He was the last direct descendant of the line of\nFëanor, save perhaps for his father's brother Maglor, whose fate is\nunknown and is said by some legends to still wander the shores of the\nSea. It is unknown if he married or not or if he had children or not.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis father-name was TELPERINQUAR, which means “Silver-fist” or “Hand of\nsilver” in Quenya. It comes from the words _telpë_ (“silver”) and _quár_\n(“fist”). His mother-name remains unknown. The name CELEBRIMBOR is the\nSindarin translation of his father-name, which comes from _celeb_\n(“silver”) and _baur_ (“fist”).\n\n\nCharacter\n\nUnlike both his father and his grandfather, Celebrimbor was portrayed as\nbeing both selfless and kind, and was neither prideful nor covetous of\nthat which he created. He was described to have an “almost Dwarvish\nobsession with crafts”; he became a famous artificer and smith in\nboth Gondolin and Eregion. His love for crafts took him to Eregion,\nwhere he was introduced to a precious metal and called it Mithril.\nMithril was mined by Dwarves in their nearby Mine Realm of Khazad-dum,\nalso named Moria. Great friendship with the Dwarves of Moria developed,\nskills and secrets were shared between the two peoples for many years\nvia The High Road which was built between the two realms. But a long\nperiod of peace would not last, for upon realizing the trap which Sauron\nhad devised for him, Celebrimbor was filled with anxiety and fear for\nhis people, and was later described as the heroic defender of\nEregion.\n\n\nImportant Works\n\n\n\n-   Rings of Power\n    -   The Nine Rings of Men (with Annatar)\n    -   The Seven Rings of the Dwarves (with Annatar)\n    -   The Three Rings of the Elves\n-   Doors of Durin (with Narvi) \n\n\nOther forms of the legendarium\n\nIn some accounts, Celebrimbor was a Sindar elf, an ancestor of Daeron,\nwho used Feanorian scripts.\n\nLater, Celebrimbor was changed and became of Ñoldorin origin, and a\nsurvivor of the Fall of Gondolin. In the _Unfinished Tales_, a\nstatement claims Celebrimbor to be one of the Teleri who accompanied\nCeleborn to exile.\n\nAnother version of the story has Celebrimbor revolt against Galadriel,\nafter Galadriel and Celeborn established Eregion . Celebrimbor and\nGaladriel were later reconciled once Sauron's trickery was revealed.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptions\n\nVideo games\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrimbor appears in the video games _Middle-earth: Shadow of\nMordor_and _Middle-earth: Shadow of War_, as the wraith assisting the\nranger Talion in destroying the forces of Sauron. Developers have\nrevealed that he assists Talion due to the guilt he feels for creating\nthe Rings of Power, and thus he feels ultimately responsible for the\ntrouble Middle-earth is in. However, the Celebrimbor that appears in the\ngame differs from the Tolkien Celebrimbor in that he not only makes the\nthree Elf rings, but he crafts all of the Rings of Power, and when\ncaptured helps Sauron reforge the One Ring (via the inscription of the\nlettering of the Ring upon it) and assists him in creating the Nazgul by\naccompanying Sauron to the men who eventually would become the Nine; he\nalso gave the Ring a will of its own. However, once Sauron's intentions\nwere revealed to him, he stole the One Ring and used it to command an\narmy of orcs and Uruks to fight Sauron and lay claim over Mordor. In a\nfinal battle, Celebrimbor used the Ring's power of invisibility to\ndefeat Sauron. However the ring wanted to return to the Dark Lord, and\nso it slipped off of Celebrimbor's finger and onto Sauron's, breaking\nCelebrimbor's control over his orc army. Captured by Sauron, the elf was\nthen tortured as punishment, such as witnessing his family tortured and\nkilled in front of him, before finally being beaten to death with his\nown Mithril hammer by Sauron.\n\n\n\nWhen the game takes place and the protagonist, Talion, is slain in a\nblood-ritual, Celebrimbor is bound to the ranger, which allows Talion to\nreturn from the dead (in addition to many other abilities). He has no\nmemory of his past, not even remembering his own name until they find an\nartifact that belonged to him (with the assistance of Gollum,) and with\neach artifact they find more of his memory is restored. Gollum\neventually abandons them, leaving them to find the last artifact in Udûn\non their own. They also assist a low ranking captain named Ratbag\nadvance through the ranks until he advances to Warchief, and kill all\nother warchiefs (leaving Ratbag in charge of all the uruks in Udûn),\nwhich leads to his demise after he is blamed for failing to prevent the\ndestruction of a monument to Sauron by the Hammer of Sauron, a Black\nCaptain and a lieutenant of the Black Hand of Sauron (the leader of the\nuruks in Sauron's stead). Talion (and Celebrimbor) is approached by\nLithariel, the daughter of the Queen of the Tribesmen of Núrnen, who\nclaims her mother has summoned Talion to her chambers.\n\nTheir job finished in Udûn, they make their way to Núrnen and have an\naudience with Queen Marwen (who looks similar to King Théoden when he\nwas enchanted by Saruman), who gives them another artifact from\nCelebrimbor's past.\n\nThis artifact gives the wraith and his host their key to confronting the\nBlack Hand: branding. They begin building their army by branding the\ncaptains and warchiefs of Núrnen (and optionally Udûn), thus enabling\nthem to confront the Black Hand at his fortress of Ered Glamhoth, the\nstrength of his forces depending on how many warchiefs and captains he\nbranded. They return to the queen to tell her they are prepared to leave\nwhen suddenly the Queen begins forcing Celebrimbor out of Talion, saying\nthat they can defeat Sauron “together.” As Talion dies, he tells\nLithariel, Marwen's daughter, to break the Queen's staff, and when it\nbreaks, the Queen becomes youthful again, and reveals she went to the\nIstari Saruman for assistance in helping her people survive Sauron's\nonslaught. Celebrimbor suspects that Saruman may have gone rogue, and\nmay be desiring the One for himself. Marwen nonetheless assists Talion\nby acquiring them a smuggler, which they use to go to the Black Hand's\nfortress.\n\nWhen Talion enters the fortress, a skeleton bound to a pole by rope\nbegins talking directly to Talion, and Celebrimbor reveals that the\nTower of Sauron, another Black Captain and the Black Hand's right hand,\nis responsible for this, and thus is here in the Black Hand's stead.\nTalion approaches the Black Hand's throne, and as he looks for the\nTower, the Black Captain appears in the throne, and reveals the Black\nHand went looking for Talion. He addresses Celebrimbor directly, telling\nhim Sauron forgives him and, if he casts off that “corpse” and becomes\none with him, he will have his dreams fulfilled. Celebrimbor rebukes the\nTower, saying that Talion and the wraith will never surrender.\n\nFailing to deceive Celebrimbor, he reveals to Talion that the Ringmaker\ndeceived Talion by pretending that the Black Hand of Sauron placed a\ncurse on them, binding them together, where in reality Cerebrimbor chose\nTalion as his “host” and could have released him at any time. Talion\ninsists that the Tower stand up and fight, to which the Tower obliges.\nHe creates illusions of himself, forcing Talion to drain the illusions\nto sap the Tower of his power.\n\nAfter the illusions are eliminated, Talion hears his wife Ioreth\nsinging, and when he gets close to her, his wife is revealed as the\nTower, who attempts to brand Talion. However, the ranger overpowers him\nand brutally kills him, stabbing him with his son's dagger, Acharn, four\ntimes in the heart, before shoving his sword, Urafel, into the Tower's\nlaughing mouth. After the Tower's death, Talion reveals his anger at\nCelebrimbor for his deceit, saying he wanted to be with his wife and son\ninstead of being alone alive. Celebrimbor points out though that the\nranger wanted revenge, and thus he gave him the means to do so. The\nRingmaker does admit that he can leave Talion, if he wants. Yet before\nthey can part ways, the wraith says that they must finish what they\nstarted by killing their true target: the Black Hand. Talion reluctantly\nagrees, and the pair set sail for Núrnen once more.\n\nHowever, they find the Queen's palace sacked, and blood on the throne.\nThe queen's crown, however, was left, and when Talion picks it up,\nanother set of Celebrimbor's memories are returned to him. They figure\nthe Black Hand has them in Udûn, preparing an exchange for Celebrimbor\nfor the Queen and her daughter. They arrive in the now-dark, ashed\nfilled Udûn, where they find the Black Hand's elite guards standing\nwatch for the duo. When the Talion arrives at the Black Gate riding a\nCaragor, his branded Uruks and warchiefs are already fighting the rank\nand file Uruks. Then finally, with a warchief and a set of captains, the\nTalons of the Black Hand reveal themselves, along with a host of rank\nand file uruks. To Talion's sadness, The Talons reveal that they\nslaughtered all of the Núrnen tribesman, including Lithariel and Queen\nMarwen. After a brutal fight, the Talons are defeated, and the remaining\nbranded Uruks that assisted Talion remain behind to fight the Black\nHand's forces. Meanwhile, the Gravewalker climbs the Black Gate, and\nfind the Black Hand waiting for him. Then quite subtly, the Black\nCaptain lures the wraith duo in and unleashes a blast of energy that\ngives Celebrimbor more of his memories: his confrontation with Sauron in\nthe fields of Udûn ending in failure, the return of Sauron's ring, and\nthe brutal murders of Celebrimbor's family before his eyes, before being\nmurdered himself. This gives Celebrimbor more power as a result. The\nBlack Hand tells Celebrimbor that when he originally performed the blood\nritual in an attempt to absorb his spirit into the Black Hand's\ncorporeal form (thus reforming an avatar of Sauron, though he would not\nbe at full strength), he gave him a choice: to stand by Sauron's side.\nHe then tells the gravewalker duo that Talion and Celebrimbor have no\nchoice in the matter, and surprisingly performs the blood ritual on\nhimself, absorbing Celebrimbor into the Black Hand and forming the\navatar of Sauron. Sauron tries to kill the already dying Talion, but as\nSauron is about to deliver the finishing blow, Celebrimbor uses his\nenergy to temporarily stun Sauron. This gives Talion the chance he\nneeded to kill the avatar of Sauron, and thus the Black Hand, with his\nsword.\n\nTalion relieved that he has finally exacted vengeance for his family,\nsees Celebrimbor waiting, ready to go to the afterlife together. Talion,\nhowever, insists that together they should use their powers to combat\nSauron, because they both know as long as his Ring exists, he will\nreturn again, no matter in what form. Celebrimbor insists that fighting\nSauron is mortally impossible, because he tried once long ago and it\ncouldn't be done. Talion asks the Ringmaker if he could die knowing\nthere was chance that they could defeat Sauron, but they didn't take it.\nCelebrimbor simply disappears, and doesn't answer. Talion, looking at\nUdûn's red sun, declares to himself and the wraith that it's time for\nthem to forge new ring, as his eyes glow with the wraith's power.\n\nThe two then travel to Mount Doom, and proceed to forge a new ring. Upon\nit's completion, Celebrimbor is separated from Talion by Shelob, and\nTalion takes the new ring to survive without the wraith. He later finds\nhim in Shelob's lair within Cirith Ungol, and gives her the new ring in\nexchange for Celebrimbor. The elven wraith dislikes this exchange\nhowever, but Shelob's natural powers amplified by the ring prove to be\ntoo strong to fight, and thus the duo shifts their attention to a new\ntarget; The Palantíri in Minas Ithil.\n\nAfter the city's eventual fall, Sauron sends 8 ringwraiths to force the\nnew ring from Shelob. Realizing the danger that keeping the ring would\ncause to both her and to Middle-earth, she returns the ring to it's\nforgers. The ranger and the wraith then proceed to Nurnen, where they\nuse the ring's power to build an army and take over the region;\nSubsequently, they are betrayed by an ally in the process, only to exact\nrevenge on him with utter cruelty. Of course, Celebrimbor's cruelty\nhints to Talion that the ring's power is starting to affect the elf's\nsanity.\n\n\n\nEventually, after conquering most of Sauron's domain, defeating a Balrog\nwith the help of Carnan, a nature spirit, and finding out the identities\nof some of the Nazgul, the duo takes their army and march towards\nBarad-dûr, only to be stopped by one of the ringwraiths, Isildur. Upon\nhis defeat, Talion decides to end the fallen hero's torment, and\npermanently kills him. However, Celebrimbor considers this an act of\nbetrayal; he reveals that his plan has gone from simple revenge to\ntyranny, as he plans on brainwashing Sauron and ruling Middle-earth\nthrough him. As Talion objects to this plan, the wraith abandons the\nranger's body and takes over Eltariel's, leaving Talion to bleed to\ndeath.\n\nAs Talion picks up Isildur's ring, he becomes a ringwraith and decided\nto take back Minas Morgul, whilst Celebrimbor and his new host face\nSauron. Eventually, Sauron, in his Annatar form, finds himself on his\nknees, and Celebrimbor begins to brand him. Sauron pulls out a blade and\nslices off Eltariel's fingers, just like Isildur had done to him\ncenturies earlier. With Sauron now having the upper hand, he consumes\nthe wraith, but with adverse effects; they both become the flaming eye\nof Sauron, locked into a battle off wills. The two fought until the One\nRing was destroyed in the War of the Ring, wherein the Dark Lord Sauron\nwas finally defeated.\n\nHowever, Celebrimbor did not fade from middle-earth as Sauron did, for,\nlike Sauron, he had poured his own life force into his own ring. Thus,\nCelebrimbor was freed and the New Ring, now worn by the Elven assassin\nEltariel, started expressing a desire to return to it's creator...\n\nCelebrimbor is voiced by Alastair Duncan."

    "text": "CELEBRÍAN (IPA: ) was an Elven noblewoman, the daughter of Celeborn and\nGaladriel, wife of Elrond, and mother of Elrohir, Elladan and Arwen.\n\n\nBiography\n\nCelebrían's birth date is unspecified, though she might have been born\nnear Lake Evendim between SA 350 and SA 400. She lived with her mother\nGaladriel in Eregion, and later fled to Lórinand sometime between SA\n1350 and SA 1400. After a time, Galadriel and Celebrían passed through\nMoria and dwelt in Rivendell. There, she met Elrond who loved her,\nthough he said nothing about it.\n\nIn TA 109, Elrond wedded Celebrían. She bore him twin sons, Elladan and\nElrohir in TA 130, and then a daughter, Arwen in TA 241.\n\nIn TA 2509, Celebrían was on her way to visit her parents in Lothlórien\nwhen she was waylaid by Orcs in the Redhorn Pass of the Misty Mountains.\nShe was then tormented by the orcs and received a poisoned wound. Her\nsons arrived much later to rescue her, and Elrond to heal her, but\nCelebrían was never fully-healed in mind and spirit. Horrified and\nhaunted by the fearful memories of her torture, she no longer desired to\nremain on Middle-earth, and sailed west the next year in the TA 2510.\n\n\nLater mentions\n\nThere are several references of Celebrían in _The Lord of the Rings_,\nsuch as the mention of her torment and being the daughter of\nGaladriel.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name CELEBRÍAN means “Silver queen”, from the Sindarin words\n_celeb_ (“silver”) and _rían_ (“queen”).\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn earlier writings, Amroth the King of Lothlórien was the son of\nCeleborn and Galadriel, and the brother of Celebrían. It was said that\nGaladriel fled with Amroth and Celebrían to Lothlórien. When Galadriel\nand Celebrían left for Rivendell, Amroth was left in the forest, and\nwould later visit his family when they lived in Dol Amroth.\n\nIn other versions, Celebrían wedded Elrond in TA 2500, but in TA 2600,\nshe was slain (not captured) by the Orcs in the Misty Mountains. Her\nchildren were Elladan and Elrohir, and Finduilas (later Arwen).\n\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nTolkien has said that “after the destruction of the Ruling Ring the\nThree Rings of the Eldar lost their virtue. Then Elrond prepared at last\nto depart from Middle-earth and follow Celebrían.” Thus it passed\nthat after 500 long years, at the Haven of Avallonë in Tol Eressëa,\nElrond and Celebrían were finally reunited, sometime after TA 3021 (the\nRing-bearer sailing on September 29, 3021). However, Elrond was then\n“sundered” forever from his beloved daughter.\n\nBjörn Fromén has composed an evocative poem, Celebrían's Farewell to\nElrond, _Valinórenna_."

As with all\nthe Elves of Aman, they lived in peace and prosperity until the release\nof Melkor, the murder of Finwë and the theft of the Silmarils that led\nto the Flight of the Noldor.\n\nAs with the other Sons of Fëanor, Curufin was bound by an oath to\nrecover his father's Silmarils, which had been stolen by the Dark Lord\nMorgoth. His oath took him and his brothers to Middle-earth during the\nFirst Age.\n\nArriving in Middle-earth, Fëanor roused Curufin and others who were most\nobedient to him, and set the swan-ships aflame. Later, Curufin and his\nbrothers fought in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath but lost their father\nFëanor.\n\nCurufin and his older brother Celegorm (and possibly Celebrimbor) lived\nin Himlad, east of his brother Maedhros' fortress Himring and south of\nAglon, a Pass between Himring and Dorthonion, leading into Doriath.\nAround this time, their cousin Aredhel left Gondolin in search for both\nsons of Fëanor. However, Curufin and Celegorm were not in their lands\nwhen she arrived, thus Aredhel left and traveled south and was lost in\nNan Elmoth. Years later, Aredhel and her son Maeglin left Nan Elmoth,\nand Eöl traveled after them, only to be brought to Curufin. Though they\nhad no love for him and scorned him, they did not slay him and allowed\nhim to continue on his way.\n\nThe two brothers fortified their realms with great strength and held\nthem until the Dagor Bragollach, by which time it was forced. However,\nfollowing the Dagor Bragollach, the two brothers were defeated and had\nto flee with their people to Nargothrond, where Finrod welcomed them.\n\n\n\nShortly after, Beren also came to Nargothrond to remind Finrod of the\noath he had sworn, and claim his help. Finrod decided to help Beren, but\nCelegorm and Curufin, remembering their Oath, persuaded the people of\nNargothrond not to follow him, and not to wage open war against Morgoth,\nmaking them fearful. Finrod therefore had to leave with a handful of\nwarriors, including Beren, and later died. His nephew Orodreth was made\nto rule in his stead.\n\nHe and his brother went hunting with Celegorm's hound Huan, then found\nLúthien, daughter of Thingol, as she fled to find Beren. Feigning to\nhelp her, they took her captive and brought her to Nargothrond, for\nCelegorm had become enamoured and would have Thingol give him her hand.\nHowever, Huan helped Lúthien to flee, and they freed Beren and other\nthralls from Sauron. As these thralls returned, the people of\nNargothrond perceived the two brothers' treachery, and though Orodreth\nwould not let them be slain, he cast them from Nargothrond.\n\nThe two brothers met Lúthien and Beren as they fled, and Curufin fought\nwith Beren losing the knife Angrist in the struggle. Defeated, he had to\nflee with Celegorm, but sought to slay Lúthien even as he did, and shot\nBeren instead.\n\nDue to Celegorm and Curufin's deeds, Thingol and Orodreth would lend no\naid to Maedhros as he sought to unite Elves, Dwarves, and Men in what\nwas called the Union of Maedhros.\n\nCurufin fell in the Second Kinslaying, when the Sons of Fëanor attacked\nDoriath to seize a Silmaril in the possession of the Elvish King Dior\nthe Beautiful. His brothers Celegorm and Caranthir died with him during\nthe assault.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis father-name is CURUFINWË means “Skilled (son of) Finwë” from the\nQuenyan _curu_ (“Skill”). The name Curufinwë is also Fëanor's\noriginal name. This was because Curufin was most like his father both in\nappearance, temperament and skill. His mother-name is ATARINKË (“Little\nFather”) for he resembled his father in both mind and talent. He was\ncalled KURVO by his family members.\n\nOther Names\n\nTolkien provided Old English names for his characters.

Círdan and Celeborn were in Arda from sometime late in the\nYears of the Trees, through the First Age, until the Fourth Age. Tolkien\nhas written that Círdan would sail on the last ship into the West, as he\nis the Lord of the Grey Havens. So, it can thus be known that Círdan had\nthe longest incarnated single life span of any elf, having entered Arda\nduring the Years of the Trees and having left for Valinor later in the\nFourth Age than any other Elf.\n\n\nBiography\n\nFirst Age\n\nAfter the Teleri Elves Arrive to Aman\n\nIn the First Age, Círdan was a ruler of a host of the Teleri under Elwë,\nand during the long wait in Beleriand he fell in love with the sea. When\nUlmo returned for the Teleri, Círdan and his followers remained behind,\npartially because of their love for Belegaer, and partially because of\nhis kinship with Elwë, who was lost. After Elwë returned and became King\nThingol, Círdan ruled the Falathrim of the havens of Eglarest and\nBrithombar, although he seemed to have accepted Thingol's overlordship.\nLater he became an advisor and friend of Finrod Felagund, Lord of\nNargothrond, although the Falas remained independent.\n\n\n\nWars of Beleriand\n\nCírdan was early on warned by Ulmo not to attempt a crossing to Valinor,\nand his mariners restricted their work to the coasts of Middle-earth.\nHowever, at the request of King Turgon of Gondolin, he later built\nseveral messenger ships to sail to Valinor to request help from the\nValar against Morgoth. All these missions failed, and only one survivor\never returned. After the havens of the Falas were destroyed by FA 474,\nCírdan was instrumental in setting up the refuges at the Mouths of\nSirion and the Isle of Balar, to which he retired for the remainder of\nthe age. It was on this isle that he built the great ship Vingilot for\nEärendil.\n\nSecond Age\n\nIn the Second Age, Círdan stayed behind when the Elves were summoned to\nValinor, and set up the havens of Forlond, Harlond and Mithlond in the\ndestroyed land of Lindon (anciently Ossiriand). Círdan's exact status\nduring that time is unknown, but it seems certain he served as\nlieutenant of Gil-galad, the last High King of the Ñoldor of\nMiddle-earth. Círdan is mentioned as receiving the ships of the\nNúmenóreans as they returned to the north of Middle-earth, and also as\nbeing one of the only two elves (along with Elrond) who stood beside\nGil-galad during his last battle with Sauron.\n\nThird Age\n\n\n\nFrom the Third Age onwards, after the fall of Gil-galad and the\nbeginning of the Age of Men, Círdan remained at the Grey Havens of\nMithlond where he was lord, and built ships which ferried the departing\nElves to Valinor. Círdan had possession of the one of the Three Elven\nRings, Narya, but when the Wizards or Istari arrived in the early Third\nAge he recognised Olórin's wisdom, and gave him his ring.\n\nCírdan remained active behind the scenes, sending counsellors to the\nWhite Council at Rivendell, but following the War of the Ring he was\nseen to have prepared the ship that ferried across the other\nRing-bearers: Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Bilbo, and Frodo in the last\nyear of the Third Age. It is uncertain whether he left Middle-earth\nhimself on the same ship: he is not mentioned as boarding, and later\nletters by Tolkien imply he remained behind. There are contradictory\nreferences to the Fate of the Elves of Middle-earth scattered throughout\nTolkien's works, and it may be that Círdan's role as a facilitator for\nelves returning to the Blessed Realm continued for some time. There\nis one line that says that Círdan would remain until the last ship set\nsail for the west.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nCírdan had a beard, which was rare for Elves, and silver hair like\nThingol his overlord and kinsman. He was of great age at the time of the\nWar of the Ring: perhaps the oldest of the Telerin Elves or even of all\nthe elves remaining in Middle-earth. He may have been one of the elves\nwho awoke near Cuiviénen and therefore without a mother or father.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Círdan_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Ship-maker', and the Quenya\nform was said to be _CIRYATAN_. His original name was probably _NOWË_,\nwhich may be related to the term _nowo_ meaning “think, form idea,\nimagine.”\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptions\n\nLord of the Rings film trilogy\n\n\n\nIn Peter Jackson's _The Lord of the Rings_ movie trilogy, Círdan briefly\nappears in the first and third movies, played by Michael Elsworth. His\nrole as lieutenant of Gil-galad is given to Elrond instead (Elrond was\nGil-galad's herald in the books) in the first movie. He does, however,\nappear very briefly in Galadriel's Monologue at the start of the first\nmovie, in the brief shot of the three Elven ringbearers - and at the end\nof the third movie when Frodo, Galadriel, Elrond, Gandalf and Bilbo\nboard the ship at the Grey Havens and Círdan (beardless in this\nadaptation) is seen standing in the background."

    "text": "DENETHOR II was the twenty-sixth Ruling Steward of Gondor, and father of\nthe War of the Ring heroes Boromir and Faramir.\n\n\nBiography\n\nDenethor was the first child and eldest son of Ecthelion II. In TA\n2976, he married Finduilas of Dol Amroth, daughter of Prince Adrahil II\nof Dol Amroth. Together, the couple had two sons, Boromir and\nFaramir. A few years later, in TA 2988, Finduilas died, leaving Denethor\nbitter.\n\nHe succeeded his father Ecthelion II as the twenty-sixth Ruling Steward\nin TA 2984. During his stewardship, Gandalf was less welcome in Minas\nTirith and his counsels went unheeded.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nDenethor secretly used a Palantír to probe Sauron's strength, and he\nused it at the top of the White Tower in his secret chamber, above the\nThrone room. The effort aged him quickly, and the knowledge of\nSauron's overwhelming force exacerbated the bitterness that had taken\nroot at the time of the death of his wife, Finduilas, in TA 2988. Sauron\nused the Palantír to drive him mad with despair. He retained, however,\nan air of nobility and power. The death of Boromir, his eldest son and\nfavorite, and the siege and apparent doom of the capital city drove\nDenethor further along the path to madness. Following this, he became\nestranged from Faramir. Shockingly, Faramir still upheld his father's\nwishes.\n\nHis actions, however, did not immediately proclaim his insanity. The\nOsgiliath mission was not obviously suicidal, as the city had not yet\nbeen overrun. The Warning beacons of Gondor had indeed been lit,\nalthough Denethor expected little help, because of the fatalistic\nmindset that he had at that time of sorrow.\n\nHe committed suicide on March 15, 3019, having ordered his men to erect\na pyre for him and Faramir in the Hallows of Minas Tirith. He threw a\ntorch onto the pyre, then broke the white rod of his office over his\nknee and cast it into the flames, symbolizing the end of his stewardship\nand the end of the rule of the Stewards. He laid himself down on the\ntable and so perished, clasping the Palantíri in his hands. His attempt\nto take the grievously injured and apparently dying Faramir with him was\nthwarted by the timely intervention of Beregond and ultimately, by\nGandalf.\n\nDenethor II ruled as the Steward of Gondor for 35 years, from TA 2984\nuntil his death on TA 3019. The title of the Ruling Steward was passed\nto his son, Faramir, who also became the first of the Princes of\nIthilien.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nDENETHOR might have been named after the tenth Ruling Steward of Gondor,\nwho, in turn, was named after a Nandorin Elf. The name comes from the\nNandorin words _dene_ (“strong, lithe”) and _thara_ (“tall, slender”),\nand gives the name a meaning of “Lithe and lank”.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nTelevision/Radio\n\nDenethor was voiced by William Conrad in Rankin/Bass's 1980 animated\nadaptation of _The Return of the King_, and by Peter Vaughan in BBC\nRadio's 1981 serialisation.\n\n_The Lord of the Rings_ film trilogy\n\nIn Peter Jackson's movie trilogy, Denethor is portrayed by John Noble.\nIn a significant change from the novels, he is depicted as an\nincompetent leader driven to insanity by despair. He appears in the\nextended edition of _The Two Towers_ and is a secondary antagonist in\n_The Return of the King_.\n\nDenethor appears in one extended flashback scene in _The Two Towers_,\narriving at Osgiliath as it is liberated by Boromir's troops. He\ncongratulates his elder son while disparaging the younger Faramir, and\ncommands Boromir to travel to the Council of Elrond, take the One Ring,\nand return it to Gondor.\n\nIn _The Return of the King_, Denethor is depicted as overcome with\ndespair, convinced that Sauron cannot be opposed. He denies Aragorn's\nbirthright to the throne of Gondor, refuses to light the beacons to call\nRohan for aid and, after Osgiliath is captured by Mordor's forces, sends\nFaramir and his men on a suicide mission to retake the ruined city. When\nFaramir is brought back to Minas Tirith unconscious, Denethor hastily\nconcludes that his last son is dead and commands his guards to build a\nfuneral pyre for the both of them. As Sauron's armies attack Minas\nTirith, Denethor prepares to immolate himself alongside Faramir; only\nPippin and Gandalf's intervention saves Faramir's life. Denethor then\nthrows himself off of the pinnacle of Minas Tirith, engulfed in flames.\n\nThe _palantír_ of Minas Tirith, which causes Denethor's corruption in\nthe novels, is only hinted at in the extended edition of _The Return of\nthe King_."

Later still, when the Dwarves filled Bag End with\nmusic, Dwalin played on a viol as big as himself. Dwalin lent a green\nhood and cloak to Bilbo when they set out on their journey.\n\nAfter reclaiming the mountain from Smaug, Dwalin fought in the Battle of\nFive Armies and was one of those that survived the terrible battle.

After the War of the Ring was over, resulting the defeat of\nSauron and the destruction of the One Ring, Dwalin lived throughout his\nlife in the Fourth Age in Middle-earth and passed away in FO 91 at the\nage of 340, considered later than any other known date of death for\nothers of the company.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nRankin/Bass films\n\nIn the 1977 animated version of _The Hobbit_, he was voiced by Jack\nDeLeon.\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\nIn Peter Jackson's live-action adaptation, he was portrayed by Scottish\nactor Graham McTavish. The studio released the following statement\nregarding Dwalin in the trilogy:\n\n\n\n_Renowned as a great Warrior, Dwalin speaks his mind plainly and is not\none to suffer fools lightly. Fiercely loyal, he was Thorin Oakenshield's\nstaunchest supporter with an unshakeable belief in his friend's\nleadership. A powerful and bruising fighter, Dwalin has a natural\ntendency to distrust anyone who is not a Dwarf and is particularly\nsuspicious of Elves. Proud, brave and one of the tallest of the Dwarves,\nDwalin will bow to none but those who have earned his respect._\n\nA younger Dwalin (with a mohawk) is shown fighting alongside Thorin at\nthe Battle of Azanulbizar, duelling with Bolg, son of Azog.\n\nDuring the events of _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_, Dwalin has\nhis weapons stripped from him after being captured by the wood elves of\nMirkwood. Following the company's escape and their encounter with Bard\nthe Bowman, Dwalin openly voices his mistrust of Bard; suggesting that\nthey throw him overboard and take his boat by force. He later equips\nhimself with a large two-handed mace from Lake Town's armory for the\nraid on the Lonely Mountain. (_The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_\n(2013))\n\nIn ''The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, ''Dwalin along with the\nother dwarves follow Thorin as they barricade themselves inside Erebor.\nAfter Dain's army arrives and begins to fight Azog's huge orc army,\nThorin refuses to aid his cousin. Dwalin tries to persuade Thorin to aid\nthem, saying that Thorin is less of a man than he has even been. Dwalin\nthen follows Thorin, Fili and Kili to Ravenhill to fight Azog. He\nwitnesses Fili's death, and later comes to Bilbo's aid and fights off\nthe orcs. Dwalin then bows to Thorin's body after the battle. He is last\nseen with the rest of the company saying goodbye to Bilbo. (The Hobbit:\nThe Battle of the Five Armies(2014))."

    "text": "DÁIN II IRONFOOT (or simply KING DÁIN) was the son of Náin and the\ngrandson of Grór, the youngest son of Dáin I of Durin's folk, and was\nlord of the Dwarves of the Iron Hills in Wilderland. He was a Dwarven\nKing of Durin's Folk, the fifth King under the Mountain, and the Lord of\nthe Iron Hills during the War of the Ring in Middle-earth in the late\nThird Age. \n\n\nBiography\n\nWar of the Dwarves and Orcs\n\nDáin followed his grandfather, Grór, in lordship after Nain was killed\nby the great Orc chieftain Azog during the Battle of Azanulbizar, the\nfinal conflict in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, before he could\ninherit the lordship. Almost immediately after the death of Náin, Dáin\nrushed up the steps and slew Azog himself, thus avenging his father's\ndeath. He was a very young Dwarf at the time, being only thirty-two\nyears of age, by the Dwarves reckoning, he was still a stripling. Dáin's\nfeat was heralded as a magnificent and glorious triumph for one so\nyoung. Dáin alone looked past the gate into Moria, and had the wisdom to\nknow that it was impossible for the dwarves to return at that time. His\nkingdom at the Iron Hills was so great that they were the only people\ntruly capable of dealing with Sauron's forces at that time.\n===Battle of the Five Armies===\n\n\n\nDáin was the friend and cousin of Thorin Oakenshield, and responded to\nThorin's call for help during the quest to reclaim the Lonely\nMountain. Dáin marched with five hundred Dwarven soldiers,\nexceptionally strong even by Dwarven standards, clad in heavy chainmail\nand iron boots, and armed with mattocks, shields, and swords. He arrived\njust in time for the Battle of the Five Armies. After the battle,\nDain thanked the Eagles for their timely intervention, crowning their\nchief with gold and swearing the dwarves to everlasting friendship with\nthem. He also honored Thorin's committments to Bard the Bowman and Bilbo\nBaggins, giving a fourteenth share of the Mountain's treasure to the\npeople of Lake-town, and promising an even greater share to Bilbo, who\npolitely declined to take more than two small chests, filled with silver\nand gold. Dain also granted the emeralds of Girion to King Thranduil,\nwho prized them greatly.\n\nThe War of the Ring\n\n\n\nAfter Thorin's death, Dáin became King under the Mountain and King of\nDurin's folk, the first not to be in a direct line. Dáin was a wise and\njust leader, and brought much wealth to the mountain realm and was on\ngood terms with the Men of Dale in the south and the Elven king of\nNorthern Mirkwood as well, which ensured peace for many years to come.\nWhen Balin and other dwarves decided to reclaim Moria, Dáin initially\nrefused, but Balin insisted on going.\nA few months before the Council of Elrond, a messenger from Mordor\nappeared at the entrance of the Lonely Mountain and offered the Dwarves\nan alliance with Sauron, asking only in return that the Dwarves share\nwhat they knew “concerning Hobbits”, and help to track down the One\nRing, which the messenger described as “least of rings... a trifle that\nSauron fancies.”  The messenger said that, if the Dwarves could deliver\nthe Ring itself, then Sauron would return three of the Rings of Power\nthat originally belonged to the Dwarf-Lords, and Moria would be theirs\nto possess forever.  On the other hand, the messenger warned that\n“things will not seem so well” if the Dwarves did not help.\n\nSuspicious and apparently recognizing old enemies such as Orcs, Dain\nrefused to be bribed or blackmailed, and sent the messenger away without\nan answer, and instead sent Glóin to Rivendell, to consult with Elrond,\nwhile Dáin prepared the Lonely Mountain for war.\n\nDeath\n\nDáin participated in the\nWar of the Ring's northern campaign but was killed during the Battle of\nDale in TA 3019, defending the body of King Brand of Dale before the\ngates of the Lonely Mountain. He was, by then, an extremely old Dwarf,\nat the age of two-hundred and fifty-two, but still strong for his age.\nHe was still among the greatest of the Dwarven warriors, a direct\ndescendant of Durin and his prowess in battle was nearly unmatched.\n\nAfter news of his death reached Minas Tirith, Gandalf remarked that, as\nsaddened as they must be at Dáin's death, they should be glad that he\ndied in battle, defending his friend's body, as well as amazed that he\nwas still as formidable a warrior as he had been when he was a young\ndwarf: \n\n    _“I should call that a heavy loss, if it was not a wonder rather\n    that in his great age he could still wield his axe as mightily as\n    they say he did, standing over the body of King Brand before the\n    gate of Erebor, until the darkness fell.”_\n\nAfter his death during the war, his son, Thorin III Stonehelm, succeeded\nhim.\n\n\nAppearances in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Hobbit_ (First appearance)\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_ (Mentioned only)\n-   _The Return of the King_ (Mentioned only)\n-   _Unfinished Tales_\n\nIn the films\n\n-   _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_ (Mentioned only)\n-   ''The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies ''\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nRankin/Bass\n\nIn the animated film _The Hobbit_, Dain is referenced by Thorin as the\nleader of the dwarf reinforcements arriving at Erebor from the Iron\nHills, but is not seen in the film.\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\n\n\nIn the third volume of Peter Jackson's __Hobbit_ trilogy_, Dáin is\nportrayed by Scottish actor and comedian Billy Connolly. The character's\nhistory undergoes some drastic alteration, as the battle between him and\nAzog is instead combined with the account of how Thorin gained his\nsurname, and results in Azog losing an arm below the elbow rather than\nperishing.\n\nWhile the Lonely Mountain is under siege by a combined force of Mirkwood\nElves and Men from the recently-destroyed Lake-town, Dain arrives at the\nhead of an army of dwarves from the Iron Hills. Initially bent on\nattacking the elves, he wheels half of his army to fight against Azog's\narmy when it appears on the field. The Dwarves quickly formed a phalanx,\nin which fight he is reluctantly joined by the elves.\n\nAs the Orcs force the tired Dwarves back towards the gate of Erebor,\nThorin and his company charge out, prompting Dain to call for the\nDwarves to rally to their King. The two cousins exchange hearty\ngreetings on the battlefield, though Dain is not seen for the rest of\nthe film.\n\nIn battle, he rides a wild boar and wields a war hammer. After he is\nthrown off of his boar and loses his helmet, he is shown to have bright\nred hair, worn in a Mohawk (similar to Dwalin's at the time of the\nBattle of Azanulbizar).\n\nIn the extended edition for _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_\nhis role is slightly expanded, with his army briefly engaging the Elves\nuntil the arrival of the Orcs. Unlike the book, Dain's army contained\nmore than just heavily-armed infantry. In addition to having more than\nfive hundred heavy infantry armed with spears, swords, axes, and\nshields, Dain's army contained a force of two hundred fifty Dwarves\nmounted on armored goats, five war chariots manned by four dwarves each\nand pulled by teams of six rams, and nine heavy ballistae manned by\ncrews of five dwarves that fired javelins with spinning tails behind\nthem (called twirly-whirlies by Dain Ironfoot). After the battle, he is\ncrowned King under the Mountain and makes good the promise that Thorin\nmade to the people of Esgaroth by giving them the gold that was owed to\nhim. Although the extended edition of the third film does not show us\nwhat happened afterwards, it is possible to conclude that he made good\nthe promise that his cousin Thorin made to the people of Esgaroth by\ngiving them the gold that was owed to them, as well as restoring to\nThranduil the necklace of white gems that Thror stole from the\nElven-king years ago."

On Sméagol's birthday in TA 2463 they went fishing (or rather\nDéagol fished while Sméagol dug in the earth), and a big fish pulled\nDéagol underwater. It was then that he discovered the One Ring,\nhalf-buried in the river-bed. When Sméagol saw the Ring, he stared at it\nwith great desire, and then asked to keep it for his birthday. When his\ncousin refused, he broke into a barbaric rage and strangled Déagol to\nget it, hiding the body, which was never found, a deed that haunted\nGollum for the rest of his life.\n\nOf the Ring's bearers, Déagol carried it for the shortest collective\ntime, possessing it only for a few minutes. By contrast, the next\nshortest, Samwise Gamgee, carried it for a full day, and all the other\nRing-bearers held it for at least a year.

He was\nknown as a great warrior, a wise king, and a heroic figure among the\nDúnedain, who loved every man, woman and child of Arnor and Gondor, and\nwas loved by them in return. He was killed by Sauron during the War of\nthe Last Alliance. He was known as the greatest warrior of all the\nDúnedain.\n\n\nBiography\n\nLife in Númenor\n\nElendil was born in 3119 of the Second Age in Númenor, son of Amandil,\nLord of Andúnië and leader of the “Faithful” (those who remained loyal\nto the Valar), who maintained a strong friendship with the elves and\npreserved the old ways against the practices of Ar-Pharazôn and Sauron.\nHe was married to an unnamed Númenórean woman no doubt of the same\nupbringing and noble blood to which they had two sons: Isildur and\nAnárion. It is not known whether she followed him to Middle-earth after\nthe Fall of Númenor.\n\nFounder of Arnor and Gondor\n\nElendil, his sons Isildur and Anárion, and their supporters fled to\nMiddle-earth at the Downfall of Númenor, sailing east in nine ships and\nfounding the realms of Arnor and Gondor in Middle-earth in SA 3320. With\nthem, they took the _Palantiri_, the “Seeing Stones” that were given to\nthe Lords of Andúnie by the elves of Tol Eressëa, and a seedling of\nNimloth, the White Tree of Númenor.\n\nAs he landed on Middle-earth Elendil proclaimed in Quenya: _Et Eärello\nEndorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta_ - “Out\nof the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. In this place will I abide,\nand my heirs, unto the ending of the world.” His heir and\n89-great-grandson Aragorn spoke these traditional words again when he\ntook up the crown of Gondor at the beginning of the Fourth Age.\n\nElendil lived in Arnor, where he founded the city of Annúminas. His son\nAnárion founded the city of Minas Anor in Anórien, and his son Isildur\nfounded Minas Ithil in Ithilien. Across the Anduin, the city of\nOsgiliath was built. Across the realms towers were built for the\n_Palantíri_, with which the realms kept contact.\n\nLast Alliance of Elves and Men\n\n\n\nIn time Sauron returned to Middle-earth, establishing a stronghold in\nMordor, next to Gondor. In SA 3428, he attacked seizing Minas Ithil.\nIsildur fled north to his father, leaving Anárion in charge of Gondor.\nIn SA 3434, Elendil and Isildur returned south together with the Elven\nHigh King Gil-galad and their combined armies, in the Last Alliance of\nElves and Men.\n\nAfter defeating Sauron's armies and advancing into Mordor itself, the\narmies of Men and Elves settled into a siege of the main tower of\nSauron: Barad-dûr. During this siege Anárion was killed.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the long siege in the year SA 3441, Sauron came out to\npersonally do battle with his enemies. Elendil, together with the\nElven-king Gil-galad, overthrew Sauron, but they were both killed in the\nprocess, and Elendil's sword broke when he fell.\n\nElendil's son Isildur used his father's broken sword to cut the One Ring\nfrom Sauron's hand. Vanquished, Sauron's spirit fled. Isildur built a\nhidden tomb for his father on the summit of the beacon hill of\nHalifirien.\n\nLegacy\n\nLeading the remnant of The Faithful Númenóreans to Middle-earth, Elendil\nestablished strong regimes there and created the great alliance that put\nan end to Sauron's power for over a thousand years. His bloodline and\nspirited leadership survived in the Dúnedain of the North and South of\nMiddle-earth, that would in turn sire the brave and heroic Men that\nwould help bring a final end to Sauron in the War of the Ring.\n\nAragorn's battle-cry in the _The Lord of the Rings_ was _ELENDIL!._\n\nThe Oath of Elendil\n\nLyrics, in Quenya:\n_Et Eärello\nEndorenna utúlien\nSinome Maruvan\nar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-Metta_\n\nTranslation:\n_Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come.\nIn this place I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the\nworld.'\"_\n\nThis oath was sung an age later by Aragorn II Elessar, during his\ncoronation at the end of the War of the Ring.\n\n\nPortrayal in Adaptations\n\nPeter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy\n\nElendil makes brief appearance in Peter Jackson's ''The Fellowship of\nthe Ring _at the Battle of the Last Alliance_,'' and was played by Peter\nMcKenzie. Unlike in the books, Elendil is killed by a blow from Sauron\nattempting to do battle, instead of in a duel with him alongside\nGil-galad. Instead Isildur alone deals the fatal blow to the\nstill-living Sauron by cutting off his fingers with the broken blade of\nNarsil, and with them the One Ring. Another deviation is Elendil's\nheight; he is shown to be near the same height as most of his troops."

Through their mother Celebrían, they are the only\ngrandsons of Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn of Lothlórien.\n\nIn TA 2509, the brothers rescued their mother from her imprisonment with\nthe Orcs. Although she was physically healed by Elrond, after fear and\ntorment from the Orcs she lost all joy from Middle-earth, and so she\ndeparted for the Grey Havens the next year. Due to this, the twins\nharbored great hatred for Orcs.\n\nBy the year TA 2933, Elladan and Elrohir went riding against Orcs with\nArathorn II, the father of Aragorn. There Arathorn was slain and his\nwife and son went to dwell in Imladris, where Elrond received Aragorn as\nhis foster-son, naming him _Estel_.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nWhen the Fellowship arrived in Rivendell, the twin's role was to scout\nthe lands and prepare the way for the Fellowship. Later, they\ntraveled along with Halbarad and the Grey Company. They delivered a\nmessage from their father concerning the Paths of the Dead and followed\nAragorn, Legolas and Gimli there. Elladan traveled behind the company,\nthe Dead following after him. They battled in the Fields of Pelennor\n“with stars bound to their brows.”\n\nDuring the last council, Elladan and Elrohir seconded Mithrandir's\ndecision to throw the remaining troops of Gondor and Rohan at the\nMorannon, saying that Elrond had sent them with that same counsel from\nRivendell. Elladan and Elrohir also accompanied Aragorn and fought\nalongside him at the Black Gate.\n\nAfter the War\n\nAfter the war, Elladan and Elrohir met the escort of Arwen in\nLothlorien, and together, they travel to Edoras. The brothers arrived\nfirst and carried a banner of silver. They were followed by Glorfindel\nand Erestor.\n\nFourth Age (and beyond)\n\nWhen their father departed to the West, the brothers stayed in Rivendell\nfor a while. In time, their grandfather Celeborn came to live with them\nbefore passing into the Grey Havens. It is unknown whether Elladan\nand Elrohir chose to remain in Middle-Earth as mortal men or depart with\nthe last of their kindred to Valinor.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _ELLADAN_ is Sindarin for “Elf-Man” or “Elf-Dúnadan,” referring\nto his dual descent from both Elves and Edain (a house of Men from\nBeleriand). It comes from the words _el_ (“elf or star”) and _adan_,\nsingular of Edain. On the other hand, _ELROHIR_ means “Elf-knight”,\nbut _rochir_ also means “horse-lord”.\n\n\nCharacter\n\n \n\nThough Tolkien never specifically states that Elrohir and Elladan were\ntwins, it is suspected that they were for four reasons: first, they are\ndescribed as “So much alike were they, the sons of Elrond, that few\ncould tell them apart: dark-haired, grey-eyed, and their faces\nelven-fair, clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey”\n(Tolkien 761). Secondly, one is rarely mentioned without the other,\nand their names are only separated when they are speaking. Thirdly, they\nwere both born in the same year, and elven pregnancies last a full\nyear.  Fourthly, the birth of twins was not a rare occurrence in\ntheir family history (Amrod and Amras, Eluréd and Elurín, Elrond and\nElros).\n\nThe brethren were friends and companions-in-arms of the Rangers of the\nNorth, and helped defend the remnants of Arnor from evil after the fall\nof the northern kingdom. They held a special grudge against orcs because\nof their mother's suffering at their hands.\n\nLike their sister, father, and uncle, they could make a choice between\nmortality and immortality, expressed by whether they would follow their\nfather to Valinor at the time of his own departure at the end of the\nThird Age. Since they are explicitly described as remaining in Rivendell\nfor a time after their father's departure, some fans speculated that\nthey had also chosen mortality. However, J.R.R. Tolkien himself noted\nthat the twins were allowed to “delay” their choices.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn early writings, Elladan and Elrohir were named “Elboron and\nElbereth.” These were the same early names for the twins Eluréd and\nElurín, who were the uncles of Elrond. They also had a younger\nsister named Finduilas, who was later renamed Arwen. In this version,\nElladan and Elrohir's birth date was TA 2349.\n\n\nAppearances in the Books\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_ (Mentioned only)\n-   _The Return of the King_\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nFan Work\n\n\n\nElladan and Elrohir also appear in the fan-made film, _Born of Hope_ and\nwere played by the twin brother actors Sam Kennard and Matt Kennard.\n\nVideo games\n\nThey also appeared in the _Lord of the Rings: War in the North_ video\ngame. They are seen in the first level at Fornost by the three main\ncharacters of the game: Eradan (ranger), Farin (champion), and Andriel.\nThey leave behind them many dead orcs and goblins. When Elladan and\nElrohir meet the three heroes, just after the heroes have finished\nfighting a troll, they decide to work together to reach the City's\ncitadel.\n\n\n\nWhen they arrive at the citadel, Elrohir and Elladan go after the leader\nof the dark forces here in Fornost, also the main villain of the game:\nAgandaur. They are seen dueling him atop the citadel. Their duel with\nhim is finished after Eradan, Andriel, and Farin arrive - after killing\nsome of Agandaur's orcs and his chieftain Tharzog - forcing Agandaur to\nretreat on a fell beast. The Great Eagle Beleram goes after Agandaur,\nwho loses the Eagle by creating a storm with his dark sorcery. With\ntheir job done in Fornost, Elladan and Elrohir returned to Rivendell,\nwhile the other three went back to Sarn Ford, and Beleram went back to\nreport to Gwaihir the Eagle Lord.\n\nThey are seen again in Rivendell as characters that can be spoken\nto."

    "text": "ELROND (Sindarin; IPA: “Star-Dome”) Half-elven, LORD OF RIVENDELL, was\none of the mighty Elf-rulers of old who lived in Middle-earth from the\nFirst Age to the beginning of the Fourth Age. He was the father of Arwen\nUndomiel, lover of Aragorn II Elessar.\n\n\nBiography\n\nFirst Age\n\n\n\nElrond Half-elven is the son of Eärendil and Elwing, and a\ngreat-grandson of Lúthien. He was born in the refuge of the Havens of\nSirion in Beleriand late in the First Age, soon before its sack by the\nSons of Fëanor. Elrond and his twin brother Elros were captured and\nraised by Maedhros and Maglor, the Sons of Fëanor. Though at first there\nwas no great love between them, eventually Maglor took pity on them and\ncherished them, and eventually grew to love them. By the end of the\nFirst Age and the War of Wrath, the Sons of Fëanor were again working\nalone, suggesting that by this time Elrond and Elros had left their\nnominal captivity and traveled to Lindon.\n\nSecond Age\n\nElrond and Elros were given the choice at the end of the First Age to be\ncounted among Men or Elves. Elros chose the Fate of Men and became Elros\nTar-Minyatur, the first King of Númenor. Elrond chose to be counted\namong the Elves, and remained in Lindon as captain and herald of\nGil-Galad, the High King of the Ñoldor.\n\nIn SA 1695, Elrond was sent to Eregion by Gil-galad in an attempt to\nprotect it from the invading forces of Sauron. Unfortunately, Elrond's\nhost was too weak and was unable to hold off Sauron's army. He retreated\nnorth with a host of elves out of Eregion including Celeborn and\nremained ever watchful of Sauron from there. It was during the following\ntwo years (SA 1697) that Elrond founded Rivendell at the feet of the\nMisty Mountains, which survived as one of the last remaining strongholds\nagainst Sauron at the end of the Third Age.\n\nAfter the combined forces of the elves under Gil-Galad, Cirdan, Elrond\nand the Men of Númenor defeated Sauron in SA 1701 Elrond remained in\nRivendell and hosted the first White Council, attended by Galadriel, at\nwhich it was decided that Elrond's home, the Last Homely House, would\nremain the last stronghold west of the Misty Mountains, and that the\nThree Rings then held by Gil-Galad and Galadriel would remain hidden.\nAccording to one account Gil-Galad at this time gave Elrond Vilya the\nBlue Ring, though in other accounts Gil-Galad kept both Narya and Vilya\nuntil the end of the Second Age. It was also here that Elrond first met\nCelebrían, the daughter of Celeborn and Galadriel.\n\n\n\nNear the end of the Second Age, Elrond rode beside Gil-Galad in the Last\nAlliance of Elves and Men, which set out from Rivendell to Mordor in SA\n3431. Elrond was Gil-galad's herald during the war against Sauron. The\nAlliance, which also included elves from Lorien, men from Arnor and\nGondor, and Dwarves led by Durin lV, eventually defeated Sauron's army\nand laid siege to Barad-dûr for seven years. Eventually, Sauron himself\nwas defeated by Elendil and Gil-galad, allowing Isildur to cut the One\nRing from Sauron's finger and claim the Ring for himself.\n\nThe Last Alliance of Elves and Men took a toll on the forces of both\nElves and Men. Gil-Galad, Elendil, and his younger son Anarion were\nkilled in the siege. Elrond and Cirdan only remained as the commanders\nof the elves, and Isildur as lord of men. Upon discovering that Isildur\nhad claimed the One Ring for himself Elrond urged Isildur to throw the\nRing into the fires of Mount Doom, but the seduction of the ring made\nIsildur refuse. Isildur claimed the Ring as a Weregild for his father\nand brother, and Elrond (perhaps not fully understanding the nature of\nthe One Ring) acknowledged his claim. Isildur was then named High King\nof Gondor and Arnor and took his father's throne, while Elrond returned\nto Rivendell at the end of the war.\n\nThird Age\n\n\n\nIn the year TA 109, Elrond wedded Celebrían. In the year TA 130, the\ntwins Elladan and Elrohir were born, and in TA 241 a daughter, Arwen\nUndómiel. Elrond lost Celebrían in TA 2510 when she was waylaid by orcs\ncrossing the Misty Mountains and, unable to recover, took a ship to the\nUndying Lands.\n\nIn the later years, he was instrumental in harboring the heirs of\nIsildur while the line lasted, the most famous of these sons of men was\nAragorn son of Arathorn II, whom he took in and fostered as his own\nafter his father died in TA 2933. Elrond, foreseeing the boy's difficult\nfuture gave him the name Estel, Sindarin for Hope. Aragorn grew up in\nImladris unaware of his kingly lineage until Elrond told him when he had\nreached his manhood.\n\nHe also was a member of the White Council, which was often held in\nRivendell, and was a great friend of Gandalf the Grey. He helped Thorin\nOakenshield's expedition to retake the Lonely Mountain by discovering\nand translating the Moon Writing on Thorin's map.\n\nAfter Frodo's departure from the Shire with the One Ring, Elrond sent\nout riders to help guide him back to Rivendell. One of these,\nGlorfindel, successfully found Frodo and helped him reach Rivendell.\nOn October 25, 3018 he held the Council at which it was decided to\nattempt to destroy the One Ring. He appeared to have selected the\nmembers of the Fellowship other than Frodo and Sam.\n\nLater, Elrond sent his sons Elladan and Elrohir with the Rangers of the\nNorth to Rohan. Through his sons, Elrond advised Aragorn to take the\nPaths of the Dead.\n\n\n\nElrond remained in Rivendell until the destruction of the One Ring and\nof Sauron, after which he went to Minas Tirith to surrender the Sceptre\nof Annúminas to King Elessar and give his daughter Arwen Undómiel away\nto be married. On September 29, 3021, Elrond left Middle-earth to go\nover the sea with the other Ring-bearers, never to return.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nELROND is a Sindarin name that means “Star-dome” or “Elf of the cave”,\nfrom _el_ (“Elf” or “star”, interchangeably) and _rond_ (“cave,\nvault”).\n\n\nCharacter\n\nElrond was a skillful warrior in battle and had commanded various armies\nof the Free Peoples well, including the Last Alliance. He was just as\neffective at leadership and gave much wise counsel. He had the gift of\nforesight through which he could view lands and events far away from\nRivendell. He was also adept at healing others, though whether through\nmedical knowledge or magic isn't known. The latter may be more probable\nin that Elrond managed to cure a Morgul wound, something which is almost\ninvariably fatal due to its association with dark sorcery. While it is\nunknown just how powerful Elrond is compared to other Elf Lords, he\ncertainly holds vast potential, being descended from the angelic Maia\nMelian and being the wielder of the ring of power Vilya. A notable\ndemonstration includes Elrond summoning a great flood on the River\nBruinen to sweep away the Nazgûl. Elrond was also familiar with ósanwe,\nthe skill of entering others' minds. After the destruction of the One\nRing Elrond communicated mentally with Galadriel and Gandalf on their\nreturn journey from Minas Tirith.\n\nElrond was one of the most incorruptible of leaders of Middle-earth.\nAragorn speculated that among the few capable of completely resisting\nSaruman's power of speech were Elrond, Galadriel, and Gandalf. Elrond\nalso rejected and opposed Sauron when the latter offered partnership\nwith the Elves.\n\n\nAppearances in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n-   _The Hobbit_\n-   _The Silmarillion_\n-   _Unfinished Tales_\n-   _The History of Middle-earth_\n\nIn the films\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n-   _An Unexpected Journey_\n-   _The Battle of the Five Armies_\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Lord of the Rings trilogy\n\n\n\nElrond appears extensively in Peter Jackson's film trilogy. He appears\nin all three films, portrayed by Hugo Weaving.\n\nJackson's characterization of Elrond departs in several ways from\nTolkien's own. Like the other elves, Elrond is somewhat aloof in the\nfilms. He distrusts the race of men, although he knows that the time of\nthe elves is over. In a significant change from the books, he is\ndistressed at the thought of Arwen becoming mortal for the sake of\nAragorn, and initially suggests she leave Middle-earth for Valinor.\nThough wise and virtuous, Jackson's Elrond appears unconvinced that\nSauron can be defeated. Some have drawn similarities between Jackson's\nportrayal of the elves, and of Elrond in particular, and the portrayal\nof the highly rational Vulcan race in _Star Trek_, or to Tolkien's own\ncharacterization of the elf Thingol, who does not appear in the films.\n\nIn _The Fellowship of the Ring_, Elrond is first seen in the prologue at\nthe Battle of Dagorlad as a lieutenant of the Ñoldor. He later appears\nin Rivendell, having summoned a council of men, dwarves, and elves to\ndecide the fate of the One Ring. After some heated discussion, Elrond\ndeclares that the Ring must be destroyed in Mount Doom. Frodo volunteers\nto be the Ring-bearer, and Elrond titles Frodo and his companions the\nFellowship of the Ring. Elrond also recounts a flashback to Gandalf in\nwhich he witnesses Isildur's refusal to destroy the Ring, an event that\nmakes Elrond forever suspicious of men.\n\nIn _The Two Towers_, Elrond tries to convince Arwen to choose\nimmortality and depart for Valinor, where her love for Aragorn may\n“bloom evergreen.” After Elrond tells Arwen that he has foreseen her\nwidowhood and eventual death, she emotionally agrees to take his\nfather's counsel and leave Middle-earth. Later in the film, Elrond\ncommunicates telepathically with Galadriel regarding the fate of Rohan.\nHe agrees to send a contingent of elvish warriors to aid Théoden's men\nat Helm's Deep. (Strangely, the elves that arrive at Helm's Deep near\nthe beginning of the Battle of the Hornburg are from Lothlórien, not\nRivendell.)\n\nIn _The Return of the King_, Arwen confronts Elrond early in the film\nafter witnessing a vision of her own future son, Eldarion. Realizing\nthat Arwen's love for Aragorn cannot be overcome, Elrond agrees to\nreforge Narsil, the sword of Elendil, into Andúril. Later, Elrond\ndelivers Andúril to Aragorn at Dunharrow, and urges him to reclaim the\nthrone of Gondor and take command of the Army of the Dead. Elrond does\nnot appear again until the film's epilogue, where he presents Arwen to\nAragorn at the latter's coronation. Elrond appears one last time at the\nGrey Havens, whence he departs Middle-earth with Gandalf, Celeborn,\nGaladriel, Bilbo, and Frodo.\n\n_The Hobbit_ film trilogy\n\n\n\nHugo Weaving reprises his role as Elrond in Jackson's _The Hobbit_\ntrilogy, appearing in the first and third installments. His role is\nexpanded from his brief appearance in Tolkien's original novel.\n\nElrond initially appears in _An Unexpected Journey_ when the elves of\nRivendell ambush the Warg-riders chasing Thorin and Company. Elrond\nwields Hadhafang (Arwen's sword in _The Fellowship of the Ring_) and is\naccompanied by Lindir. He warmly welcomes Gandalf and Thorin into\nRivendell and identifies their respective swords, Glamdring and Orcrist.\n\nWhen Elrond inquires as to why they were journeying on the great east\nroad, Gandalf persuades Thorin to show Elrond the map of Erebor. Thorin\nis reluctant, but in his desperation he hands Elrond the map. Elrond\nrealises that the writing is written in moon runes. He holds the map\nunder the moonlight and translates the ancient writing, revealing the\nsecret passage into the Lonely Mountain. He then deduces that Thorin\nintends to enter the mountain and reclaim the treasure. Elrond is\nskeptical of the dwarves' ability to succeed.\n\nElrond feels that Gandalf should explain Thorin's quest to the White\nCouncil, and the two meet with Galadriel and Saruman. Elrond at first is\ndoubtful of Gandalf's warnings about the possibility of Sauron's return,\nbut when Gandalf reveals the Morgul-blade from Dol Goldur, Elrond is\nhorrified. He explains that the tombs of the _Nazgûl_ are protected by\npowerful spells. He is then notified by Lindir that the dwarves have\nleft Rivendell.\n\nElrond reappears in _The Battle of the Five Armies_ when he, Saruman,\nand Galadriel rescue Gandalf from Dol Guldur. Elrond and Saruman reveal\nthemselves just as Galadriel and Gandalf are surrounded by the specters\nof the _Nazgûl_. Elrond quips they should have remained dead before he\nsubsequently duels with them, visibly wielding his ring Vilya. He\nnotably holds his own against several wraiths at once, before they are\nall defeated. He attempts to defend Galadriel as Sauron manifests before\nthem, along with all of the Nine. Elrond then watches on in amazement as\nGaladriel takes on a terrifying form to repel Sauron., After Sauron and\nthe _Nazgûl_ are cast into the East, Elrond urges a pursuit of Sauron.\nSaruman instructs Elrond to take Galadriel back to Lothlórien, promising\nto pursue Sauron himself."

In TA\n3002, when Éomer was eleven, Éomund was slain in battle with Orcs.\nTheodwyn died of grief shortly afterward. Éomund also had a daughter\nnamed Éowyn, Éomer's sister. After they were orphaned Théoden adopted\nthem as his own children.\n\nÉomer became the third Marshal of the Mark, and was a strong leader of\nMen. He was honored highly, prized extensively by the king, and was good\nfriends with Théodred, son of Théoden who loved him like a brother.\n\nHis éored hunted down the Uruk-hai that had taken Meriadoc Brandybuck\nand Peregrin Took as they camped near Fangorn forest, slaying them all.\nHe never saw the Hobbits, as they had fled during the battle. Afterwards\nhe met Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas in the plains of Rohan, and he lent\nthem two horses, Arod and Hasufel.\n\nÉomer returned to Edoras and reported on meeting the Ranger and friends\nand allowing them to go free, a violation of the king's law. Under the\npoisonous advice of Gríma Wormtongue, he was imprisoned by Théoden, who\nhad grown weak, aged, and suspicious under Saruman the White's\ninfluence.\n\nAfter Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas reunited with Gandalf, the four\nhastened to Edoras, where Gandalf broke Saruman's influence over Théoden\nand restored him to health and vitality. Théoden freed Éomer, who\noffered his sword to Théoden in token of his loyalty. Théoden named\nÉomer his heir prior to riding away from Edoras to the defense of the\nHornburg.\n\n\n\nAt the Battle of the Hornburg, he and his éored drove the orcs and\nDunlendings of Saruman into the walls of the Glittering Caves and in the\nHuorn forest, where they were killed. One of the main defences that\nÉomer was involved in was the defence of the gate where he, Aragorn, and\na small band of men left through a small door at the side of the\nHornburg and led an assault on the forces attempting to break the gates\nof the Hornburg. After this attack Éomer and Aragorn attempted to return\nthrough the door when Éomer was jumped upon by several orcs who had laid\nlow during the assault though Éomer was saved by Gimli who had secretly\nfollowed him out to the gate.\n\nAfterwards he rode with Théoden, Aragorn, and Gandalf to Isengard, where\nthey were greeted by Merry and Pippin, who were celebrating their recent\nvictory. Treebeard and his fellow Ents, remained as well in order to\nguard the now imprisoned Saruman and Wormtongue.\n\nAfter the “Warning beacons of Gondor” were lit, Théoden agreed to gather\nwhat forces he had to help defend the city of Minas Tirith against the\nimpending battle with the forces of Mordor. Théoden and Eomer manged to\nrally six thousand soldiers, before travelling to “The White City”. The\narmies of Rohan, manged to arrive at the Pelennor Fields, just before\nthe City Gates could be breached. Eomer fought gallantly, slaying many\nfoes. But Théoden was fatally crushed by his horse, Snowmane, after\nbeing thrown by the Witch King's Fell Beast. Coming upon their corpses,\nEomer was driven to temporary madness at seeing Éowyn, his sister, among\nthe King's retinue, apparently dead, and charged in renewed fury at the\nforces of Mordor. He and Aragorn met on the battlefield and reaffirmed\ntheir loyalty to each other, before returning to the long, grim work of\nwinning the battle.\n\nIn the battle's aftermath, Éomer attended to Éowyn in the Houses of\nHealing, and, with Aragorn and Meriadoc Brandybuck, helped call his\nsister Éowyn back to consciousness. Aragorn said that, as broken as\nEowyn's heart had been over her unrequited love for Aragorn, her love\nfor her brother was much more real to her, and a much more potent reason\nfor her to live.\n\nÉomer became King of the Mark upon Théoden's death. Following the\nbattle, Éomer and his men went back to Edoras to attend to affairs of\nthe kingdom, returning later to bear the body of Théoden back to his\nhome for burial.\n\n\n\nÉomer renewed the Oath of Eorl with Aragorn after Aragorn had been\ncrowned King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom, and Éomer had been crowned\nKing of Rohan, swearing everlasting friendship between Rohan and Gondor\n(and legalizing Cirion's grant of Calenardhon to the Éothéod.)\n\nHe became known as ÉOMER ÉADIG, or “the Blessed”, because during his\nreign Rohan recovered from the hurts of the War and became a rich and\nfruitful land again.\n\nÉomer had met Lothíriel, daughter of Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth during\nhis stay in Gondor, and they were wed. She bore him a son Elfwine, who\nsucceeded his father, after Éomer's death in the year FO 63.\n\n\nWeapons\n\nÉomer's sword was called _Gúthwinë_ (Old English for “battle-friend”).\nHe also used a spear.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ÉOMER_ means “one who is famous in terms of horses” (Old English). The\nidea for his name was derived from the Anglo-Saxon words “eoh”\n(“war-horse”), “maer” (famous), and “éadig” (“blessed”).\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nThe name _Éomer_ appears as the name of a King of the Angles, both in\nboth the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, in which he is the son of Angeltheow\nand grandson of Offa and, in its West Saxon form Ēomǣr, in the epic poem\n_Beowulf,_ in which he was the son of Offa and Modthryth and grandson of\nWermund.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nLord of the Rings trilogy\n\nIn the _Lord of the Rings_ film trilogy by Peter Jackson, Éomer is\nexiled by Gríma Wormtongue before meeting Aragorn, and is an outcast\nuntil he arrives at Helm's Deep, summoned by Gandalf. In this sense, his\ncharacter has been combined with the character of Erkenbrand, who, in\nthe book, is the one with whom Gandalf returns to Helm's Deep. At the\nBattle of the Pelennor Fields in the third film, Éomer kills the Chief\nof the mumakil riders.

Felaróf\nbecame Eorl's steed and was the father of the Mearas, who were the\nsteeds of Eorl's descendants. It was also said that Felaróf would not\npermit any other man to ride him.\n\nEorl succeeded his father as the leader of the Éothéod. They were a\nnumerous people with many horses. They needed more room to roam, but\nthere was nowhere for them to go.\n\nOn March 25, TA 2510 - when Eorl was twenty-five years old - an\nerrand-rider named Borondir arrived with a message from Cirion, the\nSteward of Gondor. Gondor was being threatened by Men from Rhun called\nthe Balchoth, and Cirion sought Eorl's help in defeating them. Eorl\nagreed to come, because he knew that if Gondor fell, all of Middle-earth\nwould soon be conquered. Borondir was one of several errand riders sent\nout by the Stewards, but the only one to get through, due to the\nintervening enemies. Eorl assembled his Council of Elders to prepare to\nride south.\n\nOn April 6 , Eorl rode forth with an Éored - or mounted army - of 7,000\nfully armed Riders and several hundred mounted archers. Only a few\nhundred Riders were left behind to guard the women, children, and\nelderly. The eohere rode southward through the Vales of the Anduin - a\njourney of over 500 miles.\n\nWhen they passed Dol Guldur in Mirkwood - where Sauron dwelled in secret\n- a darkness emanated from the fortress, and Eorl turned westward to\navoid it. But then a white mist came from the woods of Lothlorien that\nstood across the River from Dol Guldur, and the Riders were hidden and\ncontinued safely on their way and, under the protection of the mist,\napparently made the journey unwearyingly at an extraordinary rate of\nspeed.\n\nEorl arrived at the Field of Celebrant on the morning of April 15.\nGondor's army was being attacked on two fronts by the Balchoth and orcs\nfrom the Misty Mountains. Eorl and his Riders attacked the enemy from\nthe rear, slaying many and driving the rest across the River Limlight.\nSouth of the Limlight lay the province of Gondor called Calenardhon, and\nEorl and his Riders pursued the surviving enemies until the land was\nfree of them.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Field of Celebrant, Eorl accompanied Cirion to\nthe Mering Stream on the southeastern border of Calenardhon, where they\nparted company. Cirion asked Eorl to meet him there again in three\nmonths and committed Calenardhon to Eorl's care in the meantime.\n\n\n\nWhen they met again in August of 2510, Cirion brought Eorl to\nHalifirien, the Hill of Awe (also known as Amon Anwar because, unknown\nto all but the Steward and those in his deepest confidence, the Tomb of\nElendil had stood since being placed there by Isildur after the fall of\nSauron, in the Firien wood). There Cirion offered Eorl the land of\nCalenardhon as a new homeland for his people in gratitude for their\nservice to Gondor. Eorl was deeply grateful for the Gift of Cirion, whom\nhe admired as the wisest of all men then in Middle-earth. He accepted\nand he swore an Oath that his people would always come to Gondor's aid\nin time of need. Eorl realized that their peoples needed to remain\nallies in order to face the growing danger in Middle-earth. Cirion took\na similar oath on behalf of the people of Gondor.\n\nEorl left about half his force to guard Calenardhon and returned to the\nfar north to gather his people and their possessions. He led them back\nto their new homeland, and it became known as the Mark. In Gondor, the\nnew land of their allies was called Rohan.\n\nEorl was King of the Mark for 35 years. He chose the hill at the\nentrance to the valley of Harrowdale to be the site of the town of\nEdoras. But Meduseld, the Golden Hall, was not completed in Eorl's\nlifetime, and he dwelled at Aldburg in the Folde. Eorl's son Brego was\nborn in TA 2512.\n\nIn TA 2545, Rohan was attacked by Easterlings. The attack was thwarted,\nbut Eorl fell in battle. He was buried in a mound outside Edoras, and\nhis horse Felarof was buried with him. His son Brego succeeded him as\nKing of Rohan.\n\nRohan continued to be ruled by the House of Eorl, and the people of\nRohan called themselves the Eorlingas, or the Sons of Eorl. The Oath of\nEorl was not forgotten. During the War of the Ring, King Theoden of\nRohan honored his ancestor's Oath and came to Gondor's aid at the Battle\nof the Pelennor Fields. The Oath of Eorl was renewed by Theoden's\nsuccessor King Eomer, who pledged continued friendship to Aragorn, King\nElessar, of the Reunited Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor.\n\nde:Eorl es:Eorl it:Eorl nl:Eorl de Jonge pl:Eorl ru:Эорл"

    "name": "Éowyn",
    "lotrUrl": "https://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/%C3%89owyn",
    "race": "Human",
    "text": "ÉOWYN was a shieldmaiden of Rohan, daughter of Éomund and Theodwyn,\nyounger sister of Éomer and niece of King Théoden. After the War of the\nRing, she married Faramir and had one son with him, Elboron.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nÉowyn was the second child of Éomund and Theodwyn. Like her brother\nÉomer, she was related to King Théoden through their mother, the King's\nsister. Her father was slain and her mother died of illness in TA 3002.\nAfterwards, Théoden took Éomer and Éowyn in his household and raised\nthem as his children.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Éowyn was forced to stay in Meduseld and\ncare for her declining uncle for several years, as he was weakened by\nthe influence of Saruman and Gríma Wormtongue. When Gandalf restored the\nKing, he prepared to defend Rohan against Isengard. Since Théoden\nplanned to ride to battle himself, he asked his doorwarden Háma, to\nsuggest a leader for the people in his absence. Háma recommended Éowyn,\nwho, though a woman, was “fearless” and “all love her.”\n\nÉowyn reluctantly obeyed the King's orders to stay behind in Edoras\nwhile Aragorn, Théoden, and the rest of the men confronted Saruman's\narmy at the Battle of the Hornburg. When they returned, victorious to\nEdoras, Éowyn had kept everything in perfect order for their return. It\nwas near this time when she confessed her growing feelings for Aragorn,\nbut he reluctantly refused.\n\nWhen Denethor II urgently called for Théoden's aid against Mordor, Éowyn\nagain, begged to be allowed to ride with Aragorn to battle, but he\nrefused.\n\nIn bitterness, she disguised herself as a man, under the alias Dernhelm,\nand rode to Minas Tirith on her horse Windfola. She took Meriadoc\nBrandybuck along because he likewise wanted to follow his friends to\nbattle, but had been refused by Théoden. Because Éowyn weighed less than\na man of similar height, Windfola was able to bear both her and\nMerry.  During the Battle\nof the Pelennor Fields, she fought in Théoden's escort; when he and his\ncompany were attacked by the Witch-king of Angmar, lord of the Nazgûl,\nshe and Merry were the only riders who did not flee. As Théoden lay\nmortally wounded, she challenged the Witch-King, who boasted that “no\nliving man may hinder me.” In answer, she removed her helmet, exposing\nher long blond hair, and declared, _“No living man am I! You look upon a\nwoman! Éowyn I am, Éomund's daughter. Begone if you be not deathless!\nFor living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him!”_\n\nIn a rage, the Witch-king attacked her, but she cleaved the head off his\nFell Beast. The Witch-king shattered her shield with a blow of his mace,\nbreaking her arm, but stumbled when Merry stabbed his leg from behind\nwith a Barrow-blade of Westernesse make. Éowyn stabbed her sword through\nthe Witch-king's head, killing him, and thus fulfilling Glorfindel's\nprophecy a thousand years earlier at the Battle of Fornost that “not by\nthe hand of man” would the Witch-King fall.\n\n\n\nHer constitution already severely weakened by her loneliness and\ndespair, combined with her physical injuries, Éowyn succumbed to a\nsevere case of the Black Breath. Théoden, not knowing that she was\nnearby, told Merry with his dying words that she had been “dearer than\ndaughter” to him.\n\nSeeing her lying apparently dead on the battlefield caused her brother\nÉomer to go temporarily mad, and charge in fury at the enemy. But during\nthe battle she was found by Prince Imrahil, who noticed that she was\nstill alive, though barely, and ordered her taken to the Houses of\nHealing. There she was healed by Aragorn, the cure of the plant Athelas,\nand the entreaties of her distraught brother.\n\n\n\nÉowyn remained behind in Minas Tirith while the Army of the West marched\ntoward Morannon, the Black Gate, to challenge Sauron. She met and fell\nin love with Faramir, who had likewise been injured before the battle.\nAfter the War of the Ring had ended, she decided to give up dreams of\nglory in battle and devote her life to peace and a happy marriage.\n\nLater years\n\nAt Éowyn's insistence, Merry was made a Knight of the Riddermark. He\nattended Théoden's funeral and Éomer's coronation as King of Rohan,\nwhere Éowyn presented Merry with a parting gift: the Horn of Rohan, a\nsmall silver horn taken from the hoard of Scatha, the dragon.\n\nFaramir and Éowyn settled in Ithilien, where they had at least one son\n(likely Elboron), and their grandson was Barahir, who wrote _The Tale of\nAragorn and Arwen_ in the Fourth Age. The date of Éowyn's death is\nnowhere recorded.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Éowyn_ means “horse lover” in Anglo-Saxon (the language Tolkien used to\nrepresent Rohirric).\n\nThe name was derived from an old Welsh name, _Øwyn_ - slightly altered\nto sound like “A-O-win”. The name in Welsh means “Horse friend”, with\nthe prefix _Éo-_ meaning 'horse' and the suffix ''-wyn ''(“whün”)\nmeaning 'friend.'\n\nPronunciation\n\nThe first syllable of Éowyn's name is pronounced “eh-ah,” with the “ah”\njust barely pronounced. The second syllable pronounced is slightly\ndifferent than it looks, however, being in Welsh it is pronounced “een;”\nthe sound it makes together in an “Eh-awe-een,” having the “w” barely\npronounced at all, instead the word creates its own soft “w” without the\nvoluntary sound, as in Welsh “w” is considered to be a vowel. As in\nScandinavian, the “y” in the second syllable is the same sound as the\nGerman letter _“ü”_ or the French \"_u\"_.\n\nTitles\n\nÉowyn's title was “LADY OF ROHAN” and was also known as “The White Lady\nof Rohan” due to her pale complexion. She also used the alias “DERNHELM”\nwhile riding with Rohan's army, and after her wounding by the Witch-king\nin the Pelennor Fields as “Lady of the Shield-arm”. After her\nmarriage to Faramir she was called the Lady of Ithilien (in contrast to\nFaramir, who was styled Prince of Ithilien), and LADY OF EMYN ARNEN.\n    \n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nIn Shakespeare's _Macbeth_, the title character believes he is\ninvincible because the three Witch Sisters have prophesied that “no man\nof woman born” will defeat him. Macduff, however, finds a loophole in\nthis prophecy by declaring that he was “from his mother's womb untimely\nripped” (which is usually interpreted to mean that he was delivered by\nCaesarean section).\n\nÉowyn and Merry, likewise, exploit a loophole in Glorfindel's prophecy,\nsince she was a woman and Merry was a hobbit. Similar to Shakespeare's\ncharacter Macbeth, the Witch-king was likely made overconfident by the\nprophecy, and unsettled by Éowyn's announcement that it did not apply to\nher.\n\n\nEarlier versions of the legendarium\n\nThe character Éowyn had at first been the daughter of King Théoden. In\nanother version, she had a cousin named Idis, the daughter of the king,\nwho was later removed in the manuscript as her role was eclipsed by\nÉowyn's.\n\nÉowyn was initially intended to marry Aragorn II. Tolkien considered\nthat Aragorn loved Éowyn after her death, when she avenged the death of\nKing Théoden. However, he later abandoned the concept, as he considered\nAragorn to be “too old and lordly and grim”.\n\nÉowyn was also once the twin-sister of Éomund.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film trilogy\n\n\n\nÉowyn does appear in the 1978 animated film _The Lord of the Rings_,\nwhich incorporates _The Fellowship of the Ring_ and the first half of\n_The Two Towers_ (ending with the charge of the Rohirrim out of Helm's\nDeep), but does not have any spoken lines.\n\nIn the 1980 animated film _The Return of the King_, Éowyn was voiced by\nNellie Bellflower. Because the film was produced in isolation (without\naccompanying versions of _The Fellowship of the Ring_ or _The Two\nTowers_), and hastily compresses the plot of the book, Éowyn does not\nappear in the film at all until the climactic moment on the Pelennor\nFields when she reveals her identity to the Witch-king and attacks him.\n\nIn Peter Jackson's film versions of _The Two Towers_ and _The Return of\nthe King_, Éowyn is portrayed by Australian actress Miranda Otto. The\nrole was originally offered to actress Alison Doody, but Doody had to\nwithdraw from the project due to pregnancy.\n\n\n\nThe theatrical version of _The Two Towers_ makes several changes and\nadditions to Éowyn's role:\n\n-   Wormtongue approaches her over Theodred's deathbed, trying to win\n    her affection, but she rebuffs him;\n-   Éowyn accompanies Theoden as he leads Edoras's people to Helm's\n    Deep; when the column was attacked by Warg-riders, she asks to\n    fight, but Theoden orders her to lead the people on to the fortress.\n    Along the way, she attempts to show her affection for Aragorn by\n    serving him lunch and he gives an amusing reaction to her bad\n    cooking.\n-   Éowyn watches over the women and children hiding in Aglarond while\n    the battle rages outside;\n-   Éowyn embraces Aragorn after the battle, thrilled to see him alive.\n\nSeveral additional scenes are added in the extended version:\n\n-   While Edoras is being evacuated, Aragorn notices the Riders trying\n    to restrain Brego, and Éowyn “introduces” them to each other.\n-   While Aragorn and the other men are preparing to defend Helm's Deep,\n    Éowyn protests that she has been assigned to wait in the caves\n    instead of being allowed to fight on the walls; when Aragorn tries\n    to comfort her, she blurts that the others who “love” him are being\n    allowed to fight at his side (this reproduces dialogue from _The\n    Return of the King_, when she is pleading with him to let her ride\n    with the Grey Company on the Paths of the Dead).\n-   In a short clip which appeared in the trailer, though not in either\n    version of the finished film, Éowyn has a sword ready when a stray\n    Uruk-hai enters the caves beneath Helm's Deep.\n\nIn the original theatrical release of _The Return of the King_, Éowyn's\ninjuries after fighting the Witch-king are less severe than in the\nnovel; her arm is broken but she maintains consciousness after the\nWitch-king dies, and next appears at Aragorn's coronation in Minas\nTirith, side by side with Faramir.\n\nSeveral additional scenes are added in the extended edition:\n\n-   On the night after the Battle of Helm's Deep, she wakes up on her\n    bed in Meduseld and tells Aragorn that she had a dream about the\n    fall of Numenor;\n-   At Dunharrow, after she rebukes Éomer for making fun of Merry's\n    desire to join in the fighting, he lectures her that war should be\n    left to men;\n-   Before the army reaches Minas Tirith, she tells Merry to have\n    courage, but Merry counsels her not to wish too much for death, as\n    she has so much to live for;\n-   After the toppling Mumak unhorses Éowyn and Merry, they both fight\n    on foot to defend Theoden from several attacking Orcs and Haradrim.\n    Éowyn personally duels Gothmog, and inflicts a crippling leg wound\n    on him.\n-   After the Witch-king dies, Éowyn crawls around looking for Merry,\n    but is spotted by an enraged Gothmog, who crawls after her but is\n    killed by Aragorn and Gimli before he can reach her;\n-   In the aftermath of the battle, Éomer finds her on the battlefield,\n    unconscious and apparently dead, and grieves, but she recovers in\n    the Houses of Healing and catches sight of Faramir for the first\n    time;\n-   As the Army of the West marches out of Minas Tirith, Éowyn and\n    Faramir watch them go, and he comforts her."

    "text": "EÄRNIL II was the thirty-second King of Gondor\n\n\nBiography\n\nEärnil II was selected to become king in TA 1945 after his predecessor,\nKing Ondoher and his heirs, was slain in battle. In the previous year a\ntwo-pronged attack had been launched upon Gondor by the Haradrim and the\nWainriders. In response, King Ondoher led the main army north to counter\nthe Easterling invasion at Dagorlad and was defeated. Eärnil was\ncommander of Gondor's southern army and guarded Pelargir. Eärnil led his\narmy to the Crossings of the Poros where he won an astounding victory\nover the Haradrim. This enabled him to turn his attention to the\ninvading Wainriders. The Wainriders, certain of victory, were\ncelebrating their success before they would enter Minas Anor. They were\nunaware of Eärnil's victory in the south and were taken by surprise when\nEärnil suddenly attacked them. As a result Eärnil won the Battle of the\nCamp.\n\nAfter the threat was eliminated Gondor's attention shifted towards\nSteward Pelendur and the Council of Gondor, for King Ondoher along with\nhis two sons were slain at Dagorlad. Both he and prince Arvedui of\nArthedain (successor state of Arnor) claimed the throne. Arvedui based\nhis claim on that he was the direct descendant of Isildur (second High\nKing of Arnor and Gondor and uncle to Meneldil first King of Gondor),\nand as the husband of Fíriel, only surviving child of King Ondoher. The\nclaim was rejected and Eärnil of the House of Anárion was elected king\nfor his deeds, heritage, and because the Steward, Pelendur, claimed that\n“The crown and royalty of Gondor belongs solely to the heirs of\nMeneldil, son of Anárion, to whom Isildur relinquished this realm. In\nGondor, this heritage is reckoned through the sons only; and we have not\nheard that the law is otherwise in Arnor”. He reigned as Eärnil II.\n\nAside from being a gifted general Eärnil also was a wise ruler. He sent\nmessages to Arvedui announcing that he received the crown of Gondor,\naccording to the laws and the needs of the South-Kingdom, “but I do not\nforget the royalty of Arnor, nor deny our kinship, nor wish that the\nrealms of Elendil be estranged. I will send to your aid when you have\nneed, so far as I am able.” And at last in the autumn of 1973 Third Age,\nmessages came to Gondor that Arthedain was in great trouble, and that\nthe Witch-king of Angmar was preparing a final stroke against it. Then\nEärnil sent his son Eärnur north with a fleet, as swiftly as he could,\nand with as great a strength as he could spare to aid Arvedui (now\nking). Eärnur arrived too late to save Arthedain and Arvedui who had\nfled north (and was drowned in the Ice-Bay of Forochel) but managed to\ndefeat the Witch-kingdom of Angmar in the Battle of Fornost with the\nhelp of Círdan, the Lord of the Grey Havens and Glorfindel with an army\nfrom Rivendell. There, Eärnur earned the hatred of the Witch-king.\n\nHowever, Eärnil was not able to withstand the takeover of Minas Ithil by\nthe Ringwraiths. Minas Anor was renamed Minas Tirith (Tower of Guard)\nand Minas Ithil was called Minas Morgul (Tower of Sorcery).\n\nEärnil died in TA 2043 after a rule of ninety-eight years and was\nsucceeded by his son Eärnur, who was as good a general as his father but\nlacked his wisdom, and who would be the last king before Aragorn\nreclaimed his throne after a long gap."

He was a great warrior and became a\ngreat leader of armies before he became King. His greatest victory was\nagainst Angmar in TA 1975 in the Battle of Fornost, in which he defeated\nthe Witch-king, whom he intended to slay had his steed not panicked in\nterror of the Witch-king's darkness. It was to him that Glorfindel\nstated his prophecy that “''not by the hand of men shall he fall”\n''referring to the Witch-king as he fled from defeat. After becoming\nKing in TA 2043, he was challenged by the Witch-king of Angmar, chief of\nthe Ringwraiths, who then resided in Minas Morgul. Eärnur, being quick\nto anger and wrath, would have accepted his challenge had the wise\nSteward Mardil Voronwë not held him back, and so the first challenge\nwent unanswered. In TA 2050 a second challenge came, mocking Eärnur, and\nMardil was not able to stop Eärnur from accepting the challenge. After\nentering the gates of Minas Morgul with a small escort, Eärnur was never\nheard from again. His crown lay on his father's tomb in the Hallows of\nMinas Tirith.\n\nThe Line of Anárion was broken with the disappearance of Eärnur, and the\nrule of Gondor passed to the Stewards beginning with Mardil Voronwë, the\nSteward who had tried to restrain Eärnur from going to Minas Morgul to\nface the Witch-king. The Stewards were to rule “until the King returns”\nfor it wasn't sure at first whether Eärnur had been killed dueling with\nthe Witch-king or not. In addition, Eärnur left without naming an heir,\nand while many nobles in Gondor could lay some sort of claim to the\nkingship, those claims were generally held in doubt, and no one wanted\nto risk another civil war like the one that had devastated and weakened\nGondor.\n\n\nPersonality\n\nEärnur did not inherit his father's wisdom; his only delight was battle\nand he desired no wife. He was also known for engaging in weapons sports\nand was more of a champion than a king of men.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_EÄRNUR_ was a Quenyan word that meant “Sea-friend”.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\n\n\nVideo games\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings Online_, it is revealed that the Witch-king\ncorrupted Eärnur into a Wraith soon after he entered Minas Morgul. Now\nknown as Mordirith, he became known as the False King, Steward of\nAngmar. In a twisted mockery of the Stewards who replaced him, Mordirith\nruled in Carn Dûm on the behalf of the Witch-king, suppressing any form\nof rebellion from the few Men that had not allied with Angmar. He was\nkilled during the War of the Ring by the Elf Maiden Narmeleth, who\nfelled him with the sword Dunachar. He was thrown into the void of\nAngmar after his death. Narmeleth was mortally wounded in this battle\nand died a few minutes later.\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of\nthe Witch-king he is a playable character in the epilogue in which he\nalongside Glorfindel and Elrond set out to destroy Angmar after it's\nbloody victory over Arnor. His role in the game is mostly the same as in\nthe books."

A great smith and friend of the Dwarves of\nNogrod and Belegost, Eöl devised Galvorn, a black metal of great\nstrength and malleability, which he fashioned into armour that he wore\nwhen he went abroad. He forged two great black swords from a meteorite's\nmetal, but had to give the sword Anglachel to Thingol as tribute for\nliving in Nan Elmoth. The other sword, Anguirel, he kept for himself.\n\n\nBiography\n\nBirth\n\nDuring the Years of the Trees, Eöl was born to a lineage of Avari and\nSindar Elves. He became an Elf of amazing skills in blacksmith and\nforged a black, shining metal called Galvorn. Out of the many swords he\nhad forged, Anguirel was one of the black swords he kept for himself,\nwhile the other great sword, Anglachel, was given to Thingol, the High\nKing of the Sindar during the First Age.\n\nEöl forged a suit of armor out of Galvorn to which he wore and kept. He\nlived in Nan Elmoth, a forest in Beleriand to which he appointed himself\nLord and built a home there. He forged poisoned javelins and stayed\nisolated in his land for many years until the arrival of Aredhel.\n\nAredhel and Marriage\n\n\n\nAredhel Ar-Feiniel, the sister of King Turgon had left the gated and\nhidden City of Gondolin to seek freedom and find distant family and\nfriends. Her travels lead through Beleriand, and to the dark woods of\nNan Elmoth, where she met Eöl, who noticed her beauty from afar. He then\nset enchantments with his Elven magic about her so that she could not\nescape the forest and found her way only to his halls. After marrying\nhim, she stayed with him many years and bore him a son, Maeglin.\n\nLater Life and Death\n\nAs the First Age progressed, Eöl developed a great hatred for the\nÑoldor and therefore refused Aredhel and Maeglin permission to seek out\ntheir kin. While Eöl was away at a feast in Nogrod, Aredhel and Maeglin\nleft for Gondolin, stealing Anguirel from him, and Eöl followed them.\nWhen denied permission to leave with Maeglin, he grew furious and tried\nto kill his son with one of his javelins. Aredhel got in the way and it\ninstead hit her; she died from poisoning.\n\nThe King and his people were unwilling to forgive this deed and Eöl was\nsentenced to death and cast over the Caragdûr, cursing Maeglin on his\nway down the cliff to his doom. It was a greatly unjust killing that\nbrought Maeglin misfortune in his later years. \n\n\nOther forms of the legendarium\n\nIn the essay _ and Eldar”_, published in _The War of\nthe Jewels_, Eöl was an Avar who descended from the same clan of the\nelves the Ñoldor had come from (the Tatyar), although Eöl hated his\nValinorean cousins. Eöl's love for smithying and friendliness to the\nDwarves is consistent with Tolkien's view of the Ñoldor, which are\ndescribed as Dwarf-friends in the First and Second Ages. However, in a\nlater writing, entitled _Maeglin_ and published in the same\nvolume, Tolkien said he was of the kin of Thingol.

    "name": "Faramir",
    "lotrUrl": "https://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Faramir",
    "race": "Human",
    "text": "FARAMIR was the second son of Denethor II and the younger brother of\nBoromir. He was the Captain of the Rangers of Ithilien and Captain of\nthe White Tower upon his brother's death.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, Faramir became the first Prince of Ithilien\nand married Éowyn of Rohan.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\n\n\nFaramir was born in the year TA 2983 to Denethor II and Finduilas,\ndaughter of Adrahil of Dol Amroth. The following year, his\ngrandfather Ecthelion II died and his father, Denethor, succeeded him as\nthe Ruling Steward of Gondor.\n\nWhen Faramir was five years old, Finduilas died. Her death caused\nDenethor to become detached from his family. The relationship between\nFaramir and Boromir, who was five years elder of the brothers, grew much\ncloser and greater in love. Despite the obvious way that Denethor\nfavored Boromir over Faramir, there was no jealousy or rivalry between\nthem. Boromir protected and helped him, and Faramir looked up to his\nolder brother. Although the siblings were very similar in appearance\nwith their dark hair and grey eyes, it was not so in personality.\nBoromir was defined to be the more daring one, as well as the more\nfearless and strong warrior. Faramir’s boldness was incorrectly judged\nless due to his gentle nature and love of lore and music.\n\nIt was this interest that formed a friendship between Faramir and\nGandalf the Grey. The youngest son of Denethor learned of what he could\nfrom Gandalf’s wisdom and mentoring. Denethor did not approve of Faramir\nas the “Wizard's pupil”, for he neither trusted nor liked the Istar.\n\nFaramir's leadership, skill-in-arms, and swift but hardy judgment proved\nto be handy on the battlefield. During the War of the Ring, he was the\nCaptain of the Rangers of Ithilien, who often skirmished with the allies\nof Sauron in that province. Faramir valiantly defended Gondor from the\nEnemy, but did not enjoy fighting for war’s sake.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nIn June of 3018, Sauron's forces attacked Osgiliath, under the command\nof the Witch-king, whose presence caused the soldiers to draw back\nacross the Anduin. When the last bridge was destroyed, in which\nBoromir’s and Faramir's companies remained, the two brothers, along with\ntwo others, swam to shore and managed to hold all of the west shores of\nthe Anduin.\n\nThe night before the assault, Faramir had a prophetic dream of a voice\nspeaking the following riddle:\n\n ‟Seek for the Sword that was broken: In Imladris it dwells; There shall\nbe counsels taken Stronger than Morgul-spells. There shall be shown a\ntoken That Doom is near at hand, For Isildur's Bane shall waken, And the\nHalfling forth shall stand”\n\n    —Faramir's dream\n\nIt came to Faramir twice more and once to his brother, and the brothers\ntold of their dream to Denethor, who only told them that Imladris was an\nElvish name for Rivendell, home of Elrond the Half-elven. Although\nFaramir had wanted to go for Gondor’s sake and was originally chosen by\nthe Council of Elders in Gondor, Boromir, with the urging of his father,\nstepped forward and claimed the right to the errand, deeming it to be\ndangerous and doubtful. The Gondorian traveled nearly four months to\nRivendell, losing his horse in the process, and arriving just before the\nCouncil of Elrond.\n\nOn February 29, 3019 at midnight, Faramir, who was on guard duty on the\nwestern shore in Osgiliath, waded down to a boat floating down the\nAnduin River. To his grief, it contained the dead body of his brother,\nwhich was pierced with many wounds. In it lay his sword, broken, but\nthere was no sign of the Great Horn, which he and his father had heard\nbeing blown far across the distance in the North three days prior.\n\n\n\nDuring a battle with Southrons, Faramir, who took over his brother's\nposition as the Captain of the White Tower, encountered the Hobbits\nFrodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, recognizing them to be the Halflings\nhis dream spoke of. After the skirmish, Faramir took the pair to Henneth\nAnnûn and questioned them further.\n\nThrough intelligent questioning and intuition, Faramir determined that\nFrodo was carrying some great evil weapon of the Dark Lord of the Enemy.\nAt this point, he showed the crucial difference between him and his\nproud brother:\n\nSam accidentally revealed Boromir's desire for the Enemy’s Ring,\nIsildur's Bane. Despite the hobbits’ fears, Faramir remained true to his\nvow that he would not take it even if it lay on the highway, for he was\nwise enough to realize that such a weapon could not be used for good.\nWith this knowledge, he also realized the peril his brother had\nfaced.\n\nOn the very same night, Gollum was spotted fishing in the Forbidden Pool\nnext to Henneth Annûn -- an act punishable by death. Faramir listened to\nFrodo’s pleads to spare Gollum’s life though, and after interrogating\nthe creature he deemed that Frodo and Sam would be free in the Lands of\nGondor and Gollum under Frodo's protection. Giving them provisions, he\nsent them on their way to continue their quest. At their parting,\nFaramir warned Frodo of Gollum's treacherous nature and that the path\nGollum had proposed (Cirith Ungol) had an evil reputation of old.\n\n\n\nFaramir and his company retreated to Cair Andros, an island in the River\nAnduin that guarded the northern approaches to Minas Tirith. After\nnoting that the sky was now covered in complete darkness, Faramir sent\nhis company south to reinforce the garrison at Osgiliath while he and\nthree others of his men rode to Minas Tirith directly. Along the way,\nthey were pursued by the Nazgûl, riding fell beasts. The men, except\nFaramir, were unhorsed and it was the Captain, a master of both beasts\nand men, who was still horsed and rode back to aid the fallen.\nIf Gandalf had not intervened, they would have surely perished.\n\n\n\nArriving at Minas Tirith, Faramir reported to Denethor and Gandalf of\nhis encounter with Frodo and Sam. Denethor became angry that Faramir had\nnot brought the ring to Gondor, wishing that he and his brother’s places\nwere reversed, since Denethor believed that Boromir would bring the\nEnemy’s weapon to him.\n\nDenethor sent his remaining son to hold Western Osgiliath against the\nhosts of the Enemy that outnumbered their own greatly. Although Faramir\ndisagreed with his father’s strategy, he agreed to go.\n\nThe Witch-king overwhelmed the men of Gondor and won Osgiliath. Faramir\ndrew back to the Causeway Forts, in which many of the men were wounded\nor killed. Faramir decided to stay with the rearguard in order to make\nsure that the retreat over Pelennor Fields would not turn into a\ndisaster.\n\nFaramir was gravely wounded by a poisonous arrow during the retreat.\nFortunately, Gandalf and Faramir’s uncle, Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth,\nrode to the aid of Faramir and the troops with hosts of cavalry. Imrahil\nbore Faramir back to Denethor, telling him that his son had done great\ndeeds.\n\nRegretting that he had thanklessly sent his son off in needless peril\nwithout his blessing, Denethor, after looking in the Palantir, believing\nthat the Ring was captured and the end was near, ordered his servants to\nbuild a funeral pyre for him and his son, who was believed to be\npoisoned by the Witch-king’s dart. Despite the protests of the Hobbit,\nPippin Took (serving the steward in payment of Boromir's death) that\nFaramir was still alive, Denethor continued with this madness and\nreleased him from his service.\n\nHorrified, Pippin went to alert Gandalf and Beregond, one of the Tower\nGuards. Beregond, who loved his captain enough to abandon his post and\nrisk his life protecting him, stopped the servants from lighting the\npyre. Pippin returned with Gandalf, who intervened by taking Faramir off\nthe pyre as Faramir moaned out to his father in his dreams. Denethor\ntook out a knife, trying to take Faramir back, but Beregond placed\nhimself in front of Faramir. Seeing that he could not win, Denethor lit\nthe pyre and laid himself down upon it, burning himself alive.\n\n\n\nThen, Faramir was laid in the Houses of Healing until Aragorn came and\nrevived Faramir with _athelas_. It was not a poisoned dart of the\nWitch-king that wounded him in a state near death as it was with\nSnowmane, but the arrow of a Haradrim, along with Faramir’s weariness\nand grief concerning his constantly strained relationship with his\nfather and the Black Breath of the Nazgul, who, under Sauron's orders,\nhunted Faramir ever since he had left Ithilien. When he awoke, Faramir\nimmediately recognized Aragorn as his rightful King, therefore realizing\nthat no proof was needed after all.\n\nBefore Aragorn left to lead the soldiers to the Black gate, he commanded\nthe Warden of the Houses of Healing to have Faramir and Éowyn to remain\nresting for at least ten days. After Éowyn demanded that the Warden take\nher to the Steward of the City to have her released so she could ride\nout in battle, Faramir, whose heart was moved with pity and pierced by\nher beauty, told Éowyn that he too, had to heed the advice of the\nWarden. He fulfilled her request to have her room look east to Mordor\nand asked her to talk with him at times.\n\nFaramir and Éowyn walked together in the gardens nearly every day, and\nhe learned from Merry Brandybuck of Éowyn's despair of feeling trapped,\nwaiting on the waning of Théoden, and Aragorn's rejection of Éowyn's\nlove.\n\nOn March 25, Faramir gave Éowyn a dark blue mantle sewn with silver\nstars that had once belonged to his mother, as they stood at the wall\nthat looked towards Mordor. There, they saw a threatening darkness\ntowering over and seeing this, Faramir told her of his dream of the\nDownfall of Númenor that the darkness threatening to overtake\nMiddle-earth reminded him of the great wave that swallowed the land of\nNúmenor. Somehow, to Faramir and the people of the city, a hope and joy\nwelled in their hearts and he kissed Éowyn’s brow.\n\n\n\nÉowyn, however, still felt languished and unfulfilled. Several days\nafter he’d given her the mantle, Faramir told her that he understood\nthat she desired to be lifted in greatness and out of the cage she had\nfelt trapped in, and when Aragorn only gave her understanding and pity,\ninstead of love (which she later realized was a shadow of love), she had\nwanted to die valiantly and gloriously in battle. He told her that\nthough he had first pitied her, he now loved her. There, Éowyn’s grief\nwas fully healed, and no longer did she desire glory or greatness and\nrealized that she had come to love Faramir in return.\n\nLater Years\n\nFaramir briefly served as the Ruling Steward of Gondor, and began\npreparing the city for the King's arrival. On the day of the King’s\nofficial coronation on May 1st, Faramir surrendered his office, which\nwas represented by the white rod of the Steward, kneeling as he did so.\nAragorn however, gave the rod back, announcing that as long as his line\nwould last, Faramir and his descendants would be Stewards of Gondor.\nAfter Faramir had asked the people of Gondor if they accepted Aragorn as\ntheir King (which they did), Faramir took the crown out and Aragorn was\ncrowned King Elessar.\n\nKing Elessar appointed Faramir as the Prince of Ithilien, and Beregond\nto be the Captain of his guard, the White Company. As Prince of\nIthilien, he and the Prince of Dol Amroth, Gondor's two highest-ranking\nnobles, became King Elessar's chief commanders. His duties also included\nacting as resident march-warden of Gondor's main eastward outpost,\nrehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws\nand orcs and cleansing Minas Morgul of evil-remnants. Faramir also\nfulfilled the traditional role as Steward, acting as the King’s chief\ncounselor as well as ruling Gondor in the King's absence.\n\n\n\nAfter marrying Éowyn, the two settled in Emyn Arnen, where they had\nat least one son (named Elboron), who succeeded him as Steward of\nGondor, Prince of Ithilien, and Lord of Emyn Arnen, after Faramir's\ndeath in FO 82. Faramir lived to be 120 years old, due to the large\npercentage of pure Dúnedain ancestry he possessed as a member of the\nGondorian nobility. One of his descendants was Barahir, who may have\nbeen the son of Elboron.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nAs with the other names of the Kings of Gondor and their heirs, it\nis possible that the name Faramir could be Quenya.\n\n\nQuotes\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nAccording to Tolkien, Faramir was “modest, fair-minded and scrupulously\njust, and very merciful”. He mentioned once that he did not invent\nFaramir, though he liked the character very much. As a soldier in\nWorld War I, Tolkien connected himself with Faramir, who only loved\nswords for “which they defend”. Among the characters, Tolkien wrote,\n\"“As far as any character is 'like me', it is Faramir”.\n\nIt is for this reason that Tolkien bestowed his dream of a great wave\n(that reoccurred in his family) to Faramir. In one of his letters, he\nwrote, “For when Faramir speaks of his private vision of the Great Wave,\nhe speaks for me. That vision and dream has been ever with me—and has\nbeen inherited (as I only discovered recently) by one of my children,\nMichael”.\n\n\nAppearances in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Two Towers_ (First appearance)\n-   _The Return of the King_\n\nIn the films\n\n-   _The Lord of the RingsThe Two Towers_\n-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nPeter Jackson's film trilogy\n\n\n\nDavid Wenham portrays Faramir in Peter Jackson's film trilogy, appearing\nin _The Two Towers_ and _The Return of the King_. His depiction in the\nfilms differs significantly from his appearance in the novels.\n\nIn _The Two Towers_, Faramir captures Frodo and Sam in Ithilien and\nholds them prisoner. After capturing and interrogating Gollum, Faramir\ndiscovers how Boromir died and that Frodo carries the One Ring. Wishing\nto impress his father Denethor, Faramir plans to take Frodo and the One\nRing to Minas Tirith. It is only in Osgiliath, where he realizes the\ngreat evil of the Ring, that he lets Frodo, Sam and Gollum go. A\nflashback from the extended edition elaborates on Faramir's complex\nrelationship with his father and brother.\n\nIn _The Return of the King_, Faramir is still in command of Osgiliath\nwhen it is overrun by Mordor's armies. After Faramir retreats to Minas\nTirith, an enraged Denethor orders him to lead a suicide mission to\nrecapture Osgiliath; Denethor also reveals that he wishes that Faramir\nhad died instead of Boromir. Plagued by guilt, Faramir takes on the\nmission but is grievously injured.\n\nAfter Faramir is dragged back to Minas Tirith unconscious, a deranged\nDenethor plans to burn himself and his younger son alive. Only Gandalf\nand Pippin's intervention saves Faramir's life. He recovers from his\ninjuries and is present at Aragorn's coronation alongside Éowyn.\n\nIn the extended edition, it is revealed that he falls in love with Éowyn\nin the Houses of Healing while they are both recovering from their\ninjuries.\n\nCriticism of film appearance\n\nMany fans of the book criticize the changes Jackson made to Faramir's\ncharacter, claiming that it seriously damages his persona; some have\njokingly dubbed this interpretation “Filmamir” or “Farfromthebookamir”,\namong other names .\n\nJackson's explanation is that he needed another adventure to delay Frodo\nand Sam, because the episode at Cirith Ungol was moved to the third\nmovie, and so a new climax was needed. Another explanation often cited\nis that it was felt that for dramatic reasons it was necessary to show\ncharacter _development_, which meant that Faramir had to go through some\nkind of struggle or difficult decision. Jackson also argued that it was\nnecessary for Faramir to be tempted by the Ring because everyone else\nwas tempted, and letting Faramir be immune would be inconsistent, at\nleast in the eyes of a film audience, and would weaken the films'\nportrayal of the Ring, which was that of a seduction of normal men.\n\nA number of fans however, remain unimpressed and unconvinced by\nJackson's explanations, and have complained that Faramir was changed\ninto a carbon copy of Boromir and have commented that Tolkien himself,\nwho once likened himself to Faramir, would not have liked the way the\nfilm characterized him. Jackson counters that the important difference\nbetween Boromir and Faramir is retained: Boromir was completely\nincapable of resisting the temptation of the Ring. Faramir, realizing\nwhat his brother went through, what Frodo and Gollum must endure, and\nhis own morals and personality in check, realizes the danger, and freely\ndecides to let Frodo go.\n\n\n\nCriticism was also leveled at the Rangers' treatment of Gollum. Fans\nbitterly pointed out that Faramir, whose gentle heart was easily moved\nby pity, would have never let his men treat a prisoner (no matter how\nevil) in any way but with kindness. In the book, Faramir calls the\ncreature Sméagol instead of Gollum, and told his men to “treat him\ngently...but watch him” (The Two Towers, “The Window on the West”).\n\nIn the extended edition of _The Two Towers_, Jackson has included a new\nflashback scene showing that Denethor has been neglecting him and\nfavoring Boromir, so that Faramir wanted to please his father by\nbringing him the Ring. (The relationship is similarly strained in the\nbooks, but there his father's favoritism does not seem to affect his\ndecisions in Ithilien.) Overall, however, new Extended Edition scenes\nwith Faramir brought the character closer to the sympathetic treatment\nof the books (the line he is given regarding a fallen Southron belongs\nto Sam in the books, but is not out of keeping with Faramir's\ncharacter).\n\nFurthermore, instead of numerous captains and commanders taking charge\nof Gondor's defense, it is heavily implied throughout the films that\nwhen Boromir leaves all responsibility lies on Faramir to take command\nand defend Gondor, he does this to the best of his ability leading\nGondorian forces through a prolonged battle that lasts from Midnight to\nthe afternoon following, despite having legions of orcs pouring over the\nAnduin, thankfully his ability to lead a prolonged retreat that lasted\nthe whole night, gave time for Gandalf the white to take over command of\nMinas Tirith and lead the oncoming siege.\n\nFaramir is played by David Wenham in the films, who joked that he got\nthe role because he and Sean Bean, who played Boromir, both had large\nnoses. A minor change is that in the book, Faramir and his brother are\ndark-haired and lack beards, but in the movie, they have fair hair and\nare slightly bearded.\n\nThe Battle for Middle-earth II\n\nIn the RTS game _The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II_,\nthe hero Faramir is voiced by Paul Mercier."

Uniquely among the\nÑoldor, he and his descendants all had golden hair inherited from his\nVanyarin mother Indis, thus his house was sometimes called “_The Golden\nHouse of Finarfin_”.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nFinarfin was the youngest child and third son of Finwë, High-King of the\nNoldor in Aman, with his second wife Indis of the Vanyar. His elder\nsiblings were _Findis_, Fingolfin, and ''Írimë ''while his elder\nhalf-brother was the infamous Noldorin High-prince Fëanor who was the\neldest son of Finarfin's father Finwë, In YT 1280, Finarfin married\nEärwen, a princess of the Teleri being the daughter of Olwë, King of the\nTeleri, which made him thus related to the kin of Thingol (Elwë), King\nof Doriath who was the brother of Olwë. Together, they had four (five)\nchildren: Finrod Felagund, Orodreth (according to the published\n_Silmarillion_) Angrod, Aegnor, and an only daughter Galadriel who was\nthe youngest child.\n\nAfter the death of Finwë, when Fëanor gave his wrathful speech before\nthe Ñoldor of Tirion, Finarfin was there, and listening to the hasty\nwords, he tried in vain to persuade the Ñoldor to pause and not to be\nrash. Nevertheless he departed with his brothers Fëanor and Fingolfin\nfor Middle-earth, but turned back when Mandos pronounced the Doom of the\nÑoldor. Finarfin and his people were pardoned by the Valar, and then\nhe became King of the residual Ñoldor in Aman and presumably still rules\nfrom Tirion on Túna.\n\nDuring the War of Wrath, Finarfin led a large battalion of the Valar,\ncomprised of Ñoldorin, Vanyarin, and Telerin Elves.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis father-name is ARAFINWË, the “Noble-Finwë”, from the Quenya _ara_\n(“noble, high, royal”). His amilessë (mother-name) is\nINGOLDO (“the Ñoldo”).\n\nOther names\n\nAn Old English translation for his name was FINRED FELANOP, in which\n“Felanop” means “very bold”.\n\n\nDescendants\n\nThrough Galadriel, he is the grandfather of Lady Celebrian of Rivendell\n(wife of Elrond), and consequently, the great-grandfather of her three\nchildren Elladan and Elrohir, and Arwen Undómiel, future Queen of\nGondor.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn the early versions of the legendarium, Finarfin was referred as\n“Finrod” his son Finrod Felagund was “Inglor Felagund”. As such, he\nappears in the first edition of _The Lord of the Rings_ as Finrod. This\nwas changed in later editions, but not all references to Inglor were\nremoved. (See Gildor Inglorion)\n\nThere was an error to a character's name, wherein J.R.R. Tolkien changed\nIngwiel son of Ingwe to Finarfin son of Finwe.\n\n\nNotes\n\n1.  Orodreth appears as one of Finarfin's sons in the published\n    _Silmarillion_. In Tolkien's writings however he clearly is Angrod's\n    son, but this was changed in the _Silmarillion_ by Christopher\n    Tolkien, which he later admitted was a mistake."

Her date of birth and birthplace are unknown.\nShe was betrothed to Gwindor, who named her FAELIVRIN.\n\nIn 472 of the First Age , Gwindor was captured during the Nírnaeth\nArnoediad by Morgoth, and when he returned in FA 490 he came with a\ncompanion who called himself _Agarwaen son of Umarth_ (the Bloodstained,\nson of Ill-Fate). Unbeknownst to Finduilas, this was actually Túrin, son\nof Húrin. Despite her old feelings for Gwindor, Finduilas fell in love\nwith Túrin, but Túrin refused her in respect for his friend. Gwindor\nrealized this, and revealed Túrin's name to Finduilas and tried to let\nTúrin fall in love with Finduilas, since he realized Finduilas loved\nTúrin instead of him.\n\nAfter the failure of the Battle of Tumhalad, Glaurung and an army of\nOrcs sacked Nargothrond. Gwindor was slain and when Túrin returned to\nNargothrond he was caught in a trance by the dragon who spoke to him of\nhis kin in Hithlum, rendering him deaf to the cries of Finduilas as a\nparty of Orcs dragged her past him as a captive intended for Angband.\n\nGlaurung's deceit caused Túrin to abandon Finduilas and instead go to\nHithlum in search of his kin. By the time he finally went to search for\nFinduilas she was dead, for she had been killed when the Orcs guarding\nher were waylaid by the Haladin of Brethil at the Crossings of Taeglin.\nBefore their defeat the Orcs had killed all their captives, nailing\nFinduilas to a tree with a spear. The people of Haladin buried her in a\nmound they called _Haudh-en-Elleth_, Mound of the Elf Maiden.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_FINDUILAS_ comes from the Sindarin elements _fin_ (“hair”), a common\nprefix in the House of Finwë , _duil,_ which may have come from the\n_ethuil_ (“spring”), and _las_ (“leaf”).\n\nHer epessë ''FAELIVRIN ''means “Gleam of the Sun on the Pools of Ivrin”\nfrom the Sindarin FAEL (“gleam, brilliance”).\n\nBeing the child of Orodreth, Finduilas had both the blood of the Ñoldor\nand the Falmari, the Teleri of Aman, and belonged to both the House of\nFinarfin and the House of Olwë.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn _The Silmarillion_, her father Orodreth was the son of Finarfin, thus\nmaking Finduilas Finarfin's granddaughter, instead of his\ngreat-granddaughter in later writings.

    "text": "FINGOLFIN was the second High King of the Ñoldor in Beleriand; the\nÑoldor being one of the three branches of Elves. He was the eldest son\nof Finwë and Indis, younger brother of Findis, older brother of Irimë\nand Finarfin, and the younger half-brother of Fëanor. He founded the\nHouse of Fingolfin, which ruled the Ñoldor in Middle-earth. His wife was\nAnairë and his children were Fingon, Turgon, Aredhel, and Argon.\nFingolfin was said to be the strongest, most steadfast, and most valiant\nof Finwë's sons.\n\nHe had a steed named Rochallor.\n\n\nBiography\n\nLife in Valinor\n\n\n\nFingolfin was born in Tirion in Valinor during the Noontide of Valinor.\nNeither he nor his brothers were particularly close to Fëanor, as he was\nrather scornful of them. Nonetheless, he lived in peace with his kin for\nmany centuries. However, the peace of Valinor was brought to an end when\nMelkor, the most powerful of the Valar and the source of evil in Arda,\nwas released from imprisonment. Feigning repentance and rehabilitation,\nMelkor's malice had in fact only festered and grown worse while\nimprisoned, and he sought to bring ruin upon the Elves for, as he saw\nit, causing his downfall. Of the three clans of Elves in Aman, only the\nÑoldor welcomed him, as his knowledge was the greatest of any of the\nValar. Gaining their confidence, Melkor was slowly able to spread lies\nand half-truths amongst them regarding the intentions of the Valar. Over\ntime, these lies bore fruit and the Ñoldor began to openly debate\nremaining in Aman, and chief among the disgruntled Elves was Fëanor. One\nof the lies was that the sons of Indis, of which Fingolfin was the\neldest, were trying to usurp Fëanor as the rightful heir of Finwë and\nseize the Silmarils, three magnificently beautiful gems that Fëanor had\ncreated, for themselves.\n\nFëanor, already not fond of his half-siblings, had little trouble\nbelieving the rumor. Fëanor hastened to Tirion and confronted Fingolfin,\ndrawing his sword and threatening him with violence. When it became\nknown what Fëanor had done to Fingolfin, he was called by the Valar to\nexplain himself, and Melkor's lies were found out. However, Fëanor was\nheld accountable for threatening Fingolfin and was banished to the\nfortress of Formenos in the north. Around twelve years later, the two\nbrothers reconciled at a festival in Valinor (though Fëanor did so only\ngrudgingly). However, during this festival, Melkor and the monstrous\nspider Ungoliant attacked, killing the Two Trees of Valinor and\ndarkening all of Aman. They then assaulted the fortress of Formenos,\nwhere Melkor slew Finwë and stole Fëanor's Silmarils. In his pride,\ngrief, anger, and selfishness, Fëanor sought revenge upon Melkor (now\nnamed Morgoth), and attempted to convince the rest of the Ñoldor to\nassist him by convincing them that journeying to Middle-earth would\nbring them glories and treasures untold. However, many were either not\nconvinced or only half convinced, and deferred to Fingolfin, who was\nmore trusted than his brother. Fingolfin, though not particularly keen\nto leave Valinor, had sworn to Fëanor to uphold his place as the elder\nbrother, and did not want to abandon his people to the decisions of his\nrash and selfish brother. He decided to accompany Fëanor.\n\nLife in Middle-earth\n\n\n\nAs such, Fingolfin ended up becoming the leader of the second and\nlargest of the three Ñoldor hosts to leave Tirion for Middle-earth.\nFëanor led the first, and Fingolfin's brother Finarfin led the third,\nsmallest, and most reluctant host. Most of those who journeyed with him\nwere somewhat reluctant to leave, and so it took a longer time for them\nto start their journey than the host directly following Fëanor.\nUnfortunately, this delay caused Fingolfin to make a grievous mistake,\nfor not long after setting out, Fëanor attempted to seize the fleet of\nthe seafaring Teleri Elves in order to get to Middle-earth more quickly\nand safely. The Teleri resisted fiercely, and Fingolfin's host caught up\nwith Fëanor's during the middle of a heated battle. Seeing this,\nFingolfin mistakenly assumed that the Teleri had attempted to waylay the\nÑoldor, perhaps even at the request of the Valar. He and his host joined\nthe battle against the Teleri, and completed the first Elven kinslaying.\nAfter the slaughter and the theft of the ships, the Ñoldor encountered a\nfigure, possibly Mandos himself, who proclaimed a terrible Doom upon\nthem for the Kinslaying. Hearing this, and having not participated at\nall in the slaughter of the Teleri, Finarfin's host turned back and\nreturned to Tirion. The rest of the Ñoldor continued north, but as the\njourney grew more and more dangerous, many of the Ñoldor, upset about\nthe Kinslaying and having been reluctant in the first place, began to\nopenly curse Fëanor. In response, he and those most loyal to him\ndeparted one night on the Teleri ships. Upon reaching Middle-earth,\nFëanor burned the ships. The fires were spotted by Fingolfin's host, and\nthey knew that they were betrayed. Fingolfin's host's only route to\nMiddle-earth was now to cross the phenomenally dangerous ices of the\nHelcaraxë or to return to Tirion in disgrace and suffer the punishment\nof the Valar for their role in the Kinslaying. But Fingolfin wished to\ncontinue to Middle-earth, in no small part to confront the brother for\nhis utter betrayal. Fingolfin's host chose to cross the Helcaraxë, but\nlost many of its members along the way, greatly increasing the wrath and\nbitterness that Fingolfin and his host felt for Fëanor's host. The host\nof Fingolfin finally arrived in Middle-earth at the rising of the Sun\n(FA 1) and was assailed by an Orc army in Lammoth resulting in the death\nof Fingolfin's youngest child. Destroying the Orc host, Fingolfin and\nhis army approached the doors of Angband, Morgoth's great fortress and\nsmote upon them, but Morgoth and his servants, dismayed by the light of\nthe new Sun, stayed hidden inside. Fingolfin and the Ñoldor then came to\nthe northern shores of Lake Mithrim (FA 2), from which the Fëanorian\npart of the host had withdrawn.\n\nWith virtually all of Fingolfin's host furious over Fëanor's betrayal, a\ncivil war would have broken out amongst the Ñoldor had it not been for\nthe actions of Fingolfin's son Fingon. After the initial confrontation\nof Fëanor's host against Morgoth's forces, the Elves had defeated their\nfoes with relative ease, but Fëanor in his pride and wrath had thought\nto come upon Morgoth himself, and had pursued the remnants of Morgoth's\narmy with only a small vanguard. Upon reaching Angband, this vanguard\nencountered a few Balrogs and had quickly been slain, with Fëanor\nfalling at the hands of Gothmog, Lord of the Balrogs. After this,\nMorgoth had sent a false claim of parley to the new leader of Fëanor's\nhost; his eldest son Maedhros. Expecting treachery, both sides sent\ngreater force than agreed upon to the negotiation site, but Morgoth's\nhad been accompanied by Balrogs, who slew the Elven company in short\norder and captured Maedhros. After failing to gain concessions from the\nElves by offering to release Maedhros, Morgoth chained Maedrhos to a\ncliff by one hand and left him there. Fingon quickly learned of this\nand, having been a great friend of Maedhros before Fëanor's divisive\nactions, he sought to rescue his friend. Succeeding, both returned to\nthe gathered Ñoldor, who were amazed at Fingon's actions. Seeking to\nkeep his people united, Maedhros waived all claim to kingship, and\nFingolfin thus became High King of the Ñoldor (FA 7). They were quickly\nable to establish mighty kingdoms in Beleriand, and subsequent attacks\nby Morgoth against them were repelled completely and with relative ease.\nFingolfin established the Siege of Angband after the complete victory of\nDagor Aglareb, and ruled in peace and prosperity from Hithlum, by the\nnorthern shores of Lake Mithrim. On FA 20, he hosted the famous feast of\nMereth Aderthad in Eithel Ivrin, which was attended by emissaries from\nall the Elves in Beleriand. There Fingolfin retained close counsel\nand friendship with Maedhros. \n\nCombat with Morgoth and death\n\nThough the Elves were able to contain Morgoth's Orcs, they did not\npossess the strength to attack Angband directly or actually overthrow\nMorgoth. Morgoth himself was not idle during the four hundred years of\nthe siege, and he spent the time increasing the strength of his forces\nand creating new, deadlier creatures than Orcs for his armies. After\nreaching what he believed to be sufficient levels of soldiers, Morgoth's\narmies burst into Beleriand in the Dagor Bragollach. Accompanied by\nmassive volcanic eruptions, the Orcs, Balrogs, and the dragon Glaurung\ncompletely overran the Elven defenses surrounding Angband, driving far\ninto the south of Beleriand and slaughtering untold numbers of Elves.\nFingolfin's kingdom in Hithlum managed barely to defend itself, as the\nmountains surrounding it provided protection against the flame and magma\nMorgoth had caused to spew from the Iron Mountains around Angband. But\nmost of the other kingdoms of the Ñoldor were destroyed. The apparent\ntotality of the defeat caused a great wrath and despair to overcome\nFingolfin, and he resolved to go to Angband and challenge Morgoth\nhimself to single combat. He mounted his horse and proceeded to ride\nacross Anfauglith with such wrath that it was said that those who saw\nhim mistook him for the Vala Oromë. He rode to Angband, unhindered by\nany of Morgoth's servants, smote upon the gates of Angband and shouted\nhis challenge for all to hear, mocking Morgoth. Morgoth, though still\nsaid to be the “mightiest of all things in this world”, was reluctant to\nface Fingolfin, because despite his might, he alone of the Valar knew\nfear. But Fingolfin's insults could not be ignored without Morgoth\nlosing face before his captains. As such, he donned black armor, took up\na great mace, and emerged from Angband. Fingolfin drew his sword,\nRingil, and the duel began. Many times Morgoth attempted to smite\nFingolfin, but the Elven King managed to dodge all of Morgoth's blows,\nand wounded the Dark Lord seven times. But after a time, Fingolfin grew\nweary, and Morgoth beat him to the ground three times. Fingolfin rose up\nand continued to fight each time, but as Mandos had foretold, no power\nof the Elves could defeat Morgoth, a Vala. Eventually, Fingolfin\nstumbled backwards into one of the many pits carved by Morgoth's failed\nstrikes, and Morgoth stepped on the Elven King's neck and killed him.\nHowever, Fingolfin's last, desperate stroke managed to cut into\nMorgoth's heel.\n\nAfter defeating him, Morgoth took Fingolfin's body and broke it,\nintending to feed it to his wolves. But Thorondor, the King of Eagles,\nswooped down upon Morgoth and with his talons slashed at Morgoth's face.\nAs Morgoth reeled from this new assault, Thorondor retrieved Fingolfin's\nbody and brought it to a mountaintop overlooking Gondolin. Turgon built\na cairn over the remains of his father, and Fingon, in sorrow, became\nHigh King of the Ñoldor. After Fingolfin's defeat, though he had been\ndefeated by Morgoth, the Orcs never made any type of boastful song to\ncelebrate, nor did the Elves sing of it, for their sorrow was far too\ngreat. Morgoth walked with a limp after the duel, and the wounds he\nreceived pained him forever.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nFingolfin's father-name was ÑOLOFINWË “High Finwë”, from the Quenyan\n_ngolod_ (“wise”). His mother-name is ARAKÁNO “High Chieftain”, from\n_ara_ (“high”) and _káno_ (“chieftain”). The name _Fingolfin_ is\nthe Sindarin form of his name.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nFingolfin had another son, Argon, who was not mentioned in the published\n_The Silmarillion_. Argon is only mentioned in _The History of\nMiddle-earth_, in which it is told that he fought and died during the\nBattle of the Lammoth.\n\n\nTrivia\n\n-   In Chinese translation, FINGOLFIN was translated as “芬國盼”, while\n    “盼” reads as “Paan” in Chinese, “紛” should read as “Fin”. The name\n    “芬國盼” was mistranslated.\n\n\nGallery"

    "text": "FINGON, the Valiant was an Ñoldorin Elf, the eldest son of Fingolfin,\nand older brother of Turgon, Aredhel, and Argon.\n\nHe was High King of the Ñoldor in Middle-earth during the First Age\nafter the death of his father. He was an instrument in healing the rift\nbetween the Sons of Fëanor and the followers of his father after their\ndesertion of them in Araman.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nFingon was born in Aman, probably in Tirion where the House of Finwë was\nlocated. When the Ñoldor were resolved to return to Middle-earth, Fingon\nfollowed his father and his people, though they were drawn more to the\nruling of their own realms and adventurism rather than vengeance and the\nrecovery of the Silmarils, as Fëanor and his sons sought. He fought in\nthe first Kinslaying but only because he, seeing Elf fighting Elf,\nbelieved that the Teleri had been told to prevent the Ñoldor from\nleaving Aman by force by the Valar.\n\nAfter Fëanor's abandonment of them, Fingon and his people were led by\nFingolfin and crossed the perilous icy wastes of Helcaraxë. They arrived\nin Middle-earth at the beginning of the First Age and the Noldor\nwitnessed the arising of the Sun.\n\n\n\nAfter the Dagor-nuin-Giliath and the death of Fëanor, Maedhros, Fingon's\ncousin and friend, was taken and hung by the wrist upon Thangorodrim.\nFingon marched to Thangorodrim and with the help of Thorondor, Lord of\nthe Eagles, found Maedhros. Maedhros begged Fingon to kill him, but\nFingon instead severed Maedhros's hand by the wrist, and brought him\nback to the Noldorin camp. It was this act of bravery and compassion\nthat resolved the dispute as to whose house would rule over the Ñoldor\nin Middle-earth, for Maedhros renounced his claim to the High Kingship\nof the Ñoldor, instead ceding it to House of Fingolfin.\n\nFingolfin gave him a domain in Dor-lómin, in the west of Hithlum, where\nhe did good service during the Siege of Angband, defeating an Orc army\nthat attempted to go around to the north and attack Hithlum from the\nwest, and then later the first to fight against the dragon Glaurung when\nhe first came forth from Angband during the Dagor Aglareb.\n\nFingon became High King when Fingolfin died dueling with Morgoth after\nthe Dagor Bragollach. Seven years later, Morgoth's forces invaded\nHithlum, and Fingon was hard-pressed and outnumbered, but Círdan and the\npeople of the Falas, who came up the Firth of Drengist rescued them in\ntheir ships.\n\n\n\nFingon's final battle was the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. Fingon led the attack\non Angband, and the fury of his warriors nearly won the day.\nUnfortunately, due to Ulfang's treachery, Maedhros did not arrive until\nthree days after he was expected. This resulted in Morgoth releasing his\nBalrogs and Glaurung the dragon on the already weakened Ñoldor force.\nWhen Maedhros finally arrived, hope was reborn for Fingon's army;\nhowever, Ulfang's treachery again took effect, causing Maedhros to\nwithdraw. Fingon was then surrounded and his guards killed. He dueled\nGothmog, lord of Balrogs, but was struck from behind by another. Gothmog\nthen clove Fingon's helm, and fire sprang from it. This presumably\nkilled Fingon instantly, but the Balrogs proceeded to beat his body into\nthe dust long after he was dead. Thus the day ended in defeat for the\nelves.\n\nHis younger brother Turgon became the next rightful High King of the\nÑoldor, even though his host retreated after the battle and remained\nsecretly in Gondolin.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nHe was described as follows: “His valour was as a fire yet steadfast as\nthe hills of stone; wise he was and skilled in voice and hand; troth and\njustice he loved and bore goodwill to all, both Elves and Men, hating\nMorgoth only; he sought not his own, neither power nor glory, and death\nwas his reward.”\n\nThe only note of Fingon's physical appearance describes that Fingon\n“wore his long dark hair in great plaits braided with gold”.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Fingon_ is the Sindarin version of his Quenyan father-name\nFINDEKÁNO. The exact origin of the name Findekáno is unclear, but it\nmay possible be from the words _findë_ (“hair”) or _phin_ (“skill”), and\n_kane_ (“valour”) or _káno_ (“commander, lesser chief”).\n\nThe name Findekáno could mean either “cunning commander”, or rather\nunusually, “hair commander”. In Sindarin, _fin_ translates to\n“hair”.\n\n\nEarlier versions of the legendarium\n\nIn the published _The Silmarillion_, Fingon was the father of\nGil-galad, but Christopher Tolkien later said that this was due to\nan an error he made in editing the _The Silmarillion_, and that he\nbelieved his father's intention was that Gil-galad was the son of\nOrodreth of the House of Finarfin. This is a matter of lively academic\ndebate; there are some who say that we must believe what Tolkien's son\nsays about his intention, and therefore Gil-galad was the son of\nOrodreth, and others who say that the _The Silmarillion_ says he was the\nson of Fingon, and therefore we must go with the published canon.\nLogically ''The Silmarillion ''is canon as the high kingship belonged to\nthe House of Fingolfin, not the House of Finarfin, which entitled\nGil-galad to the Kingship. It is interesting to note that Gil-galad\nbecame High King of the Ñoldor when Turgon died, and not when Fingon\ndied.\n\n\nGallery"

    "name": "Finrod",
    "lotrUrl": "https://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Finrod",
    "race": "Elf",
    "text": "FINROD, also known fully as FINROD FELAGUND, was a Ñoldorin Elf who was\nborn in Aman, probably in Tirion. He was the eldest son of Finarfin and\nEärwen, and the brother of Galadriel, Angrod and Aegnor. Finrod was\none of the noblest elves of the House of Finarfin and a friend of Men.\nHis nobility and death saving Beren and his opposition to the Oath of\nFëanor allowed for his return to life in Valinor, making him the first\nElf to be reincarnated in the Undying Lands before the end of First Age.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nFinrod was friendly with Turgon and the House of Fingolfin. He opposed\nFëanor and the Oath when he sought to return to Middle-earth to recover\nthe Silmarils from Morgoth, but chose not to be parted with his friends\nand so he followed his father and his House and the House of Fingolfin.\nFinrod did not fight in the Kinslaying of Alqualondë nor was he aware of\nit as he continued the transit through Araman. While marching up the\ncoast, the host encountered a figure on a rock and heard the Prophecy of\nthe North. Afterwards, Finarfin and many of his followers departed and\nreturned to Tirion, but Finrod chose to continue onto Middle-earth with\nthe host of Fingolfin.\n\nFinrod founded the original Minas Tirith in the Pass of Sirion. In\naround FA 50, he and his friend Turgon, while journeying down the river\nSirion, encamped along its banks and were laid to rest by Ulmo. While\nasleep, Ulmo revealed to them the hidden realm of Nargothrond and the\nvalley of Tumladen. Finrod discovered the system of caves beneath the\nTaur-en-Faroth, protected by the Nagrod and the power of Ulmo, and here\nwent on to found his own kingdom and become Lord of Nargothrond.\n\nWhile hunting in the lands of Thargelion in East Beleriand, Finrod was\nfirst of the Ñoldor to come across Men. He stayed with them long,\nlearning their language and teaching them Sindarin. He also intervened\non behalf of the Laiquendi of Ossiriand, who feared Men would destroy\ntheir home, and he received the permission of King Thingol, who held\nrule over all Beleriand, to guide the Men to Estolad.\n\nFinrod had a close friendship with Andreth of the House of Bëor, whom he\noften visited during the Siege of Angband to converse with her on the\nmatters of Elves and Men. One such conversation was written down and\nlater known as _Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth_.\n\n\n\nDuring the Dagor Bragollach, Barahir of the House of Bëor saved Finrod's\nlife, and in friendship Finrod gave him his ring. This ring was later\nknown as the Ring of Barahir and was eventually handed down to Aragorn\nwhen told of his true identity. Years after the Dagor\nBragollach, Barahir's son Beren came to Nargothrond seeking help, and\nFinrod went with him on the Quest of the Silmaril to repay his debt,\nlaying down his kingship. Celegorm and Curufin, who were living in\nNargothrond at the time, persuaded (using fear of Morgoth, and barely\nveiled threats related to their Oath) most of Nargothrond to stay\nbehind; only ten warriors, headed by one, Edrahil, were faithful and\naccompanied their King.\n\nThough disguised by the arts of Finrod, the twelve were captured by\nSauron and taken to Tol-in-Gaurhoth, formerly Minas Tirith, the castle\nFelagund himself had built. Finrod and Sauron battled with songs of\npower but despite a great display of skill and power by the Elven\nprince, Sauron eventually caught him in a devious trap and prevailed.\nBut Sauron could not discern who exactly they were, even though they\nwere revealed to him. Sauron imprisoned them, seeking to learn their\nerrand and identities, sending a werewolf to devour them one by one\nuntil they revealed their secret, yet none did. Sauron however perceived\nthat Finrod was a High Elven Lord of great power, and purposed to save\nhim for last. Eventually, when the wolf came for Beren, Finrod burst his\nchains and killed the wolf barehanded but was mortally wounded\nhimself.\n\nFinrod loved Amarië, a Vanyarin Elf, who didn't follow him to\nMiddle-earth. For this, though she and Finrod were betrothed, Finrod\nnever married while in Middle-earth. It is noted in the _Lay of\nLeithian_ that Finrod was soon allowed to return to life in Valinor and\n“now dwells with Amarië” and was described as walking “with Finarfin his\nfather beneath the trees in Eldamar”. Even though Mandos foretold\nthat any of the exiles who died would never be allowed to leave his\nhalls, Finrod alone was allowed to reembody in Valinor.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Finrod_ is a Sindarin form of his Telerin (Quenya) name\nFINDARÁTO, with the approximate meaning “Mighty descendant of Finwë”.\nHis mother name is INGOLDO (“the Ñoldo”).\n\nFELAGUND is an Epessë given to him by the Dwarves that expanded the\ncaves of Nargothrond. It is actually of Dwarvish origin (or Sindarized\nKhuzdul) from the word _felak-gundu_ (“Hewer of Caves”).\n\nFinrod was also called by Bëor and his people NÓM (“Wisdom”), NÓMIN\n(“the Wise”), and “Friend-of-Men” which in elvish were\n_Edennil_ and _Atandil_, Sindarin and Quenya respectively.\n\nTitles\n\n-   Lord of Nargothrond\n\nEarlier names\n\nThe earlier name for Finrod, as told in _The History of Middle-earth,_\nwas _INGLOR_ FELAGUND.\n\n\nOther forms of the legendarium\n\nIn earlier versions of the Middle-earth myths and in the first edition\nof _The Lord of the Rings_, the name Finrod was given to the character\nlater known as Finarfin. Finrod Felagund was then named “Inglor\nFelagund”. Because of that, some people speculate that Gildor Inglorion\nwas Finrod's son, but there is much evidence to the contrary, which is\nfound on the page for Gildor Inglorion.\n\nIn the _The Silmarillion_, Orodreth is Finrod's brother. This was an\neditorial decision by Christopher Tolkien and an admitted mistake.\nOrodreth was actually the son of Angrod and thus Finrod's nephew."

    "text": "FINWË was the first High King of the Ñoldor who led his people on the\njourney from Middle-earth to Valinor in the blessed realm of Aman. He\nwas a great friend of Elu Thingol, the King of Doriath. He was the\nfather of Fëanor, Fingolfin, Finarfin, Írimë, and Findis. As founder of\nthe House of Finwë, he and his first and second wives were the sires of\nthe three noble houses of Fëanor, Fingolfin, Finarfin who afterwards\nruled great realms in Middle-earth, and succeeded him in Aman. His\nbloodline also mixed its way into the race of Men as well.\n\nFinwë was perhaps one of the firstborn Elves (created solely from Eru\nIlúvatar himself) who awoke in Cuiviénen.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nFinwë was born or perhaps awoke in Middle-earth in the far eastern land\nof Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees. When the Vala Oromë found\nthe Elves during his travels in Middle-earth, he loved them and urged\nthem to travel with him to Valinor to see its wondrous beauty. The Elves\nhowever, were suspicious of this call and were afraid and so Oromë chose\nambassadors to represent the three Elven-kindreds: the Vanyar, the\nÑoldor, and the Teleri, to represent their kindreds and to return and\nreport what they had saw. One of them was Finwë who along with Ingwë and\nElwë went to the Blessed Realm with Oromë. When they returned, they were\nable to convince the Elves to go on the Great Journey into the far West.\n\nThere was great friendship between Finwë of the Ñoldor and Elwë of the\nTeleri. Then each became leaders of their own Elven-kindred. Thus, Finwë\nbecame the Lord of the Ñoldor who led his people on the Great Journey.\nAnd eventually, Finwë and his people the Ñoldor arrived in Valinor\ndirectly behind the Vanyar. There he and his people settled and Finwë\nthus became the _First High King of the Ñoldor_.\n\n\n\nFinwë started a family first marrying Míriel Serindë who had also come\nwith her people the Ñoldor to Aman. They had a son called Fëanor but her\nlabors in giving birth to him drained her of most of her life, and she\ndied shortly after bearing him. After a period of mourning he married\nagain. His second wife was Indis of the Vanyar. Indis bore him four\nchildren: Fingolfin, Finarfin, Findis, and Irimë.\n\nWhen Melkor, now free from the Halls of Mandos began spreading lies\namongst the Ñoldor attempting to corrupt them, Finwë attempted to\nmoderate his people and lead them back to the Valar. But it was too\nlate, the Ñoldor had already begun to envision for themselves plans and\nnew dominions they could have ruled back in Middle-earth and were proud.\nHowever, Fëanor mistrusted the Valar and believed the lies and began to\nhorde his treasures and would only allow his beloved father or his sons\nto see the Silmarils. He also begun to suspect his half-brother was\ntrying to usurp him as the favored son, and made trouble in Tirion\ndrawing his sword on Fingolfin. For this he was banished from the city,\nbut Finwë loved his elder son greatly and shared his exile and went with\nhim northward and built the city/fortress of Formenos.\n\nThere Finwë lived with his son and his grandchildren and some of the\nrest of his house. Later, when Fëanor was summoned to Valmar to make\npeace with his brother, Finwë did not go out of bitterness over the\nexile of his son nor did he wish to meet the rest of his people because\nhe no longer felt like their king. There he was the first to be killed\nin Valinor when Melkor slew him at the doors of Formenos seeking the\nSilmarils. This act was the catalyst that led to the Revolt of the\nÑoldor.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nFinwë's name is not fully translated. The glossary in the Silmarillion\ntranslates _Fin_ as “hair”; other sources say it means “skill”.\n\n\nEarlier versions of the legendarium\n\nIn the first drafts of the genealogy, Finwë had four sons: the youngest\nwas named _Finrun_, but he was dropped after that, thus Finrod (later\nFinarfin) was Finwë's youngest son from then on.\n\nIn a later version Finwë had three daughters added by Indis, Findis (as\ntheir first child) Faniel (as their third), and Finvain (as their\nyoungest). In yet later versions, Faniel was apparently dropped, while\nFindis and Finvain were kept. Finvain (renamed Irimë) was moved to after\nFingolfin, thus Finarfin was once again the youngest child of Finwë."

    "text": "FËANOR was a Ñoldorin elf and one of the Elven kindred that departed\nfrom Valinor in the land of Aman, where they had lived with the Valar.\n\nHe was born in Valinor, the only child of Finwë, High King of the\nÑoldor, and Finwë's first wife Míriel Therindë. He was renowned as a\ncraftsman, gem-smith, and warrior, the maker of the Silmarils and\ninventor of the Tengwar script. He was also the creator of the seven\nPalantíri. He was made the mightiest in all parts of body and mind; of\nbeauty, understanding, skill, and subtlety, of all the Children of\nIlúvatar. However, his personality was riddled with flaws, foremost\namong them selfishness and pride, that ultimately led to him causing his\npeople untold anguish.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\n\n\nFëanor drew so much of Míriel's life energy when he was born that she\ngrew weary of living and her spirit voluntarily left her body, leaving\nher family for the Halls of Mandos. After a time, Finwë remarried and\nhad four more children; Fëanor's half-brothers Fingolfin and Finarfin,\nand half-sisters Findis and Irimë. Though he loved his father as dearly\nas a son could, Fëanor was not fond of his stepmother Indis nor her\nchildren, and so lived apart from her and his half-siblings. In his\nyouth, he quickly discovered his outstanding talents for craftsmanship\nand language. In his youth, he improved upon the work of Rúmil and\ncreated the system of writing known as Tengwar. He also became a student\nof Mahtan, a great smith who had learned his craft at the feet of Aulë\nhimself. From Mahtan, he learned much of metallurgy, and at some point\nhe wedded Mahtan's daughter Nerdanel, who bore him seven sons: Maedhros,\nMaglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod, and Amras. He spent most of\nhis time either alone or with his sons, and they were all completely\nloyal to him. He also was known to have been restless, exploring as much\nof Aman as he could and constantly crafting new works.\n\nThe Making of the Silmarils\n\nBy far the greatest of Fëanor's crafting achievements was the creation\nof the _Silmarils_, also called the Great Jewels. To make them, Fëanor\ncaptured some of the intermingled light from the Two Trees of Valinor\nand, by unknown means, locked it into three large diamond-like gems. His\ncreations garnered him great praise, and he came to prize the Silmarils\nabove all else. However, as time went on, he began to covet the gems\nwith a greedy love, and he increasingly ignored the fact that the light\nwhich lay in the gems and gave them their beauty was not of his own\nmaking. Fëanor alternated between vainly displaying the jewels and\njealously guarding them from all but his immediate family, though\neventually he came to the point where they almost always remained under\nlock and key.\n\nThe Wiles of Morgoth\n\n\n\nAfter three ages of imprisonment, Melkor, the mightiest of the Valar and\nthe world's primordial source of evil, deceived the Valar with a false\nshow of repentance. Pardoned and residing in Valinor, his malice had in\nfact reached hitherto unprecedented level, and its primary target\nquickly became the Elves, as it had been for their sake that he had been\noverthrown. He found that, of the three primary groups of Elves in\nValinor, the Ñoldor were the easiest to manipulate due to their thirst\nfor knowledge and willingness to listen. Focusing his efforts solely on\nthe Ñoldor, he subtly spread lies amongst them that the Valar were\nkeeping them imprisoned in Valinor so that the race of Men might inherit\nMiddle-earth and claim the glory that could have been theirs. Although\nFëanor mistrusted and feared Melkor, in his arrogance and impatience he\noften unwittingly repeated the lies of Melkor. He quickly became the\nmost prominent of the rebellious Ñoldor, to the point where the other\nValar, not knowing of Melkor's lies, saw him as the source of the\nÑoldor's distemper.\n\nMelkor coveted the Silmarils and hated Fëanor, but he hid his intentions\nfrom the Ñoldor and the Valar as the situation continued to deteriorate.\nMelkor's lies eventually came to the point where rumors began to\ncirculate amongst some that Fëanor's half-brother Fingolfin was planning\nnot only to usurp his place as heir to Finwë, but also to seize the\nSilmarils for himself. In his pride and vanity, Fëanor took little\nconvincing, and his hostility grew to the point to where he threatened\nFingolfin with violence. The Valar, having put up with Fëanor's\nrabble-rousing for some time, could not ignore the transgression of\nbreaking the peace of Valinor and so summoned Fëanor to the Ring of Doom\nto explain himself. Fëanor's testimony revealed the malice of Melkor and\nhis lies, and Tulkas immediately left the Ring to apprehend him again.\nDespite Melkor having been the true root of the Ñoldor's unrest,\nFëanor's crime had been of his own making, and for this the Valar exiled\nhim to Formenos. He took a substantial treasure with him, including the\nSilmarils, which he put in a locked box. In a show of support for his\neldest son, Finwë also withdrew to Formenos and renounced the kingship\nso long as Fëanor remained in exile.\n\n\n\nSome time later, Melkor unexpectedly appeared at Formenos where he tried\nto sway Fëanor to his side, proclaiming that the Valar had treated him\nunjustly. However, Fëanor realized that Melkor's true goal was to obtain\nthe Silmarils, and he vehemently dismissed the fallen Vala. Melkor left\nin a rage and fled from Valinor. He feigned to go north, but ultimately\nturned south, passing as a cloud to the unexplored southern coast of\nAman. The Valar later sought to mend the breach between Fëanor and\nFingolfin, and invited them to Valinor to make peace. Fingolfin offered\na hand to his half-brother, recognizing Fëanor's place as the eldest,\nbut it was returned by Fëanor somewhat grudgingly.\n\nRape of the Silmarils\n\nMelkor stole away to Avathar in the south of Aman. There he discovered\nthe evil spider-like creature Ungoliant and secured her as an ally,\npromising that her unrelenting hunger would be satisfied in return for\nher aid. During the festivities at which Fëanor and Fingolfin had\nreconciled, Melkor and Ungoliant destroyed the Two Trees and plunged\nValinor into complete darkness. Melkor and Ungoliant then went to\nFormenos, where Melkor slew Finwë and ransacked the vault, taking the\nSilmarils and many other treasures. They then escaped by crossing the\nHelcaraxë, or Grinding Ice, in the north to Beleriand in Middle-earth.\nThough the Valar attempted pursuit, it was ultimately in vain, for the\nUnlight of Ungoliant completely obscured the sight of the pursuers.\n\nThe Valar quickly realized that with the Trees dead, their light\nsurvived only in the Silmarils. To restore the Trees and foil Melkor's\nmalice, Yavanna asked Fëanor to give up the Silmarils so that they could\nbe broken, and the light within them released. But Fëanor emphatically\nstated that he would not give up his Silmarils of his own free will, and\nproclaimed that if the Valar forced him to do so that they would be no\nbetter than Melkor. Ultimately however, Fëanor's selfishness made little\ndifference, for a messenger from Formenos then arrived to deliver the\nnews of Finwë's death and the loss of the Silmarils.\n\nThe Flight of the Ñoldor\n\n\n\nFëanor, upon learning of his father's murder and the theft of his prized\nSilmarils, named Melkor “Morgoth”, or “Black Foe of the World”\n(literally “Black Enemy”). As he did so, a great rage and despair\ngripped him, for his love for his father had run deep, and he fled in\ngrief from the Ring of Doom. Now King of the Ñoldor after the death of\nhis father, Fëanor returned to Tirion, ignoring the fact that he was\nstill technically exiled, and gave one of the most impassioned speeches\never delivered in Arda. However, due to his rage, grief, and pride, he\nunwittingly filled his speech with many of the lies and half-truths of\nMorgoth. He railed against the Dark Lord, but he also blamed the Valar\nin part for Morgoth's deeds, claiming that they should have been able to\nstop him and had failed. He spoke of the fact that because Morgoth had\nattacked and badly marred the kingdom of the Valar without consequence\nto himself, there was neither bliss nor surety of safety to be found in\nAman any longer. He evoked images of the kingdoms his people could build\nin Middle-earth, and the glory that could be theirs once they regained\nthe Silmarils. Fëanor then swore an oath by the name of Ilúvatar himself\nthat he would suffer none, no matter their race or reasons, to withhold\na Silmaril from him, and that he would pursue with violence any who\nattempted it. The Oath of Fëanor was also taken by his seven sons below\nthe tower of the Mindon Eldaliéva in the Great Square of Tirion. This\noath was the cause for great tragedy for Fëanor's family, and for the\nEldar in general.\n\nHis impassioned speech swayed most of those present, but even with his\ntremendous oratory skill, dissension quickly arose regarding who should\nlead the hosts to Middle-earth. For though Fëanor was technically High\nKing, he was not well liked amongst the Ñoldor, and many of them were\nnot of mind to accept him as king. Greater love was given to Fingolfin\nand his sons, and most of the Ñoldor desired greatly that Fingolfin and\nhis sons should go with them and lead them. Fingolfin was not eager to\ngo, but he had sworn to uphold his brother's rights as the eldest, and\nfurthermore he did not wish to leave his people to the mercy of Fëanor's\nrash and often selfish courses of action. Additionally, his son Fingon\nwas eager to undertake the journey, and urged his father to come with\nhim. Thus against his wisdom, Fingolfin marched with a second and larger\nhost than Fëanor, while Finarfin commanded a third, smaller, and quite\nreluctant host. However even with the three sons of Finwë leading the\nway, about a tenth of the Ñoldor chose simply to stay in Tirion, some\nfor the love of Tirion and others for love of the Valar.\n\nThe First Kinslaying\n\n\n\nAfter delivering his speech and departing with his host, Fëanor's mood\ncooled somewhat and he belatedly realized that he had no practical means\nof delivering himself and his people to Middle-earth. For though\nMiddle-earth and Aman were connected in those days by the Helcaraxë, a\ntreacherous and bitterly cold region of shifting arctic ice, it was\ndeemed to be impassable. Fëanor then gave thought to the building of\nships, but there were no shipwrights amongst the Ñoldor and even had\nthere been, crafting a fleet large enough to ferry all of his people to\nMiddle-earth would have been a monumental and time consuming task.\nFëanor therefore went to Alqualondë where the seafaring Teleri lived and\nattempted to persuade them to join him, or failing that, secure the use\nof their ships. But the Teleri had no desire whatsoever to leave Aman\nand would not give Fëanor their ships, for they held them too dearly.\nFëanor angrily cited that the Teleri owed the Ñoldor for instructing\nthem in the arts of crafting buildings and cities. But Olwë, the lord of\nthe Teleri, was unmoved, and rebuffed again in friendship what he saw as\ngreat folly by Fëanor and his kin.\n\nBut Fëanor would not take no for an answer. He understood that many of\nhis people had been inflamed by his impassioned words, and knew that\nhaste was essential to keep cooler heads from swaying the Ñoldor to a\nmore reasonable course. As such, he persuaded his host to aid him in\ntaking the ships by force. This he attempted, and the Teleri resisted,\ncasting many of the the Ñoldor into the sea and thrice driving them back\ndespite being far more lightly armed than the Ñoldor. However,\nFingolfin's host, which had been slower and less eager to start the\njourney, came upon the battle in progress. Believing that the Teleri had\nbeen the aggressors, perhaps on the orders of the Valar themselves,\nFingolfin's host came to the aid of his brother's and the Teleri were\novercome. The ships were stolen, and many of the Teleri mariners were\nwickedly slain. After commandeering the ships, the Ñoldor, their hosts\nlessened by battle and by terrible storms conjured by Ossë in vengeance\nfor the Teleri, encountered a figure that may have been Mandos himself.\nThis figure uttered a terrible Doom, exiling the Ñoldor from Valinor and\nforetelling that their war against Morgoth would cause them only misery.\nDue to their wickedness in slaughtering their kin, they would be utterly\nforsaken in the eyes of the Valar, and would receive neither welcome nor\naid from Valinor in their struggles. Additionally, Fëanor and his house\nwere cursed, and Mandos foretold great suffering and hardship would be\ntheir lot, due in no small part to the oath they had taken to regain the\nSilmarils at all costs. Above all, the figure made it explicitly clear\nthat any war made by the Ñoldor against Morgoth would be utterly\nhopeless, for the Ñoldor, being Elves, did not have the power to\novercome a Vala. Hearing this Doom, and having not participated in the\nKinslaying, Finarfin and his host and turned back in grief, cursing\nFëanor. They were pardoned and accepted by the Valar, and\nFinarfin ruled as High-King of the Ñoldor in Tirion. Fëanor, however,\ndefied the Doom and proceeded onward. As such the journey northward\ncontinued, the land became ever darker, and the temperatures began to\ndrop dramatically as the Ñoldor began to approached the Helcaraxë. Many\nof the Ñoldor, already reluctant to follow Fëanor, began to openly\nexpress dissatisfaction with his actions as conditions continued to\ndeteriorate. Fëanor was all too aware of this and sought counsel with\nhis sons. For despite having succeeded in seizing the Teleri fleet, the\nstorms of Ossë had wreaked many of the ships, and there were no longer\nenough to bear all of the Ñoldor at once to Middle-earth. But due to\nfear of treachery, none were willing to be left in Aman while others\ncrossed the sea first.\n\n\n\nHowever, Fëanor's most loyal forces had maintained control of the Teleri\nfleet after having seized it. As the dissent grew worse, Fëanor decided\nto simply abandon all those whose loyalty to him was not absolute, and\nhe and his followers slipped away one night in the ships. They arrived\nat Losgar, in the land of Lammoth, in the far west of Beleriand, where\nMorgoth and Ungoliant had passed not long before, and upon arriving,\nFëanor decided to burn the ships and leave the followers of Fingolfin\nbehind. The earth, being flat in those days, allowed the remaining\nÑoldor to see the flames, and they perceived that they were betrayed.\nFingolfin now had the choice of either returning to Tirion in disgrace,\nor proceeding to Middle-earth across the treacherous Helcaraxë.\nFingolfin and his people chose to attempt the crossing, as many of\nFingolfin's host wished to continue and many, including Fingolfin\nhimself, were eager to confront Fëanor and his people over their\nbetrayal. The journey was a long and terrible one, and Fingolfin's host\nsuffered great losses along the way, which added to the bitterness they\nfelt for Fëanor and his sons.\n\nFinal Battle and Death\n\nLearning of the Ñoldor's arrival, Morgoth summoned his armies from his\nfortress of Angband and attacked Fëanor's encampment in Mithrim. This\nconfrontation was called the Battle under the Stars, or\n_Dagor-nuin-Giliath_, for the Sun and Moon had not yet been made. The\nÑoldor won the battle handily, and destroyed Morgoth's armies. But\nFëanor, exhilarated by the victory and ever prideful, pressed on toward\nAngband far ahead of his army with only a small vanguard. As he\napproached Angband, the Orcs, seeing that Fëanor's numbers were so few,\nturned and gave battle. Due to their proximity to Angband, they were\nreinforced by a number of Balrogs, who quickly slew most of the Elves.\nBut Fëanor was undaunted, and though he was dealt many wounds, he long\nfought on alone. At last however, he was stricken to the ground by\nGothmog, the Lord of the Balrogs.  Fortunately for Fëanor, his sons\narrived with a substantial relief force. The Balrogs returned to\nAngband, and Fëanor's sons took him from the battlefield. However,\nFëanor knew that his wounds were mortal, and bade his sons to stop. He\nlooked upon Angband and cursed Morgoth thrice, but gazing upon the sheer\nscope of Morgoth's stronghold, he understood at last the truth of\nMandos's words; that no force of the Ñoldor would ever overthrow the\nDark Lord. Nevertheless, he instructed his sons to keep to their oath\nand avenge their father. As he died, his fiery spirit left his body and\nburned it to ash.\n\nLegacy\n\nOn Fëanor's passing, his son Maedhros became High King of the Ñoldor.\nMaedhros, however, met Fingolfin soon after and gave the kingship to him\nout of respect, a desire to keep his people united, and an\nacknowledgment that, as Finwë's oldest surviving son, the kingship ought\nto pass to him by right of birth. Fingolfin's descendents would\nreign over the Nôldor until the death of Gil-galad many centuries later.\nFëanor's deeds, many of which were infamously despicable, cast a shadow\nover the interactions between the Silvan Elves and the returning Ñoldor.\nFor Thingol, the King of Doriath, eventually learned of the kinslaying,\nthe burning of the ships at Losgar, and the curse of Mandos. As the\nTeleri were of Thingol's own kin, he was enraged to hear of the\nmerciless and needless slaughter. The sons of Finarfin he came to\nforgive, as they were of his own kin and had not participated in the\nevil. Those of Fingolfin's host, who had endured the horror of crossing\nthe Helcaraxë after Fëanor's betrayal, he held as having suffered enough\nhardship to redress their ills. But all those who had followed Fëanor,\nwere of his kin, or were friends of his kin, Thingol held in contempt\nand would have as little to do with as he could. Fëanor's remaining sons\nwere still bound by the Oath to recover the Silmarils, and this oath\nwould eventually see two more Kinslayings come to pass, each more\nhorrific than the last, and would work to undermine the Elven war\nagainst Morgoth in many important ways. The Doors of Durin would later\nbear the emblem of the House of Fëanor: a single star with many rays.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nOriginally named _Finwë_ or _Finweminya_ after his father, and later\n_CURUFINWË_ (“Skillful  Finwë”), he was the greatest of the\nÑoldor, and very briefly their king. His name is a compromise between\nthe Sindarin _Faenor_ and the Quenya _FËANÁRO_, meaning “Spirit of\nfire”.\n\n\nAppearances in the Books\n\n-   _The Silmarillion: Quenta Silmarillion_\n-   _The History of Middle-earth, Vol. XII: The Peoples of Middle-earth_\n-   _The Lord of the Rings_ (mentioned only)"

    "text": "FÍLI and KÍLI were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen dwarves who\nset out on Thorin Oakenshield's quest along with Gandalf and Bilbo\nBaggins to reclaim the Lonely Mountain for the Dwarves.\n\nFíli and Kíli were the two most active dwarves of Thorin's company, and\napart from Balin, and possibly Bombur, they appeared more frequently as\n“individual” characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest of Thorin's\ncompanions, who were most often named only in “group” references to the\nentire company.\n\n\nBiography\n\nFíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their\nmother Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II,\nand great-grandsons of Thror. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his\nlong nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves on the Quest of Erebor.\n\nAs the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes so they\nwere often sent scouting or searching. They found the Goblins' cave in\nthe Misty Mountains.\n\n \n\nWith the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later\nimprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil.  They escaped with the help of\nBilbo, through barrels and traveled down the river until they reached\nLake-town. The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town\nwhile the others rested by the river.\n\nOn the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and\nfound the Front Gate with Balin and Bilbo. Also, with Bilbo, they found\nthe side-door leading inside the mountain.\n\nBoth brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin\nOakenshield in the Battle of the Five Armies, and all three were buried\nwith honor.\n==Talents and Equipment==\n\nWhile on journeys, Fili, and Kili both wore blue hoods, and played\nfiddles. However Fili carried a spade, (Presumably to forage, and to aid\nin building firepits, as well as a tool for barriars, and traps.) and\nwhile the books made no mention of Kili carrying a bow, it is presumed\nby readers.\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nAlthough Fíli is described as being the youngest in Chapter 8 of _The\nHobbit_, in _Appendix A_ of _The Lord of the Rings_ his birth year is\ngiven as TA 2859 whereas Kíli's is given as TA 2864.\n\nSome readers have pointed out the interesting fact that Fíli and Kili\nare the only two Dwarves of Thorin's company to die at the Battle of\nFive Armies, despite being more popular and certainly treated more\nsympathetically by Tolkien than the rest. From this perspective, the\n“singling out” of Fíli and Kili for death appears unusual. There are two\npossible (and not mutually exclusive) explanations for why Tolkien chose\nto treat these characters in this way.\n\nThorin Oakenshield was Fíli's and Kíli's maternal uncle. They were his\n“sister-sons.” Tolkien often referred to the special relationship\nbetween maternal uncle and nephew in early Anglo-Saxon culture. In his\n1953 essay and play about the Battle of Maldon, “The Homecoming of\nBeorhtnoth, Beorhthelm's Son,” Tolkien refers to this bond twice; once\nin the essay itself and again during an exchange between the play's two\ncharacters, Tidwald and Torthelm. Torthelm, stumbling upon a slain\nEnglish knight whom he mistakenly believes is Beorthnoth's nephew,\nexclaims “His sister-son! The songs tell us, ever near shall be at need\nnephew to uncle.” Another example of this special bond is the\nrelationship between Théoden and Éomer in _The Lord of the Rings_. Éomer\nis the son of Théoden's sister.\n\nViewed in this context, Fíli's and Kíli's defending Thorin to their\ndeath is a perfect example of the Old English concept of a special bond\nof love and loyalty between uncle and nephew.\n\nA possible second factor in Tolkien's decision to kill off the two\nyounger Dwarves at the end of _The Hobbit_ concerns the succession to\nthe throne of the Lonely Mountain. Thorin, patriarchal head of Durin's\nFolk, becomes King Under the Mountain upon the death of the dragon\nSmaug. Dáin Ironfoot, his cousin and the eldest surviving direct\ndescendant of Durin, succeeds him. However, had Fíli and Kíli not been\nkilled at the Battle of Five Armies, then one of the two brothers would\nhave assumed the kingship, as they would have been the sole surviving\nheirs of the senior line. If the genealogy cited above in Appendix A of\n_The Lord of the Rings_ is correct, Fíli would have been King under the\nMountain. If Thorin's statement in _The Hobbit_ that Fíli was the\nyoungest is correct, then Kíli, as the older brother, would have become\nking. It could be that Tolkien had already envisioned the venerable Dáin\nas becoming king after the battle, and that he felt it would be somewhat\nawkward for one of the two young brothers to become King and play such a\ncentral role; when he noticed the problem of succession as he revised\nthe book's draft, he decided that the noble deaths of the Dwarves\ndefending Thorin was a fitting end.\n\nA final note sometimes raised by fans of Tolkien's works concerns the\nage of Gimli relative to Fíli and Kíli. In the story of “The Quest for\nErebor” that appears in Tolkien's _Unfinished Tales_, Gimli states that\nhe was considered too young to join Thorin and Company on the quest.\nGimli, according to Appendix A, was born in TA 2879, and was therefore\n62 years old when the Dwarves and Bilbo set out for the Lonely Mountain.\nFíli and Kíli, his cousins, were slightly older, being 82 and 77 years\nold respectively (if Appendix A is accepted as accurate). All three were\nstill “minors” according to Dwarf-reckoning, and given that Dwarves\ncommonly lived to over 250 years old, the age differences between the\nthree young Dwarves were minimal, but Fíli and Kíli were Thorin's\nnephews, as well as his heirs, and therefore had a much stronger reason\nto accompany Thorin on the quest to restore his kingdom, while Gimli\nremained in the Blue Mountains (Ered Luin) with his mother.\n\n\nAppearance in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   ''The Hobbit ''{First appearance)\n-   _Unfinished Tales_\n\nIn the films\n\n-   _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_\n-   _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_\n-   _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\n\n\nIn the animated version of _The Hobbit_, their roles are relatively\nminor compared to the book and have few lines; both brothers are voiced\nby Don Messick.\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\nIn Peter Jackson's _The Hobbit_ film Trilogy, Fíli is portrayed by Dean\nO'Gorman and Kíli by Aidan Turner. While in the book they both have\nyellow hair and beards, in the films, only Fíli has golden hair, while\nKíli has dark brown, almost black hair (an orc refers to him as “the\nblack-haired archer”). The following is from information released by the\nstudio:\n\n  _Fíli was born into the royal line of Durin and raised under the stern\n  guardianship of his uncle, Thorin Oakenshield. Along with his brother\n  Kíli, Fíli is one of the youngest dwarves of The Company. He has never\n  travelled far, nor ever seen the fabled Dwarf City of Erebor. A\n  skilled fighter, Fíli sets off on the adventure ahead with little idea\n  of the challenges and dangers that lie before him._\n\n  _Younger brother to Fíli, Kíli is a loyal nephew to Thorin\n  Oakenshield. Carefree and somewhat reckless, Kíli has led a charmed\n  and untroubled life to this point. Handsome and physically able, Kíli\n  possesses the invincible courage of youth. He is a skilled fighter and\n  expert archer, having been trained with weapons from an early age. As\n  one of the youngest of the Company of Dwarves, Kíli is determined to\n  make his mark and prove his worth._\n\nAs in the books, Fíli and Kíli serve as the scouts of the Company. It is\nthey who discover the ponies have gone missing in the Trollshaws and\ninvestigate the trolls with Bilbo. Kíli is distinguished as the only\nmember of the Company who carries a bow (unlike in the book, which\nimplies more than one dwarf had a bow), and he is shown to have\nproficient aim, taking out several wargs when the Company are attacked\non their way to Rivendell.\n\nFíli and Kíli are also shown as being some of the more adept fighters of\nthe company. They, along with Dwalin, charge to the defence of Bilbo and\nattack Azog's wargs when cornered on the clifftop. Kíli also kills\nGrinnah in the fight in the caves where “Goblin Town” is located.\n\nIn _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_, a romantic subplot develops\nbetween Kíli and Tauriel, a Silvan elf who is a captain of Thranduil's\nelven guard in Mirkwood. When Kíli is surrounded by several spiders and\nis left with no weapons to defend himself, Elves, led by Legolas and\nTauriel, arrive and rescue Kíli from the spiders. Later, Tauriel notices\nKíli holding a small talisman and inquires about it. He tells her that\nthe talisman reminds him of the promise to return he made to his mother,\nDís. They begin to talk, with Tauriel telling of her elven love for the\nstars, and Kíli telling of the time he saw a great blood-moon\n(presumably a lunar eclipse), while Legolas listens unobserved from the\nshadows.\n\nSoon the Company is rescued by Bilbo, using barrels from the wine\ncellars to escape. In the river they are stopped by the Elven-guard, who\nswing shut a portcullis across a narrow place in the river to block\ntheir passage, when suddenly both elves and Dwarves are attacked by Bolg\nand his orc troops. Kíli climbs up to operate the mechanism for opening\nthe portcullis and is injured by an arrow to the leg. Tauriel saves him\nonce again, Kíli is able to open the portcullis, and he continues down\nthe river with the rest of the Company. Later Tauriel, having learned\nfrom an orc captive that the arrow wounding Kíli was poisoned, follows\nthe Dwarves (accompanied by Legolas) in order to save him.\n\nIn Lake-town, Kíli becomes gravely ill from the poisoned arrow and\nThorin orders him left behind. Óin stays behind to tend him, and, when\nFíli fails to change Thorin's mind, he defies his uncle in order to stay\nbehind as well to be with his brother. Bofur is also left behind, having\nwaken up too late after the dwarf's drunken celebration the night\nbefore. The dwarves take refuge in Bard's home. Oin asks Bard if there\nis any kingsfoil and Bard says it's a weed they use to feed the pigs, so\nBofur sets off to get some. Meanwhile, Bolg arrives and attacks the\nplace, searching for Thorin. Legolas and Tauriel arrive just in time to\nkill the orcs. As Legolas runs after the escaping Bolg, Tauriel stays\nand uses the kingsfoil Bofur has brought back (which she recognizes as\nathelas) to tend to Kíli's wound. Kíli, half in delirium, watches\nTauriel as she heals him, speaking aloud of her beauty (to himself, as\nthough believing himself to be in a dream) and wondering whether she\ncould ever love him. Tauriel seems quite touched, and they hold hands.\n\n\n\nIn _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_, Fíli and Kíli survive\nthe attack on Laketown by Smaug, and proceed to Erebor along with Bofur\nand Oin. During the Battle of the Five Armies, Thorin takes Fíli, Kíli,\nand Dwalin to pursue Azog. Thorin sends Fíli and Kíli to scout, not\nknowing they are about to be overrun by a second army of Gundabad Orcs.\nBilbo comes to warn them, but it is too late. Fíli is the first one to\nbe captured, and is later impaled by Azog in front of Thorin, Bilbo, and\nDwalin. Kíli, who is hiding underneath, sees the body of Fíli drop down.\nHe attacks the orcs in rage, and is later confronted by Bolg. He saves\nTauriel from being attacked by Bolg, but it mortally wounded during the\nfight. Kíli dies with Tauriel by his side.\n\nNon-canonical Weapons\n\nAs shown in _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_ film, Fíli wields\nvarious weapons and hides them in his person. His most commonly used\nweapons are dual swords, knives, throwing axes, and a war hammer. Kíli,\non the other hand, is the Company's archer, but is also shown using a\nsword.\n\n\nTrivia\n\n-   The romantic subplot between Kili and Tauriel is similar to Romeo\n    and Juliet, in that both of them are from people who don't get\n    along, their romance is doomed from the beginning, it develops a\n    connection with the audience, and the romance ends in disaster. The\n    only difference is that Legolas, who represents Paris, survives\n    along with Tauriel, who represents Juliet, while Kili is dead along\n    with Fili and Thorin who represents the house of Montague."

She had two\nbrothers, Artamir and Faramir, who were both future heirs to the\nsouthern kingdom of Gondor. Fíriel was wedded to Prince Arvedui of Arnor\nin TA 1940 during a time when Arvedui's father Araphant made an alliance\nwith Ondoher. They had one son named Aranarth.

    "race": "Elf",
    "text": "GALADRIEL was the co-ruler and Lady of Lothlórien alongside her husband,\nLord Celeborn - however, neither of them took royal titles, as they only\nsaw themselves as the Guardians of The Golden Wood.\n\nShe was the only daughter and youngest child of Finarfin, prince of the\nÑoldor and of Eärwen, whose cousin was Lúthien. Her elder brothers were\nFinrod Felagund,  Orodreth, Angrod, and Aegnor. Galadriel was a niece\nof Fëanor, one of the most important elves of the First Age.\n\nShe was one of the greatest of the Eldar in Middle-earth, and surpassed\nnearly all others in beauty, knowledge, and power. She was also the\nbearer of Nenya, one of the three Elven rings of power. Tolkien thought\nof her, along with Gil-galad the Elven-king, as one of the mightiest and\nfairest of all the Elves left in Middle-earth.\n\n\nBiography\n\nYears of the Trees\n\n\n\nGaladriel was born in Valinor during the Years of the Trees, before the\nFirst Age had even begun. Much of Galadriel's story is confusing, and\nthere are several distinct tales told about her collected in the\nUnfinished Tales. According to the older account, used in the published\n_Silmarillion_, Galadriel was an eager participant and leader in the\nrebellion of the Ñoldor and their flight from Valinor due to her desire\nto one day rule over a patch of Middle-earth herself.\n\nShe was eager to see Middle-earth, having heard of it from Fëanor, and\nwanted to rule a realm of her own. She swore no oaths and was like\nminded with her cousin Fingon, son of Fingolfin.\n\nHowever, separated from Fëanor and his kin, she and her people did not\ntake part in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë. They followed Fingolfin\ninstead and crossed the Helcaraxë in the far north.\n\nFirst Age\n\nOnce in Beleriand, she lived nominally with one of her brothers, most\nlikely Finrod, but spent much time at the court of Thingol and Melian in\nMenegroth, where she arrived in FA 52 and was welcomed because of her\nfamily relationship to Thingol's brother Olwë, Galadriel's maternal\ngrandfather. She met Celeborn, a kinsman of Thingol, in Doriath. She\nalso traveled to visit her brother, Finrod, in his realm of Nargothrond\nmultiple times. Her three other brothers were killed during various\nbattles in the First Age.\n\nGaladriel became friends with Melian the Maia, who wanted to know the\ncause of the exile of the Ñoldor. Galadriel only briefly narrated the\nstory to her, leaving out the death of Finwë, the Kinslaying at\nAlqualondë, and the burning of the ships at Losgar. She dwelt in\nNargothrond with her brother Finrod, and asked him if he would take no\nwife. But Finrod had taken an oath only for himself, and his beloved had\nbeen left in Valinor.\n\nShe played a relatively insignificant part in the wars of the First Age,\nas she thought that defeating Morgoth was beyond the power of the Eldar,\nand when Morgoth was defeated by the coming of the Valar out of the West\nshe, having played no part in the Kinslaying, was offered safe return to\nValinor. But being prideful, she chose to remain in Middle-earth.\n\nSecond Age\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel traveled first to Lindon, where they ruled over a\ngroup of Elves as a fiefdom under Gil-galad. Sometime later, they had a\ndaughter, Celebrían. They moved eastward and established the realm of\nEregion, or Hollin, which they ruled under Gil-galad, the High King of\nthe Ñoldor. Eregion, to the west of the Misty Mountains near Moria, was\na prosperous kingdom during this time, and had open trade with the\nDwarves. Also, during this time, they made contact with a Nandorin\nsettlement in the valley of the Anduin, later to be known as Lothlórien.\nSubsequently, while Celebrimbor now ruled over Eregion, they left\nEregion by way of the mines of Khazad-dûm and became the Lord and Lady\nof Lothlórien.\n\n\n\nDuring the Second Age, the Maia Annatar, the “Lord of Gifts”, guided\nCelebrimbor and the other Ñoldor of Eregion in the creation of the Rings\nof Power. Galadriel took an immediate distrust to Annatar, and it later\nturned out that this mistrust was justified, as he was finally revealed\nto be Sauron. It was she who counseled Celebrimbor in the hiding of the\nrings, and when Eregion was attacked, Galadriel was entrusted with one\nof the Three Rings of the Elves. Her ring was Nenya, the Ring of Water.\n\nConscious of Sauron's power, and wishing to thwart it, she did not\nopenly use the powers of her ring as long as the One Ring was in\nSauron's hands. However, during the Third Age, when the One Ring was\nlost, she put it to good use protecting the borders of her realm, for\nthe powers of her ring were protection, preservation, and concealment\nfrom evil.\n\nThird Age\n\nThrough Celebrían's wedding to Elrond, Galadriel was the grandmother of\nElladan, Elrohir, and Arwen.\n\nThe tales tell little of Galadriel or of Celeborn during many centuries\nin the Third Age, but after the formation of the White Council in TA\n2463 she put forth her might in opposition of Sauron. She played a\npivotal role in the formation of the Council, though her counsel to put\nGandalf at its head was not followed. After Sauron was ousted from\nhis fortress of Dol Guldur, Lórien kept vigilance over the region until\nthe time of the War of the Ring.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Galadriel hosted the Fellowship of the Ring\nafter their escape from the mines of Moria.\n\nOnce in Caras Galadhon, Galadriel allowed Frodo and Sam to peer into the\nMirror of Galadriel, enabling them to glimpse possible events of the\nfuture. She, in turn, was tested when Frodo Baggins later offered to\nplace the One Ring in her keeping. To illustrate what would happen if\nshe accepted, she presented an image of herself corrupted by the ring,\ndeclaring, “_In place of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And I\nshall not be dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the\nNight! Fair as the Sea and the Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain!\nDreadful as the Storm and the Lightning! Stronger than the foundations\nof the earth. All shall love me and despair!_” In the movie, what she\nsays is different, which is: \"_In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a\nqueen! Not dark, but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Treacherous as\nthe sea! Stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love me,\nand despair!\"_\n\nThen swiftly she returned to her original form, seemingly smaller and\nfrailer than before, declaring, “_I pass the test,_” refusing the Ring\nand accepting the fate of diminishing (as the time of the Dominion of\nMen had come), and returning at last to Valinor. As the Fellowship\ndeparted, she gave each member a gift and an Elven cloak, and outfitted\nthe party with boats and supplies. Gimli, in particular, was touched by\nGaladriel's lordliness and beauty, and asks for one strand of her golden\nhair as an heirloom of his house; she generously gave him three, which\nhe later set in an impregnable crystal.\n\nApart from the strands of hair given to Gimli, she gave a Mallorn seed\nand a small box of earth from her garden to Samwise Gamgee; a green\nstone set in silver to Aragorn, along with a scabbard for his sword; and\na belt each to Boromir, Merry, and Pippin. To Legolas she gave a long,\nstout bow of the Galadhrim. To Frodo she gave a magical phial, which\ncaptured the light of Eärendil's star, without which Frodo and Sam would\nhave been unable to pass through Shelob's lair to complete their quest.\nAfter the departure of the Fellowship, Galadriel acted to ensure the\nsuccess of the quest. It was she who summoned Gwaihir to rescue Gandalf\noff the peak of Celebdil, and it was she who nursed him back to health,\ndressing him in white, symbolizing his status as the new leader of the\norder. \n\nLater, she sent word to Aragorn about the Paths of the Dead, and\nmessages to the Rangers of the North asking for their aid in the War. As\nSauron put forth all his power during the end of the War of the Ring, he\nwas aware of the threat of the Elves and their ancient potency, so he\nsent armies to besiege many of their settlements in the North while\nsimultaneously assailing the major cities of Men and Dwarves. Lórien\nitself was assaulted three times, but the armies of Dol Guldur were\ndriven back due to the courage of the Elves and the power of Galadriel's\nRing.\n\n\n\nIt is said that the power of her Ring could not be overcome unless\nSauron himself would come to do battle. After the fall of Sauron she,\nwith Thranduil of Mirkwood and their elven allies, crossed the Anduin\ninto Dol Guldur, where they tore down its walls and laid bare its pits.\nShe then traveled to Minas Tirith for the wedding of King Aragorn and\nLady Arwen, and continued living in Lórien until TA 3021 when she\ntraveled to the Grey Havens and, with the remaining Ring-bearers, took a\nship and returned at last to the Undying Lands whence she had come so\nlong ago.\n\n\nCharacter\n\n\n\n_The Lady Galadriel - “Lady of Light” - grandmother of Lady Arwen, is an\nElven Queen of extraordinary beauty, with her timeless features and\ngolden river of hair._\n\nGaladriel was highly praised for her beauty, particularly that of her\nhair, which was a deep and radiant gold, shot with silver. It was said\nby the elves of Tirion to have ensnared the light of the two trees,\nTelperion and Laurelin, and possibly to have inspired the creation of\nthe Silmarils by Fëanor. She was also the tallest of elf-women, standing\nat around 6 feet 4 inches, or 193 centimeters. Because of her wisdom and\npower, she had very important roles throughout the history of\nMiddle-earth, especially during her time in Eregion and during the War\nof the Ring. She had a penchant for dressing in the purest white.\nShe was known, especially in her younger days, as being quite prideful.\nHowever, by the end of the Third Age, that pride had been tempered a\ngreat deal by age.\n\nRegarding her decision to remain in Middle-earth, a passage says:\n\n\nPowers\n\n_She is, however, no mere fey being, but a lady of great power. She\nbears one of the Great Rings - Nenya - the Ring of Adamant, and with the\nOne Ring in her grasp as well, she would be a mighty match for the Dark\nLord Sauron._\n\nGaladriel possessed a tremendous amount of magical powers, and was said\nto be the greatest of the Ñoldor after Fëanor.\n\nWhen she still lived in the Undying Lands, she had been a pupil of\nYavanna and Aulë, and she later became a friend of Melian the Maia.\nHence, it can be deduced that she had learned her powers from these\nthree illustrious personages, though the nature of her magic is still\nnot well-understood.\n\nThe vast majority of Galadriel's powers stemmed from the legendary\nartifact she controlled: Nenya, the Ring of Water. In some tales, she\nwas also depicted with the powers of communicating over vast distances,\npredicting the future, and even cloaking her mind from other\ntremendously powerful beings (she once stated that Sauron could not\nperceive her mind, though she could perceive his). It is also possible\nthat her powers of divination were either derived from or accentuated by\nher mirror, which could reveal events of the past, present, and future.\n\nHowever, due to her incredibly enigmatic nature, even the immensely\nskillful Saruman and an Elf as perceptive as Elrond found it difficult\nto understand her powers, and they were such to bring doubt to the minds\nof the non-Elven inhabitants of Middle-earth. Whatever they might have\nbeen, it must still be noted that Galadriel had used them for good:\nprotecting Lórien from any attack (it was said that only Sauron himself\ncould have overcome this protection), and destroying Dol Guldur (a\nfortress whose power was multiplied by Sauron's magic). Last but not\nleast, Galadriel was also skilled in ósanwe (the ability to communicate\nwith others through thoughts): after the destruction of the One Ring,\nGaladriel communicated mentally with Elrond and Gandalf on their return\njourney from Minas Tirith.\n\nBesides her magical powers, Galadriel was also extremely wise and\nintelligent: she was one of the very few who were not fooled by Sauron\nin the Second Age, and therefore suggested to Celebrimbor to hide the\nThree Rings. She also refrained from openly using the powers of Nenya\nwhile the One Ring was in Sauron's possession, and only did so after the\nOne Ring was lost (for it was only then that it was safe enough for her\nto do so). When Frodo offered her the One Ring, Galadriel managed to\nreject the undeniable temptation, for she was wise enough to know that,\nthough she might start off with good intentions with the One Ring in her\npossession, she would only become a tyrant as terrible as Sauron in the\nend. This could be viewed as a testament to her excellent understanding\nof the seductive nature of power, as well as her awareness of her own\npersonal limitations.\n\n\nTrivia\n\n-   Galadriel is the last child of Finarfin, and additionally, the last\n    remaining grandchild of Finwë (with the possible exception of\n    Maglor).\n\n\nEtymology\n\n''Galadriel ''was originally named ARTANIS (“noble woman”) which was her\nFather-name and NERWEN (“man-maiden”), which was her Mother-name\n(referring to her height and strength). _Galadriel_ is the Sindarinized\nversion of Telerin Quenya ALATÁRIEL, the name given to her by her lover\nCeleborn, meaning “maiden crowned with a garland of bright radiance”,\nwhich referred to her hair.\n\nThe name GALADHRIEL was used outside Lórien by the people who did not\nknow the ancient days and Galadriel's history, confusing her name with\nthe Elvish word _galadh_ (“tree”) and the name of the Galadhrim, the\npeople of Lórien.\n\nNames and Titles\n\nShe is referred to as THE LADY OF LÓRIEN, LADY OF LIGHT, THE LADY OF THE\nGALADHRIM, or THE LADY OF THE WOOD interchangeably. Within the realm of\nLothlórien, she was referred to as simply LADY GALADRIEL or THE LADY.\n\nWhen she and Celeborn were being referred to collectively, they were\nknown as THE LORD AND LADY.\n\n\nAppearances in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)_\n-   _The Return of the King (novel)_\n-   _The Silmarillion: Quenta Silmarillion_\n-   _Unfinished Tales: The History of Galadriel and Celeborn_\n-   _The Hobbit (novel)_\n\nIn the movies\n\n-   _An Unexpected Journey_\n-   _The Desolation of Smaug_\n-   _The Battle of the Five Armies_\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nBakshi's _Lord of the Rings_\n\n\n\nIn Ralph Bakshi's 1978 _Lord of the Rings_, Galadriel is voiced by\nScottish character actress Annette Crosbie.\n\n_Lord of the Rings_ film trilogy\n\nGaladriel is portrayed by Cate Blanchett in Peter Jackson's film\ntrilogy. She appears in all three films as a supporting character.  Galadriel narrates the\nopening prologue to _The Fellowship of the Ring_, describing the War of\nthe Ring and the initial defeat of Sauron. She is shown receiving one of\nthe elven Rings of Power. Galadriel appears in person later when the\nFellowship arrive in Lórien, greeting them alongside her husband\nCeleborn. She speaks telepathically with Frodo and leads him to her\nmirror, in which he sees a vision of Sauron's victory. Galadriel warns\nFrodo that Boromir will try and take the One Ring, upon which Frodo\noffers The Ring to her. In that moment, Galadriel herself is tempted by\nthe Ring, but she is able to overcome the temptation and “pass the\ntest.” She gives Frodo a phial of light when the Fellowship departs\nLothlórien.  In the\nextended edition, Galadriel and Celeborn give the other members of the\nFellowship various gifts as well. Besides Frodo and Sam, she gave Merry\nand Pippin an Elven dagger, Aragorn a curved Elvish hunting knife,\nLegolas a Bow of the Galadhrim and three strands of Galadriel's hair was\ngiven to Gimli.\n\nIn _The Two Towers_, Galadriel appears in a single scene, warning Elrond\ntelepathically that the One Ring is tempting Faramir. She then urges him\nto send aid to the people of Rohan at Helm's Deep. Strangely, the elves\nthat do arrive at Helm's Deep under Haldir are from Lothlórien, not\nRivendell. Although there is mention of _osanwe_ (“thought speech”) in\nTolkien's writings, Galadriel's scenes from _The Two Towers_ have no\ndirect counterparts in the novels.\n\nIn _The Return of the King_, Galadriel appears in a vision to Frodo near\nCirith Ungol, urging him to continue his quest. She also appears at the\nvery end of the film alongside Elrond and Celeborn at the Grey Havens.\nShe departs with them, Gandalf, Frodo, and Bilbo to Valinor.\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\n\n\nGaladriel's role in Jackson's _The Hobbit_ film trilogy is entirely\ninvented for the adaptation, as she does not appear in the original\nnovel. She appears in all three films as a supporting character.\n\nGaladriel first appears in _An Unexpected Journey_ at a meeting of the\nWhite Council alongside Elrond, Gandalf, and Saruman. She believes\nGandalf when he claims that the Necromancer is becoming a bigger threat\nand that something must be done with Dol Guldur.\n\nIn _The Desolation of Smaug_, Galadriel telepathically encourages\nGandalf to investigate the tombs of the Nine in the High Fells and to\nconfront the Necromancer.\n\n\n\nIn _The Battle of the Five Armies_, Galadriel rescues Gandalf from Dol\nGuldur. Initially, it seems that she has come alone; she defeats an orc\nwith a blast of magic from Nenya. However, she is quickly cornered by\nthe spectral forms of the _Nazgûl_ as the disembodied voice of Sauron\nbegins taunting her in the Black Speech. The Dark Lord mocks the Elf\nQueen for being alone in the shadow, a singular light in the dark.\n\nHowever, Galadriel reveals that Saruman and Elrond have accompanied her\nto Dol Guldur, and the two battle the Ringwraiths while Galadriel\nattempts to heal Gandalf with a kiss, an action which drains her energy.\nRadagast arrives to take Gandalf away, and Galadriel resists Gandalf's\nplea to have her join him. After the Ringwraiths are defeated, Sauron\nhimself manifests and restores the Nazgûl as he bears down on the White\nCouncil, threatening them with the fall of the East and the rise of\nAngmar. While Saruman and Elrond recoil in horror in the presence of the\nDark Lord, Galadriel rises in her darker ethereal form to challenge\nSauron with the Light of Eärendil.\n\nShe easily overpowers the Nazgûl and casts them away as her and Sauron\nengage in a duel of wills with the latter trying to assert his power.\nGaladriel, however, proves herself unyielding and declares Sauron as\n“Nameless, Faceless, and Formless” and demands that he returns to the\nVoid form whence he came. Ultimately Galadriel overpowers Sauron, who is\nflung into the East as an orb of fire. The encounter saps Galadriel's\nenergy, however, and Saruman instructs her to retreat to Lórien while he\npromises to handle the threat of Sauron himself.\n\nRadio series\n\nGaladriel was voiced by Marian Diamond in the BBC's The Lord of the\nRings (1981 radio series).\n\nVideo games\n\n-   In _The Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle-earth_, Galadriel\n    appears as one of the ring heroes, making her one of the two most\n    powerful units in the game. She has the appearance of her corrupted\n    image in Jackson´s films. She fights using magic which can swipe\n    dozens of units in a single hit. Her power was to summon a tornado\n    as the one she used to destroy Dol Guldur. (_See Galadriel at The\n    Wiki for Middle-earth_)\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Galadriel also appears in _The Lord of the Rings Online_, at Caras\n    Galadhon.\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThe name _Galadriel_ has moved outside of Tolkien's work and into the\nwider world; parents occasionally give it to their daughters, and at\nleast one high-end shop has adopted it as their own. The Led Zeppelin\nsongs'' Stairway to Heaven'' and _The Battle of Evermore_ contain many\nreferences to Galadriel. The band Barclay James Harvest also wrote a\nsong named “_Galadriel_.” Galadriel was the given name of the main\ncharacter in the Katherine Paterson novel _The Great Gilly Hopkins_. In\nthe novel Panic, there are a group of computer hackers known simply as\nGaladriel Jones and the elves. Since _Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_ was\nreleased, the elven names of Galadriel and Legolas, and Elrond were\noften used by fans to name their characters."

    "text": "SAMWISE GAMGEE, known as SAM, was a Hobbit of the Shire. He was Frodo\nBaggins' gardener and best friend. Sam proved himself to be Frodo's\nclosest and most dependable companion, the most loyal of the Fellowship\nof the Ring, and also played a necessary role in protecting Frodo and\ndestroying the One Ring.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\n\n\nSam was the youngest son of Hamfast and Bell Gamgee, and had many\nbrothers and sisters. A gardener by trade, Sam seemed to be a simple\nHobbit of plain speech. However, his love for Elves, his gift for\npoetry, and his belief that the world contains greater wonders than most\nhobbits were aware of (all nurtured by his tutor Bilbo Baggins) set him\napart from the beginning. It was Sam who first introduced (in Tolkien's\nnovels) the theme of the Elves sailing from Middle-earth, a subtle\nforeshadowing of Bilbo and Frodo's final journey across the sea from the\nGrey Havens. He lived with his father, Hamfast Gamgee, known as “The\nGaffer”, on Bagshot Row in the Shire, close to Bag End. Sam's mother was\nBell Goodchild. He had five siblings: Hamson, Halfred, Daisy, May, and\nMarigold.\n\n\n\nQuest of the Ring\n\nAs “punishment” for eavesdropping on Gandalf's conversation with Frodo\nregarding the dangers of the One Ring, Gandalf chose Sam be Frodo's\ncompanion on his journey to Rivendell. Sam saved Frodo's life more than\nonce during the quest to destroy the Ring, and accompanied him all the\nway to Mount Doom.\n\nAfter Shelob attacked and seemingly killed Frodo, Sam took the Ring,\nintending to complete the quest on his own. Because he held the Ring for\na time, he was considered one of the Ring-bearers and during the time he\npossessed it the Ring tempted him with visions of a great garden all for\nhimself. Being humble, Sam never gave into the treacherous visions and\ntemptations of the Ring, and returned it when he discovered Frodo alive\nin the Tower of Cirith Ungol. He and Bilbo were the only ones ever to\nhave given up the ring willingly, and only Sam surrendered it readily.\n\nWhen Orcs took Frodo's body, Sam overheard one of them saying that Frodo\nwas still alive, so he followed the Orcs into the Tower of Cirith Ungol,\ndetermined to rescue Frodo. Once there he found that competing bands of\nUruks and Morgul Orcs had rioted and killed one another over the\npossession of Frodo's Mithril coat, thus making it easier for Sam to get\nto Frodo and escape the tower with him. \n\nSam and Frodo made their way to Mount Doom, disguised as Orcs along the\nway. The way to Mount Doom was filled with fiery rocks and pillows of\nash which made it almost impossible for the hobbits to pass. When Frodo\ncollapsed from weakness, Sam carried him up the slopes of Mount Doom,\nonly to be stopped by Gollum. Sam delayed Gollum while Frodo walked on\nto the volcano. As Sam, following Frodo, reached and entered the door of\nthe Sammath Naur he didn't notice Gollum following behind. Sam yelled\nfor Frodo to destroy the Ring, but Frodo was overcome by its power and\nclaimed the Ring for himself, putting it on his finger and disappearing\nfrom Sam's sight. Just then Gollum attacked Sam, who fell and hit his\nhead on a rock, temporarily knocking him unconscious. When he came to he\nsaw Gollum fighting with an unseen foe (Frodo, having put on the Ring).\nThen Gollum bit off Frodo's finger, Ring and all, and was reunited with\nhis treasure for a short time, until dancing with joy he toppled off the\nbrink and fell into the depths, destroying the One Ring, and him dying\nin the process with it.\n\nThe two hobbits managed to escape the crumbling mountain, just as the\nvolcano erupted, only to be left helpless atop the remains of giant\nrock,engulfed in a sea of lava . As their demise approached, Sam\nconfessed his love for the beautiful hobbit, Rosie Cotton, a fellow\nresident of Hobbiton, that he dreamed of one day marrying. Sam and Frodo\neventually collapsed from exhaustion, but were spotted by Gwaihir the\nLord of Eagles and with his Eagle companions. Landroval and Meneldor\nrescued Sam and Frodo and flew them to the safety of Minas Tirith.\n\n\n\nAfter recovering from their strenuous and substantial injuries Frodo and\nSam were greeted by the rest of The Fellowship, who praised the two\nHalfling's for completing their mission. Sam and the rest of the\nhobbits, remained in Gondor to bear witness to Aragorn's Coronation\nCeremony. Many of Middle Earth's esteemed leaders and famed warriors\nwere in attendance as the new King of Gondor was crowned. Aragorn,\ngreeted many of the brave souls who had helped the Fellowship on their\njourney's, but non more so than the four brave hobbits who stood before\nhim. Aragorn and the rest of the city, bowed to the four halflings, in\nadmiration for thier brave acts that ensured the safety of all\nMiddle-earth.\n\nWith the threat of Sauron's return vanquished and the One Ring\ndestroyed, the four hobbits returned to the Shire, where they settled in\nonce again.\n\n\n\nAfter the War of the Ring\n\nAfter the War of the Ring and the end of the Third Age, Sam married Rose\n(Rosie) Cotton. They had thirteen children: Elanor the Fair, Frodo,\nRose, Merry, Pippin, Goldilocks, Hamfast, Daisy, Primrose, Bilbo, Ruby,\nRobin, and Tolman. When Frodo Baggins announced that he was leaving to\nthe Undying Lands, west of Middle-earth, he gave Sam the Red Book of\nWestmarch and the household of Bag End where he and his large personal\nfamily later called the Gardners would live for many years. After Will\nWhitfoot resigned his post as Mayor of Michel Delving, in SR 1427, Sam\nwas elected Mayor of the Shire for seven consecutive 7-year terms.\n\n\n\n\n\nLater years\n\nAfter his wife died in the year 61 of the Fourth Age (SR 1482), Sam\nentrusted the Red Book to his daughter, Elanor and left the Shire. It is\na tradition handed down from Elanor that he went to the Grey Havens, and\nbecause he was also a Ring-bearer (albeit for a short time), he was\nallowed to pass over the Sea to be reunited with Frodo in the Undying\nLands.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nTolkien took the name from Gamgee Tissue, a surgical dressing invented\nby a 19th century Birmingham surgeon called Joseph Sampson Gamgee.\n“Gamgee” became the colloquial name in Birmingham for cotton wool;\nTolkien described why he had chosen that name for his character:\n\nIt is possible that Tolkien may have subconsciously recalled Dr. Gamgee\n(who died in 1886 but is commemorated by a plaque at the Birmingham\nMedical Institute, only yards from Tolkien's childhood home) but he\nclaimed to be genuinely surprised when, in March 1956, he received a\nletter from one Sam Gamgee, who had heard that his name was in _The Lord\nof the Rings_ but had not read the book. Tolkien replied on March 18:\n\n\n\nHe proceeded to send Mr. Gamgee a signed copy of all three volumes of\nthe book. However, the incident sparked a nagging worry in Tolkien's\nmind, as he recorded in his journal:\n\nIn the Appendix F of _The Lord of the Rings_, Tolkien tells us that the\nWestron form of Sam's name is BANAZÎR GALBASI (_also spelled Galpsi_).\n_Banazîr_ comes from elements meaning “halfwise” or “simple”; Tolkien\nreplaced it with _Samwise,_ a modernization of the ancient English\n_samwís_ which corresponds closely in meaning. _Galbasi_ comes from the\nname of the village _Galabas_. The name _Galabas_ uses the elements\n_galab-_, meaning “game”, and _bas-_, corresponding somewhat to “-wich”\nor “-wick”. Tolkien's English translation, _Samwís Gamwich_, could have\ncome to _Samwise Gamgee_ in modern English. Sam is also known as Perhael\nin Sindarin.\n\n\nCommentary\n\nMany regard Sam Gamgee as the “true hero” of Tolkien's story. Tolkien\nhimself expressed this view in one of his letters: Sam was referred to\nas the “chief hero”, and special emphasis is placed on Sam's “rustic\nlove” for Rosie. The quest to destroy the Ring would not have succeeded\nwithout Sam, who repeatedly saves Frodo from disaster (such as rescuing\nhim at Cirith Ungol and carrying him up Mount Doom).\n\nThe relationship between Frodo and Sam was, in many respects, at the\ncentre of _The Lord of the Rings_. To the modern reader, it seems\narchaic - it is clearly extremely class-oriented: Sam's humbleness and\n“plain speaking” is frequently emphasized in contrast to Frodo's\n“gentility”, and he often shows deference to Frodo, calling him “Mister\nFrodo”. At the same time, a strong bond of love and trust grows between\nthem, portrayed most poignantly during the events of Cirith Ungol, where\nSam vows to return to his (apparently) dead master, to be reunited with\nFrodo in death.\n\nTolkienologists regard Sam as Frodo's batman. In the British Army, a\nbatman was an orderly who acted as the personal servant of an officer.\nIt was a role with which Tolkien (who served as an Army officer in the\nFirst World War) would have been extremely familiar. Sam undertakes all\nof the typical roles of a batman - he runs errands for Frodo, he cooks,\nhe transports him (or at least carries him), and he carries his luggage.\nTolkien confirmed this interpretation when he wrote in a private letter\nthat:\n\nCompare with the relationship between Don Quixote and his squire Sancho\nPanza, and the gradual “Quixotization” of Sancho. Jim Butcher also\ndescribes Samwise in his book _Changes:_\n\n\nAppearances\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n\nIn the movies\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n\n\n\n\nPortrayals in adaptations\n\nRoddy McDowall voiced the character of Samwise Gamgee in the 1980\nanimated short of _The Return of the King_, made directly for\ntelevision. In the more popular animated version, originally released in\n1978, Michael Scholes voiced the character.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film trilogy\n\n\n\nIn the Peter Jackson movies _The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of\nthe Ring_ (2001), _The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers_ (2002) and\n_The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_ (2003), Sam was played\nby Sean Astin. It is not clear whether Astin had heard Nighy's radio\nperformance, but both actors bring very similar characterizations and\naccents to the role.\n\nRadio\n\nIn the 1981 BBC radio, serial of _The Lord of the Rings_, Sam was played\nby William Nighy.\n\nVideo Games\n\n-   Sam appeared as a playable character in the action adventure video\n    games _The Two Towers (2002)_ and _The Return of the King_ (2003)\n    both games follow Peter Jackson's Rings Movie Trilogy and the games\n    were made by New Line Cinema (owned by Warner Bros.) published by EA\n    Games and licensed by various companies such as Nintendo, Microsoft\n    and Sony. Each RingsTrilogy actor reprised their original role and\n    added voice to the character in the game. Sean Astin reprises his\n    role of Samwise Gamgee from the films for the video game.\n-   Sam appeared once again in the video game _The Lord of the Rings:\n    Aragorn's Quest_ but as the narrator of the story of the War of the\n    Third Age as Sam is telling the story to his children after Frodo\n    left Middle-Earth. Sean Astin once again reprises his role as\n    Samwise Gamgee\n\n\nWeapons\n\nSword\n\nSam uses a short Barrow-blade for melee combat in books, movies and\nvideo games, but for a time after Frodo was attacked by Shelob and sent\nto the Tower of Cirith Ungol, Sam used Frodo's sword Sting to rescue him\nand more.\n\nFrying pan\n\n\n\nSam uses his frying pan in Balin's Tomb as a weapon alongside his\nBarrow-blade.\n\nThrowing weapons\n\nSam can use rocks to hit opponents from a distance, however that is not\ntheir only purpose in the book (Frodo). In The Lord of the Rings: The\nReturn of the King (video game), he uses throwing knives instead of\nrocks."

    "text": "GAMLING was a Man of Rohan sometimes known as “GAMLING THE OLD”\nreferenced in The Two Towers and the Return of the King.\n\n\nBiography\n\nGamling was from the Westfold and he understood the language of Dunland.\nGamling is left in charge of the forces defending Helm's Dike (a\nfortification across the Deeping-coomb before the stronghold of\nthe Hornburg defending Helm's Deep) by command of Erkenbrand.\n\nKing Théoden of Rohan arrives at Helm's Deep with reinforcements\nfrom Edoras on March 3, 3019. As the forces of Isengard approach,\nGamling and his men pull back from Helm's Dike and enter the stronghold\nof the Hornburg. Gamling hears Gimli's warning that Orcs have entered a\nculvert under the wall and leads the Men of the Westfold in a charge\nthat drives them back.\n\nGamling then asks Gimli to help block up the opening with small boulders\nand broken stones with the remark, “We must stop this\nrat-hole. Dwarves are said to be cunning folk with stone. Lend us your\naid, master!” However, Saruman's forces later breach the Deeping Wall\nusing an explosive device. Gamling retreats into the Deep with Gimli.\nThere they defend the narrows before the entrance to the Glittering\nCaves until dawn, when Gandalf and Eomer arrive with reinforcements, and\nthe Battle of the Hornburg is won.\n\nHe is later mentioned by Theoden prior to the Charge of Pelennor Fields,\nwhere Gamling is told by Theoden to “Follow the king's banner down the\ncentre.” He is seen shooting arrows into the stomach of a Mumakil from\nbeneath it while riding on horseback, but he is not seen after the\nbattle, and it is assumed he was killed.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_GAMLING_ roughly means “Old one” in Swedish, Icelandic, Danish, and\nNorwegian.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film trilogy\n\nIn Peter Jackson's _The Two Towers_ and _The Return of the King_,\nGamling is portrayed by the New Zealand actor, Bruce Hopkins. He\nserves as the main lieutenant to King Théoden, also perhaps his\nbodyguard, and plays quite a major role in organizing the defenses of\nHelm's Deep, as in the Book. Gamling, unlike in the Book, does not aid\nthe entrance to the Glittering Caves, as such, but instead rides out\nwith the remaining defenders towards the main Orc army outside.\n\nGamling again appears in the Return of the King, and rides to Dunharrow\nwith the other Rohirrim, but shows doubts towards Aragorn, Legolas and\nGimli leaving towards the lair of the Army of the Dead, instead of\nstaying with the people of Rohan to fight. Gamling is present at the\nBattle of the Pelennor Fields, where he can be seen firing arrows at\nvarious Mûmakil, and slaying one. Gamling dies during the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields.\n\nIn the films, Gamling's role is greatly expanded actually appears to be\na mesh of several different characters from the books. In the books he\nonly appears as the captain of the permanent garrison of men located at\nHelm's Deep and in this role he likely answered to Théodred, the\nSecond Marshall before his death and later to Erkenbrand. In the films\nhe first appears in Meduseld, apparently either second in command to\nHama the door warden, or a replacement of Déorwine, the captain of\nThéoden's knights._The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers_ (2002)\n\nDuring the third film he is shown to be one of the three main captains\nof Rohan during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, appearing replacing\nElfhelm. He is also appears to replace Guthláf the banner-bearer who in\nthe books used a great horn to signal the charge of the Rohirrim. In the\nfilm, Gamling is seen to do this at the start of the battle and later\nwhen Théoden ordered a charge against the Mumakil.\n\nGamling is not seen again so it is unknown whether if he survived The\nBattle of the Pelennor Fields or not.\n\nGamling was in the _The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)_ where he\nwas voiced by Patrick Barrin.\n\nVideo Games\n\n\n\nGamling makes an appearance in _The Lord of the Rings Online_ and _LEGO\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Video Game_. He is also a playable character,\nand can be purchased in Fangorn Forest along with Grishnákh. For an\nunknown reason, his hair is in white instead of blond like in the movie."

    "race": "Elf",
    "text": "GIL-GALAD, originally named EREINION, was a Ñoldorin Elf, son of Fingon\n. He was the last High King of the Ñoldor in Middle-earth, and bore\nmany titles, including HIGH KING OF THE ELVES OF THE WEST, King of the\nEldar, King of Lindon, Lord of the High Elves, and the Lord of Eriador.\n\nGil-galad held the highest authority among the Elves he ruled and was\nrespected by both the Ñoldor and the Sindar. He was considered the High\nKing of the Elves in Middle-earth. He formed the Last Alliance of Elves\nand Men with Elendil, and led the Elves to war against Sauron during\nthis time. His death marked the end of the Ñoldorin Kingdoms in\nMiddle-earth, though many Ñoldor would still dwell in Imladris later\nthroughout the Third Age.\n\n\nBiography\n\nFirst Age\n\nGil-galad was most likely born in the fifth century of the First Age,\nand was still young during the times of the battles of the Dagor\nBragollach and Nirnaeth Arnoediad. He was the son of Fingon, tying him\ninto the House of Fingolfin. He lived in Nargothrond until its fall and\nescaped, and eventually came to the Mouths of Sirion.\n\nAfter the death of Turgon during the Fall of Gondolin, Gil-galad\nreceived the Kingship of the Ñoldor. When the Sons of Feanor\ncommitted the Third Kinslaying, Gil-galad received word of the sacking\nof the Havens, but he and his host arrived too late to stop the Sons of\nFeanor, who fled after the battle was over. However the survivors of\nSirion joined with Gil-galad and went with him to Balar, where they told\nhim of Elrond and Elros' captivity. After the War of Wrath, the\nremaining Sons of Feanor vanished out of history. Maedhros committed\nsuicide while Maglor disappeared without a trace, leaving Elrond and\nElros alone. Therefore at some point Gil-galad welcomed Elrond into his\nranks, after the latter chose to be one of Elf Kind.\n\nSecond Age\n\n\n\nIn year 1 of the Second Age, Gil-galad remained in Middle-earth and\nestablished Lindon, which was strong and secure against its enemies. At\nits height, his realm extended eastward as far as the Misty Mountains\nand the western parts of Greenwood the Great, though most of the Eldar\nremained in Lindon and in Elrond's refuge of Rivendell.\n\nGil-galad had an alliance with the Men of Westernesse, especially with\nTar-Aldarion (the Mariner), The Faithful and Elendil. Gil-galad reigned\nas High King of the Ñoldor throughout the Second Age. During this time\nGil-galad was given the seeds of mellyrn, or mallorn, trees by\nTar-Aldarion, who was, during this time, High King of Numenor. But the\nseeds wouldn't grow in his land so he gave them to Galadriel before she\nleft Lindon. She carried these seeds for a long time, finally planting\nthem in Lindórinand. When they grew in the land, it was renamed\nLothlórien, Lórien of Blossom. At some point, Gil-galad and Elrond were\napproached by a stranger called Annatar, who called himself the Lord of\nGifts. Fair seeming were his words and offerings, but Gil-galad\nperceived that this Annatar was not what he seemed. Therefore he refused\nto have dealings with him, and sent word abroad to all the Elves that\nthey should shun this stranger.\n\nHowever Annatar was received in Eregion, where he taught the Elves how\nto make the Rings of Power. But Gil-galad's distrust was proven correct,\nas Annatar was Sauron in disguise, and the rings were tools for his\nwicked plans to dominate Middle-earth. Later on, Gil-galad was entrusted\nby Celebrimbor with the Elven Rings Vilya (Ring of Air) and Narya (Ring\nof Fire), two of the Three Rings, which he passed on to his herald\nElrond and his lieutenant Cirdan prior to his demise at the Siege of\nBarad-dûr.\n\nFor a long time Gil-galad waged war with Sauron. But the High King was\naided by the Numenoreans, then ruled by Tar-Minastir, which hindered\nSauron's forces. Sauron, who barely escaped with a bodyguard, returned\nto Mordor, where he laid low, gathering his strength, plotting vengeance\nagainst the Dunedain. He was later confronted by the Numenoreans and\nbrought back as a prisoner to their homeland, leaving Gil-galad free to\nrule Middle-Earth in peace. In Sauron's absence, Gil-galad's power grew\nto the point where Sauron was dismayed when he returned from the ruin of\nNumenor. Yet the survivors of Numenor, known as the Faithful, arrived in\nMiddle-Earth and established their kingdoms. They retained their\nfriendship with the Elves, and both Elendil and Gil-galad took counsel\nas to how they should deal with Saruon. At length they decided to gather\nall of their hosts and attack Sauron before he could recover his\nstrength.\n\nWith the emergence of Sauron, Gil-galad joined forces with the King\nElendil to defeat the might of Mordor, reborn again with the return of\nSauron. Their large, well-trained, united forces engaged Sauron's armies\nmultiple times in the conflict known as the War of the Last Alliance.\nGil-galad's famed weapon was a spear named Aeglos - which meant\n“Icicle”; none could withstand it. Finally, towards the end of the war,\nthe Elves and Men passed through into Mordor and laid siege to\nBarad-dûr, where Gil-galad and Elendil dueled Sauron himself. During\ntheir struggle, Gil-galad and Elendil inflicted enough mortal wounds on\nthe Dark Lord to destroy his body, though they received terrible wounds\nin return. This sacrifice allowed Isildur to sever the Ring from the\nDark Lord's hand. But Gil-galad received severe burns from “the heat of\nSauron's hand”, and so he passed on to the Halls of Mandos. He was not\nknown to have a wife, nor any children, so the kingship of the Ñoldor\nended in Middle-earth and Círdan was from then on the Lord of the Grey\nHavens and Lindon.\n\n Gil-galad was an Elven-king. Of him the harpers sadly sing; the last\nwhose realm was fair and free between the Mountains and the Sea.\n\nHis sword was long, his lance was keen. His shining helm afar was seen;\nthe countless stars of heaven's field were mirrored in his silver\nshield.\n\nBut long ago he rode away, and where he dwelleth none can say; for into\ndarkness fell his star in Mordor where the shadows are.\n\n    ― From _The Fall of Gil-galad_, as translated by Bilbo Baggins\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_GIL-GALAD_ was a Sindarin word that means “Star of Radiance” , from\n_gil_ (“star”) and _galad_ (“light, radiance”).\n\nHis name in Quenya was _ARTANÁRO_ which means “High Flame”. In Sindarin,\n_Artanáro_ translates to _Rodnor_.\n\nIt was first conceived that Gil-galad's birth name was _EREINION_\ninstead of his epessë. _Ereinion_ means “Son of Kings”, from _erain_\n(“kings”) and _ion_ (“son”).\n\n\nParentage\n\nGil-galad's parentage had many versions in Tolkien's legendarium:\n\n-   Gil-galad was originally, and briefly, conceived as a descendant of\n    Fëanor.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   In both _The Silmarillion_ and _Unfinished Tales_, he was the son of\n    Fingon.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   In some notes in _The History of Middle-earth_, it is stated that he\n    had briefly been the son of Finrod Felagund. It was said that\n    Felagund sent his wife and son away for the Falas for their safety.\n    In this version, Galadriel was Gil-galad's sister and daughter of\n    Felagund. However, Tolkien decided that Felagund was unmarried\n    and childless.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   In another, Angrod had a son Artaresto (later called Orodreth) whom\n    Finrod made his steward and succeeded in Nargothrond. His wife was a\n    Sindarin lady of the North, and had two children, Finduilas and\n    Gil-galad, whom she called Rodnor.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   In the last, the name _Artaresto_ was replaced by _Arothir_\n    (Orodreth), which was the name of the nephew of Finrod and father of\n    Gil-galad. Finduilas remained as Orodreth's daughter and became\n    sister of Gil-galad.\n\n\n\nA marginal note by Tolkien from around this time (the late 1950s)\nsuggested that Gil-galad might have been the son of Fingon. This\nsuggestion was taken up by Tolkien's son and literary executor\nChristopher Tolkien in the published version of _The Silmarillion_,\nwhich states that Gil-galad is the son of Fingon. After the Dagor\nBragollach and the ruin of Beleriand which resulted in the death of his\ngrandfather Fingolfin, then High King of the Noldor, Fingon becomes the\nHigh King and sends a young Gil-galad to the Havens of the Falas under\nCírdan. This idea of Gil-galad being sent to the Havens was derived\nfrom material which the elder Tolkien had written at the time when he\nsaw Gil-galad as the son of Finrod.\n\nAfter the disaster of the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the title passes to\nFingon's brother Turgon. Morgoth assaults the Falathrim in great force\nafter that battle but Círdan and Gil-galad manage to flee in their ships\nto the Isle of Balar. When tidings come to Balar about the sack of\nGondolin and the death of Turgon, Gil-galad becomes the King.\nGil-galad's name in the chapter “Aldarion and Erendis” in _Unfinished\nTales_ was also changed by the younger Tolkien in order to keep\nconsistency with the published version of _The Silmarillion_. — in the\noriginal version of that work he was noted as a son of Finrod.\nChristopher later stated in _The Peoples of Middle-earth_ that this\ndecision to make Gil-galad a son of Fingon was an editorial mistake on\nhis part, and did not represent his father's conception of the\ncharacter. He suggested that it would have been better to have left\nGil-galad's parentage obscure.\n\nTolkien's final decision for Gil-galad's parentage appears to have been\nthat he was a son of Orodreth, who was at the same time changed from\nbeing a son of Finarfin to a son of Angrod. This conception, however,\nwas never incorporated into the written stories of _The Silmarillion_,\nand aspects of it — notably the downgrading of Orodreth into a son of\nAngrod — would have required considerable reworking of the existing\ntext. Moreover, if Gil-galad were the son of Orodreth then he would not\nhave been High King, as the kingship belonged to the House of Fingolfin.\nIn the official text of _The Silmarillion_, Gil-galad receives the\nkingship as he is the son of Fingon, who in turn is the son of\nFingolfin.\n\n\nAppearances in the books and films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Silmarillion_\n-   _Unfinished Tales_\n-   ''History of Middle-earth ''\n-   ''The Fellowship of the Ring ''\n\nIn the films\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film trilogy\n\nIn _Fellowship of the Ring,_ Gil-galad's (played by Mark Ferguson) death\nscene was deleted, however he makes a brief appearance when he fights\nmultiple orcs with his spear. He also appears very briefly as one of the\noriginal three Elven ring-bearers (along with Galadriel and Círdan)\nwearing Vilya.\n\nNon-canonical weapons\n\nArmor\n\n\n\nGil-galad's armor was similar in composition to that of all the elves of\nthe Second Age: a cuirass and fault of interlocking lames of steel plate\nover a hauberk of fine mail, together with pauldrons and braces.\nHowever, befitting his status as High-king, his armor was blued and\netched with vine like tracery, and the plates were embossed with Tengwar\nsymbols and included leather pants, which gave greater protection. At\nthe throat, he wore a steel collar that bore his heraldic insignia,\ntwelve stars on a midnight blue field. The color blue may have reflected\nan association with the sea; in any case, it was certainly a dye that\nwas rare on Middle-earth, and it would have required a great deal of\ntime and knowledge to locate enough flora or fauna with which to make\nit. His cloak was of a deep blue and his armor was golden, and instead\nof a helmet, he wore a golden crown, fashioned for him by Celebrimbor,\nwho made the Rings of Power.\n\nShield\n\n\n\nThe shield of the High-king was the same shape as the common Elven\nshield, but like his armor it was more richly adorned: it was enameled\nin blue on and around the center jewel and decorated in gold with the\ntwelve stars of his house. Because Aeglos, his great spear, was wielded\ntwo-handed, it is likely that the shield was carried only to the field\nof battle rather onto it, to be left with one of Gil-galad's attendants.\nIt may have been used by him when he fought with a sword.\n\nVideo games\n\n-   In _Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor_, after Talion finds a certain\n    artifact, the stone from Mount Doom, Celebrimbor will state that he\n    “watched Gil-galad die on the slopes of Mount Doom”. This implies\n    that he watched the battle from the wraith-world, where his soul\n    resides in the game's internal canon. In that game's sequel, Shadow\n    of War, Talion and Celebrimbor will use his spear, likely retrieving\n    it from his resting place.\n-   Gil-galad is a playable character in _LEGO The Lord of the Rings:\n    The Video Game_, and can be obtained by finding him and buying him\n    in a cave in Mordor. He is styled after the movie interpretation of\n    Gil-galad, but his equipment does not include a spear; he instead\n    wields an Elven sword and shield."

    "text": "GILDOR INGLORION was a Ñoldor Elf met by Frodo Baggins in the Shire. On\nSeptember 24, 3018, Gildor and a company of Elves were passing through\nthe Shire, singing as they walked, and without realizing it they caused\na Nazgûl who was seeking Frodo to flee. Gildor recognized Frodo, though\nthey had never met, for he knew Bilbo. He invited Frodo, along with Sam\nGamgee and Pippin Took, to spend the night in the Elves' company.\n\n\nBiography\n\nTo the Hobbits, Gildor and the Elves appeared to shimmer as they walked\nthrough the night. The starlight glimmered in their hair and eyes. They\ncamped in a clearing in the Woody End near Woodhall and the elves\nprovided the Hobbits with bread and fruit and a fragrant drink.\n\n\n\nFrodo stayed up late talking to Gildor. They talked of the many dangers\nthat the Hobbits might soon face. Frodo had greeted Gildor by saying,\n“Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo” (A star shines upon the hour of our\nmeeting) impressed with his knowledge of the ancient tongue and lore he\ncommended Frodo and named him Elf-friend. Gildor perceived that the\nEnemy was seeking for Frodo, though he did not know why. He was\nreluctant to give Frodo any advice in Gandalf's absence.\n\nGildor then advised Frodo to leave quickly and to take with him friends\nhe could trust and to flee from the Nazgûl. He also promised to send out\nword to Elves and others to be on the lookout for Frodo and help him on\nhis journey. Gildor was true to his word, for both Tom Bombadil and\nAragorn heard of Frodo's peril from Gildor. Word also reached Rivendell,\nand Glorfindel rode out to find Aragorn and the Hobbits as they were\npursued by the Nazgûl from Weathertop.\n\nGildor and the Elves continued on their way. Gildor had told Frodo they\nwere tarrying in Middle-earth before heading to the Grey Havens to pass\nover the Sea to the Undying Lands. Where they wandered is not known, but\non September 22, 3021, Gildor and Frodo met once again in the same spot\nin the Woody End where they had met three years earlier. Along with\nElrond, Galadriel and Gandalf, they journeyed to Grey Havens and\ntogether they departed over the Sea into the West.\n\n\nControversy\n\nThe question has arisen of the identity of this character. Gildor calls\nhimself “Gildor Inglorion of the House of Finrod.” He also says: “We are\nExiles, and most of our kindred have long departed and we too are only\ntarrying here a while, ere we return over the Great Sea.” At the time\nwhen _The Lord of the Rings_ was written, Finrod still meant the\ncharacter later known as Finarfin. If we read “House of Finrod” to mean\n“House of Finarfin,” we can place him among the Ñoldor who joined the\nhost of Finarfin during the Exile, and came to Beleriand under Finrod\nFelagund.\n\nSome argue that the name “Inglorion”, which means “Son of Inglor”\nsuggests, that he was in fact the son of Finrod Felagund himself, who\nwas at that time still called Inglor. There is, however, strong evidence\nagainst it.\n\nIn _The Silmarillion_, it is stated that Finrod had no wife, since he\nloved Amarië of the Vanyar, who refused to go with him to the exile.\nThis means that he could only have a son after he died in Middle-earth,\nand went to the Halls of Mandos. He might have been resurrected by\nMandos, and then married Amarië. It is very unlikely (probably\nimpossible), however, that he would be allowed to return to\nMiddle-earth. The only such instance would be Glorfindel, and it is\ndoubtful that if that was the case, there would be no mention of it in\nTolkien's writings. Furthermore, Gildor wouldn't describe himself as one\nof the Exiles.\n\nFurthermore, it is said that there were only two children Idril and\nOrodreth “in the third generation from Finwë to go with the exiles.”\n\nIt should also be noted that Tolkien initially used names from his _The\nSilmarillion_ writings rather at random in _The Hobbit_, and the first\ndrafts of the sequel which would become the _The Lord of the Rings_.\nOther examples are the mention of Gondolin and the appearance of Elrond\nin _The Hobbit,_ which were only later brought into alignment with the\n_The Lord of the Rings_ and the unpublished mythology by a third edition\nof the book. It is likely that after realizing what the work had become\nTolkien would have removed _Inglorion_ as a name of Gildor, just like he\nintended to rename Glorfindel. In the end, neither of these changes\nactually were made.\n\nThis all suggests that, while Gildor might have been initially intended\nto be Felagund's son, in the final version he probably became a member\nof the House of Finrod as one of its servants, not one of its sons\nperhaps one of the knights of Nargothrond, and a son of Inglor; a\ncharacter unconnected to Finrod Felagund."

    "race": "Dwarf",
    "text": "GIMLI, son of Glóin, was a well-respected dwarf warrior in Middle-earth\nduring the Great Years. He was a member of the Fellowship of the Ring,\nand was the only one of the dwarves to readily fight alongside elves in\nthe war against Sauron at the end of the Third Age. After the defeat of\nSauron, he was given lordship of the Glittering Caves at Helm's Deep.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\n\n\nGimli was the son of Glóin and a nephew of Óin, both former companions\nof Bilbo Baggins. He was a remote descendant of Durin the Deathless,\nfather of the first house of dwarven people. Gimli stemmed from, but was\nnot an inheritor of, the royal line. Through his father, Gimli was also\nthe first cousin once removed (or “nephew”, for simplicity's sake) of\nBalin, Lord of Moria, and his brother Dwalin, two more former companions\nof Bilbo. It is also stated in the _Unfinished Tales_ that Gimli was\nprevented from traveling with his father on The Quest of Erebor because\nThorin and company thought him too young, though Gimli, being in his\nsixties, considered himself ripe for adventure and was disappointed to\nbe left behind.\n\nInvolvement with the Ring\n\n\n\nIn the year 3017 of the Third Age, an emissary from Mordor approached\nthe King under the Mountain, Dáin II, with offers of friendship and\nrequests for news of a Hobbit bearing a Ring. Not trusting the\nmessenger, Dáin sent Glóin and Gimli to Rivendell to seek the advice of\nElrond, and to have Bilbo warned that the Enemy was seeking him. As a\nresult, they were summoned to the Council of Elrond, where Elrond\nbelieved they would find the answers to their questions and would be\nable to contribute. Whilst there, Gloin told Elrond of the messenger and\nmade reference to Balin, who had entered Moria and attempted to reclaim\nit. However, he had not sent any word to King Dáin II for five years,\nand Gloin was concerned. The Council ultimately chose to send Frodo\nBaggins to Mordor to destroy the Ring, and decided that a small\nfellowship should go with him. Gimli volunteered to accompany the\nFellowship to Mordor to destroy the One Ring.\n\n\n\nHe volunteered to join the company at least in part because Legolas had\nvolunteered and he doubted the elf's intentions. Gimli journeyed with\nthe fellowship southward along the Misty Mountains. However, the\nFellowship was stymied in their attempt to traverse the pass of\nCaradhras, and were compelled to travel under the mountain rather than\ngo over it. While none in the Fellowship were particularly keen on\npassing thorough Moria, Gimli at least was eager to learn what may have\nhappened to Balin. Unfortunately, while in Moria, Gimli discovered\nBalin's tomb, as well as evidence that virtually all of the Dwarves who\nhad attempted to retake Moria had been slain years prior. After Gandalf\nfell with Durin's Bane from the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, the Fellowship\nentered the Woods of Lothlórien, thus making Gimli the first dwarf to\nenter the Realm since the Balrog was awakened in Moria. However, there\nwas some tension regarding Gimli's being in the Wood, and his Elven\nescorts wished to blindfold him for the journey. Gimli staunchly refused\nuntil Aragorn decided that all in the Fellowship should be blindfolded\nto make the Elven demand more equitable. While in Lorien, he accompanied\nLegolas on many walks through the wooded city, and the two became fast\nfriends. When the fellowship departed, he was given a strand of\nGaladriel's hair, though when he asked for one, he was given three,\nwhich would lead to his name in later years of “Lockbearer”, given to\nhim by Galadriel. When the Fellowship of the Ring fractured, Gimli\naccompanied Aragorn and Legolas in pursuit of Meriadoc Brandybuck and\nPeregrin Took, who had been captured by the forces of Isengard.\n\n\n\n\n\nEventually the three were reunited with Gandalf, and became more\ninvolved with the war. Gimli played a critical role in the defeat of the\nforces of Isengard at Helms Deep, where he was separated from Aragorn\nand Legolas and driven into the caves which he would later become Lord\nof. He fought his way out alongside Eomer when the forces of Isengard\nwere driven from Helm's Deep. His skill with an axe led to his winning,\nby one orc, the friendly contest he and Legolas held over who could kill\nthe most Orcs, despite starting with a disadvantage. Gimli then\naccompanied Aragorn and Legolas through the Dimholt in an attempt to\nrecruit the Army of the Dead. Upon freeing Gondor’s soldiers and\ncapturing the Corsair's ships, the forces under Aragorn, including\nGimli, sailed to Minas Tirith. After being victorious at the Battle of\nthe Pelennor Fields, Gimli accompanied Aragorn and the remainder of the\nGondor and Rohan armies to the Black gates.\n\nLife after the War\n\n\n\nAfter the War, Gimli led a large number of Durin's Folk south to\nestablish a new Dwarf kingdom in the Glittering Caves, which were\nlocated behind Helm's Deep where Gimli was trapped during the battle,\nand he became the first Lord of the Glittering Caves. The Dwarves of the\nGlittering Caves, led by their Lord Gimli, would repair much of the\nphysical damage that was incurred during the War of the Ring. Most\nnotably, they rebuilt the Great Gate of Minas Tirith with a new one made\nof Mithril and steel, as well as improving upon the existing layout of\nthe entire city.\n\nGimli was 139 years old (born in 2879 of the Third Age) when the\nFellowship of the Ring set out from Rivendell, making him 52 years older\nthan Aragorn. His date of death is not known, and according to the _Red\nBook of Westmarch_, he is said to have traveled with Legolas into the\nWest, thus becoming the first dwarf to visit the Undying Lands. Of this\npossibility, Tolkien wrote that it would be strange indeed, that any\nDwarf should be willing to leave Middle-earth for any love, or that the\nEldar should receive him, or that the Lords of the West should permit\nit, but that it is said that Gimli went not only because of his great\nfriendship with Legolas, but also out of desire to see again the beauty\nof Galadriel; and that she, being mighty among the Eldar, may have\nobtained this grace for him.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film trilogy\n\nIn Peter Jackson's films, Gimli accompanies his father, Glóin, and a\ndeputation of Dwarves who had been summoned to the Council of Elrond to\ndiscuss the fate of the One Ring. In this adaptation, he attempts to\ndestroy the Ring by hitting it with his axe, but the axe breaks upon the\nRing and shatters, leaving the Ring unblemished. At the end of the\nCouncil, he volunteers to join the company, in part because Legolas had\njust volunteered, and being an Elf, Gimli doubted his intentions. In his\nsubsequent journey he becomes good friends with Legolas. As the\nFellowship passes through the Misty Mountains, it is Gimli's idea\ninitially to travel through the mines of Moria, whereas in the books it\nwas Gandalf's. Later at the Battle of Helm's Deep, Gimli and Legolas are\nin competition to see who kills the most Uruk-hai. This happens again in\nthe next film, at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.\n\nGimli serves as much of the three films' comic relief in tense moments.\n\nA notable miniature of Gimli sitting on a dead Uruk (from a scene in the\nextended edition of _The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers_) was\nsculpted by Briggite Wuest as a Weta Workshop collectible.\n\nRalph Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings\n\nIn Ralph Bakshi's film, Gimli is a bald-headed dwarf, and was voiced by\nDavid Buck. (_The Lord of the Rings_ (Animated, 1978))\n\nWeapons\n\n\n\nIn the books, Gimli uses one single axe. In Ralph Bakshi's animation\nfilm, he follows the books description (_The Lord of the Rings_\n(Animated, 1978)), while in the trilogy by Peter Jackson, Gimli was\nknown for his skill with the axe, and during the War of the Ring he\nwielded a handful of different types.\n\n-   A bearded axe\n-   Two throwing axes\n-   A battle axe\n-   Double-bladed Axe\n\nMelee axes\n\n\n\nLike most Dwarves, Gimli favoured the axe and carried an assortment of\nvariations of the weapon throughout his travels. At the beginning of his\njourney, Gimil was already equipped with a long handled axe which\ndoubled as a walking stick, to ease the strain of long open walks\nthrough the vast open grasslands of Middle Earth, which was a value to\nthe heavy clad Dwarf. As with most Dwarven Axes, the staff was square\nedged, with tightly wrapped double-cross leather strapping, which kept\nthe axe from slipping through his grasp. The length of this staff gave\nGimli's axe a much longer reach, which combined with his great strength,\nenabled him to hack into enemies at a three foot distance. One of his\naxes was subsequently destroyed in a noble yet failed attempt to destroy\nthe One Ring as the Ring was indestructible to all conventional means. A\nthrowing axe he has was also destroyed, by Gandalf whom Gimli mistook\nfor Saruman and had attacked him. \n\n\n\nDuring the Fellowship's travels through Moria, Gimli was able to\nretrieve a double bladed battle axe which apparently belonged to his\nfather's cousin Balin, Lord of Moria, who had perished during the Goblin\nand Orc attack on Dwarrowdelf. Being double bladed, it allowed Gimli to\nswing it in both directions, without any need to constantly change the\nangle or grip. But it was much heavier, with a shorter staff, which\nmeant it was more suited to close combat, but was compensated by its\ngreat striking power. He is never seen using it during the Return of the\nKing film, as it remains pinned to his cloak. Gimli used all the axes\nmentioned above throughout the War of the Ring. He used them depending\non the battlefield conditions and the types of enemies that he would\nhave to face. No matter what axe, however, Gimli used them all with\ndevastating power in every battle he faced, working in perfect\nconjunction with Aragorn's swordplay and Legolas' skill with the bow.\n\nThrowing axes\n\nIn addition to his melee weapons, Gimli utilized several throwing axes\nfor his ranged attack. These axes, though obviously not the ones with\nthe most range, could effectively kill whatever they were thrown at\n(with the exception of large, heavily armored enemies like trolls);\nhowever, he rarely uses them in the films. In the movies, Gimli threw an\naxe at the cave troll and at Gandalf in Fangorn Forest. He also throws\none at an Uruk at beginning of the battle of Amon Hen. It is apparent\nthat he prefers engaging in direct combat rather than using his throwing\naxes. Only on the PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube platforms of the Two\nTowers Gimli has 25 throwing axes and Gimli has 30 throwing axes in the\n_The Return of the King_ video game on the same above mentioned\nplatforms as well as Mac and PC. This game also came out on the Gameboy\nAdvance. Throwing axes however makes this function different in _The Two\nTowers_ and _The Return of the King_ on the Gameboy Advance it is\navailable but to perform this function at the cost of certain points to\ndo this certain ability. Though they can effectively damage/kill enemies\nwhen charged, they are actually the weakest among Gimli's ranged attacks\nunlike the ranged attacks of Aragorn and Legolas. Still, they do have\npotency up to some extent."

He followed the House of\nFingolfin during the Flight of the Ñoldor, but he took no part in the\nKinslaying at Alqualondë.\n\nFirst Age\n\n\n\nAfter the exile, Glorfindel followed Turgon to Gondolin. He was\nappointed as the Lord of the House of the Golden Flower and one of the\ncaptains of the King. He was popular and well-loved by the Gondolindrim.\n\nWhen Aredhel wished to depart Gondolin in search for the Sons of Fëanor,\nTurgon appointed Glorfindel, Ecthelion, and Egalmoth to be her escorts.\nThey were denied entrance to Doriath, and instead turned north where the\nescort lost Aredhel near Nan Dungortheb. They later returned to Gondolin\nwithout her.\n\nAlong with King Turgon, Glorfindel fought in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad,\nholding the King's flanks as they retreated towards the Pass of\nSirion.\n\nFall of Gondolin\n\n\n\nIn FA 510, the forces of Melkor attacked Gondolin, with the help of\nMaeglin's treachery.

His body was later borne up by Thorondor, Lord of\nEagles, who flew down into the Abyss to rescue Glorfindel's broken body,\nreturning it to his people who buried him high on the cliffs of the\nMountains which surrounded Gondolin. It was said that yellow flowers\n(possibly celandine) grew on his mound, despite its rocky location.\n\nSecond Age\n\nReturn to Middle-earth\n\nGlorfindel's spirit departed to the Halls of Mandos, where he spent\nyears with the spirits of the others who died. Due to his noble actions,\nvalor and bravery that saved many Elves during the Fall of Gondolin, he\nwas re-embodied after a short time.\n\nA thousand years later, in SA 1600, Manwë sent him back to Middle-earth\nas an emissary of the Valar and granted him powers nearly as strong as\nthat of the Maiar's.\n\nThird Age\n\nIt is possible that Glorfindel remained for a time in Lindon along with\nthe other noble Elves, such as Gil-galad, Círdan, and Elrond, a\ndescendant of Tuor and Idril.\n\nBattle of Fornost\n\n\n\nDuring the Battle of Fornost, Glorfindel was the major reason the evil\nWitch-King of Angmar was defeated. After the battle was over, and the\nWitch-King had fled, it was Glorfindel who predicted that no mortal man\nwould ever destroy the Witch-king. This prediction would come true a\nthousand years later at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, when Éowyn of\nRohan (a woman) and Meriadoc Brandybuck (a Hobbit) destroyed the\nWitch-King.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nA thousand years later, Glorfindel was sent by Lord Elrond to search for\nFrodo and his companions. He pursued some of the Nazgûl and drew them\naway from the Ford of Bruinen. He then found and led the company for\ndays stopping only briefly to let the Hobbits rest. When the Nazgul\napproached again, Glorfindel put Frodo on his white horse Asfaloth, and\nbade the horse take Frodo to Rivendell. Asfaloth out ran the black\nhorses of the Nazgûl and managed to cross the Ford of Bruinen which lead\nto Rivendell. A severely weakened Frodo, conscious but delirious due to\nthe wound he was carrying from the Morgul Blade, turned back to defy the\nRiders who pleaded for him to come with them. The Nazgul entered the\nshallow ford but were there un-horsed and swept away by a torrent of\nenchanted water which guarded the entrance to Imladris charged with the\npower of the Half-elven and indeed by Gandalf the Grey. He later led\nthe injured Frodo and the rest of the company safely to Rivendell.\n\nAt the Council of Elrond, Glorfindel sat in a position of honour\nalongside Elrond and Gandalf. He suggested that the One Ring should be\neither sent to Tom Bombadil and cast into the depths of the Sea, but\nGandalf believed that the One may resurface on land after a hundred or\nthousand years. He was briefly considered to be a member of the\nFellowship of the Ring, but was later ruled out: his power would be of\nno use in a mission of secrecy to Mordor.\n\nAfter the War\n\nAfter the Ring's destruction, Glorfindel, along with Erestor and the\nsons of Elrond, witnessed the wedding of Aragorn and Arwen. His\nultimate fate is not known, but it is reasonable to assume that he\neventually sailed to Valinor with the rest of his kin.\n\n\nCharacter\n\n\n\nGlorfindel was known for his golden hair, which at some point, was\ndescribed to be yellow. He was an elf of great bodily and spiritual\nstructure, wisdom, and bravery. The Gondolindrim loved him dearly and\nwept upon witnessing his passing at Cirith Thoronath. He was a\ncapable leader, as seen when he led his House during the Fall, and loyal\nto his King and brothers-in-arms. He was very courageous and mindful of\nthe refugees as they escaped. He chose to protect all the escaping\nGondolindrim (especially Tuor and Idril), though he “would have defended\nthem even had they been fugitives of any rank”. He displayed more of\nhis power and courage when he faced against the Nine Riders to save\nFrodo, and when he participated in the Council of Elrond.\n==Powers==\n\nGlorfindel was a very capable fighter, with great endurance; he fought\nfor hours during the Fall of Gondolin and managed to face against a\nBalrog on his own.\n\nAfter his re-embodiment, Manwë had given Glorfindel powers nearly equal\nto the Maiar's, to help him in his missions in Middle-earth. He was\nconsidered one of the most powerful elves from Rivendell, given by his\npowerful and almost “angelic” presence, which had made the Black Riders\nflee many times. He also had medicinal knowledge, as seen when he\ntends to Frodo's wounds.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis original name is said to have been LAUREFINDIL, which is the Quenya\nfor “Golden-haired”, from _laurë_ (“golden”) and _findilë_ (“head of\nhair”). _GLORFINDEL_ is simply the Sindarin translation of\nLaurefindil, from _glaur_ (“golden”) and _fîn_ or _find_ (“lock of\nhair”).\n\n\nParentage\n\nGlorfindel was said to be descended from a house of princes and one of\nthe noble elves in Gondolin. Due to his golden hair, he might be\ndescended from a Ñoldorin-Vanyarin intermarriage, like Finrod and\nGaladriel. His loyalty and following Turgon also indicated that he could\nbe one of Turgon's kin, despite Turgon and the House of Fingolfin having\ndark hair. In _The Complete Guide to Middle-earth_, it is suggested that\nGlorfindel is a member of the House of Finarfin.\n\n\nControversy\n\nIn Tolkien's early drafts, there were two Glorfindels: a Glorfindel of\nGondolin and a Glorfindel of Rivendell. These two were initially thought\nto be different individuals. While writing _The Lord of the Rings_,\nTolkien borrowed a name from one of the earlier elves. As the\nlegendarium grew more diverse, however, Tolkien decided that an elf who\nhad fought in many wars might be a good companion for Gandalf. He\nexplained in _The Last Writings_ that the Glorfindel of Gondolin and\nGlorfindel of Rivendell are one and the same:\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nUpon deciding Glorfindel's return to Middle-earth, Tolkien came up with\nthree options: SA 1200 (during Annatar's appearance in Númenor), SA 1600\n(the completion of Barad-dûr), or TA 1000 (with the five Istari).\nAlthough all were probable, Tolkien favoured the SA 1600 as Glorfindel's\nreturn.\n\nDuring the first draft of _The Council of Elrond_, Glorfindel was among\nof what was to become the Fellowship of the Ring, along with Durin son\nof Balin (who later became Gimli son of Gloin) and Trotter (later named\nStrider or Aragorn).\n\n\nAppearances in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The History of Middle-earth_\n-   _The Silmarillion_\n-   _The Children of Hurin_\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n\nIn the films\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_ (cameo)\n-   _The Return of the King_ (cameo)\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nGlorfindel was left out of Ralph Bakshi's version of the Lord of the\nRings, with Legolas in place of him when Aragorn was supposed to meet\nhim before the attack at the Ford of Bruinen.\n\nLord of the Rings film trilogy\n\nIn The Fellowship of the Ring, Glorfindel's role in guiding Frodo\nBaggins to Rivendell is filled by Arwen, though he does appear during\nthe prologue when Sauron is defeated. In The Return of the King,\nGlorfindel is seen walking next to Arwen as she is having her vision of\nher son Eldarion during the journey to The Grey Havens. In his last\nappearance, he is seen at the crowning of King Elessar, behind Legolas\nand in front of Arwen. In all appearances in the movies he has no\nspeaking lines.\n\nRadio versions\n\nHe was included in the BBC's Lord of the Rings radio serial in 1981 and\nwas voiced by John Webb.\n\nVideo games\n\n\nTrivia\n\n-   In the 1978 film of The Lord of the Rings, Glorfindel's part was\n    taken by Legolas when leading the Hobbits and Strider to Rivendell.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   At one stage Tolkien considered whether Glorfindel was one of the\n    Blue Wizards, but he later decided against this.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   In July 2007, 3-D entertainment model producer Gentle Giant Studios,\n    Inc., headquartered in Burbank, California, released an exclusive\n    sculpted Glorfindel bust, limited to 500 pieces, for the 2007 San\n    Diego Comic-Con.

Soon he had to retreat due to the\ndeath of Théodred. He distinguished himself during the Second Battle of\nthe Fords of Isen by holding off a large army of Orcs for an extended\nperiod of time, then staging a retreat with minimal losses when enemy\nforces arrived.\n\nLater in the War of the Ring, he commanded the Right-wing of the\nRohirrim army sent to aid Gondor at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields\nuntil he was slain by Orcs.\n\n\nBiography\n\nHailing from Westfold, he was one of King Théoden's commanders.\n\nDuring the time of the War of the Ring, he distinguished himself\nfighting alongside Elfhelm and Théodred, Théoden's son, in the Battles\nof the Fords of Isen. In particular, Grimbold managed to save Théodred's\nbody from Saruman's Uruk-hai after he was mortally wounded. Grimbold\nlater assumed command of the Rohirrim of Westfold as Erkenbrand was\ndelayed, sharing it with Elfhelm of the East-mark.\n\nWhile Elfhelm wanted to abandon the Fords, Grimbold wanted to hold them,\npartially due to the tradition of Westfold. Grimbold was surrounded but\nhis shield-wall held despite no aid from Erkenbrand and Elfhelm.\nGrimbold then orchestrated a daring break out. He mounted all the riders\nfor whom he had horses and made a gap on the east side of the wall\nthrough which the riders passed. They formed into two groups and\nattacked the north and south sides simultaneously. In the ensuing\nconfusion, the remaining Rohirrim retreated on foot as quickly as they\ncould in the dark.\n\n\n\nAs a reward for his valour, he was promoted to Third Marshal of the Mark\n(holding the function though not the title), which was left vacant when\nÉomer was reinstated to lead the _First Éored_ during the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields. Grimbold fell in that battle slain by Orcs.

He became the first Lord\nof Dor-lómin and was accounted mighty even among the Eldar. Hador and\nhis wife Gildis had three children: Glóredhel the first child and only\ndaughter, Galdor the second child and elder son, and Gundor the last\nchild and younger son.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nHador was the son of Hathol and the great-great-grandson of Marach, (who\nfirst led the people of the Third House into Beleriand and was their\nfirst chieftain), and heir to the House of Marach. He entered the\nservice of Fingolfin, the High King of the Ñoldor, at a young age. Hador\nwas loved by the King, and he rose high in the esteem of many of the\nEldar. Eventually, Hador would even become a part of Fingolfin's own\ncouncil. Realizing the need for the Edain to live under their own lords\nand have lands of their own, Fingolfin granted as a fief to Hador the\nland of Dor-lómin (land of echoes) which thus made him the first Lord of\nDor-lómin. Hador gathered most of the people of the Third House into\nthat land, which lay in Hithlum between the Kingdom of Fingolfin and his\neldest son Fingon. There, Hador's people became numerous; and he\nencouraged the use of the Sindarin tongue.\n\nHador continued to win renown among the Eldar as the Lord of Dor-lómin,\nas well as among Men. Two of Hador's children, Galdor and Glóredhel,\nwere wedded to two of the children of Halmir Chieftain of the Haladin,\nrespectively Hareth his daughter and Haldir his son of the House of\nHaleth, when the two peoples met for a great feast. Fingolfin also gave\nto Hador a great helm made by Telchar of Nogrod. It was made in the\nlikeness of the dragon Glaurung, and came to be known as the Dragon-helm\nof Dor-lómin; it could only be borne by one of great stature and\nstrength. In the year 455 of the First Age, Morgoth broke the Siege of\nAngband in the Dagor Bragollach. Hador fought alongside Fingolfin with\nwhat few warriors of the Third House he could gather against the swift\nonset of Morgoth's forces. He was slain, however, defending the retreat\nof his lord. His younger son, Gundor, fell beside him before the\nfortress of Eithel Sirion. It was said that their deaths were greatly\nmourned by the Eldar.\n\n\n\nThough he was accounted one of the mightiest chieftain of the Edain in\nthe First Age, Hador is not well-known aside from being the namesake of\nthe Third House of the Edain. However, he was the forefather of many\nother heroes. His grandsons were Hurin and Huor. His great-grandsons\nwere Túrin and Tuor Eladar, and his great-great grandson was Eärendil\nthe Mariner. Aragorn Elessar, as well as all the Kings of Númenor,\nGondor and Arnor were descended from Hador. Maybe the best thing ever\nsaid regarding the legacy of Hador was this passage, written by J.R.R.\nTolkien in the Silmarillion:\n\n  “The Men of the Three Houses throve and multiplied, but greatest among\n  them was the house of Hador Goldenhead, peer of Elven-lords. His\n  people were of great strength and stature, ready in mind, bold and\n  steadfast, quick to anger and to laughter, mighty among the Children\n  of Ilúvatar in the youth of Mankind.”"

He said of the Hobbits, “A little people, but of\ngreat worth are the Shire-folk. Little do they know of our long labor\nfor the safekeeping of their borders, and yet I grudge it not.”\n\nIn response to a message sent to Rivendell by Galadriel, Halbarad led\nthe Grey Company comprised of 30 Dúnadan south to the aid of their\nkinsman Aragorn. Aragorn rejoiced at their coming, and Théoden remarked\nthus; “It is well! If these kinsmen be in any way like yourself, my Lord\nAragorn, thirty such knights will be a strength that cannot be counted\nby heads.”\n\nWith them also rode Elladan and Elrohir, the sons of Elrond. They caught\nup with Aragorn near the Fords of Isen in Rohan in the early hours of\nMarch 6, 3019. Halbarad brought Aragorn a message from Arwen as well as\na standard made by her, which Aragorn asked Halbarad to keep for him for\na while.\n\nHalbarad accompanied Aragorn to a chamber high in the Hornburg where\nAragorn looked into the Palantir and revealed himself to Sauron. That\nmorning Aragorn decided to take the Paths of the Dead, down the Dimholt\nRoad, under the White Mountains and Halbarad and the Grey Company went\nwith him, along with Legolas and Gimli. When they reached the entrance\nat daybreak on March 8, Halbarad said, “_This is an evil door, and my\ndeath lies beyond it. I will dare to pass it nonetheless..._”\n\nAt midnight at the Stone of Erech, Aragorn summoned the Dead to fulfill\ntheir oaths and Halbarad unfurled Aragorn's standard, which appeared\nblack with no device in the darkness. The Grey Company and the Army of\nthe Dead passed through the lands of the South to Pelargir, where they\ncaptured the fleet of the Corsairs. Aragorn dismissed the Dead, and the\nGrey Company sailed up the Anduin.\n\nWhen they arrived at the Pelennor Fields on March 15 in the midst of the\nbattle, Aragorn's standard was once again unfurled but now it was seen\nto bear the emblem of the White Tree of Gondor and the Seven Stars and\nCrown of Elendil. Halbarad carried the standard onto the battlefield,\nwhere he was killed.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Halbarad_ is mostly Sindarin in origin: _hal_ (tall) + _barad_ (tower)\n= “tall tower”.\n\n\nAppearances in adaptations\n\n\n\nRadio\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings_ (1981 radio series), Halbarad was voiced by\nthe actor Martyn Read.\n\nBorn of Hope\n\nHalbarad also appears in the fan-made film _Born of Hope_ (2009) and was\nplayed by Ollie Goodchild (as a teenager) and Lars Mattes (as a boy). An\ninconsistency of Halbarad's appearance is that he ended up being a\nteenager while Aragorn was a toddler (namely, older than Aragorn\nhimself). If this were true, Halbarad would have been well over 90 years\nold when he fell in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, and there is no\nindication that he belongs to the House of Elros. (He was a descendant,\nlike all Dunedain, of the Numenoreans and the gift of long life was\ngiven to Numenor, not to Elros solely, and so Halbarad could have been\nolder than Aragorn and still in his middle years.)\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: War in the North\n\nHalbarad appears in the recent video game _Lord of the Rings: War in the\nNorth_ as the leader of the Dúnedain guarding the Shire camped at Sarn\nFord. He sends the player's party on a quest to the Barrow Downs to\nlocate two lost rangers, Luin and Kilaren. He is modeled with greying\nhair and a large beard in this adaptation.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings Online\n\nIn ''The Lord of the Rings Online, ''Halbarad first appears as commander\nof Esteldin, a hidden Dúnedain city in the North Downs.

    "text": "HALDIR was an Elf of Lothlórien, probably a Silvan Elf, and a\nmarchwarden who guarded the forest's northern borders. When the\nFellowship of the Ring arrived in Lórien, he became their guide to Caras\nGaladhon. He and his companions are described as wearing grey hooded\ncloaks and residing on platforms or flets.\n\nHaldir was accompanied by his brothers, Rúmil and Orophin, who\ninteracted little with the Fellowship because they, unlike Haldir, spoke\nlittle of the Common Tongue. Haldir could speak it fluently, as he often\ntravelled outside of Lothlórien. Little is known about his brothers.\n\n\nBiography\n\nThird Age\n\n\n\nOn January 15, 3019, the brothers encountered the Fellowship near the\nNimrodel in the eaves of the forest. Haldir was able to speak to the\nFellowship, for he knew the Common Tongue. Haldir welcomed Legolas as\none of his kindred from the north and recognized Aragorn as a friend to\nLady Galadriel. He was prepared to lead the Fellowship into Lórien, but\nhe hesitated upon learning that one of the party was a Dwarf. After\nconsulting with his brothers, Haldir agreed that Gimli could enter if he\nwent blindfolded. The fellowship then insisted that if one of them had\nto go blindfolded, they all would. The brothers reluctantly agreed, and\nthen led them into the forest.\n\nThey spent the night on a Flet, or a platform in the trees. During the\nnight, Haldir and his brothers heard Orcs passing and lured them away\nfrom the Fellowship. When he returned to the flet, Haldir saw a strange\ncreature at the base of the tree, which Frodo guessed to be Gollum.\n\nIn the morning, Haldir fashioned a rope bridge for the Fellowship to use\nto cross the Silverlode. Haldir learned from Merry Brandybuck that the\nGrey Havens lay west of the Shire, and he spoke longingly of the sea,\nbut sadly of the time when he and his kin would have to leave Lorien.\nWhen news came that the Fellowship's blindfolds could be removed, Haldir\napologized to Gimli and welcomed him as the first Dwarf to enter Lórien\nsince the time of Durin.\n\nAfter guiding the Fellowship to Caras Galadhon, Haldir returned to his\nduties guarding the northern borders, but he returned when the\nFellowship was about to depart to guide them to the banks of the\nSilverlode, where boats awaited them.\n\nNothing further is known of Haldir's activities. It is likely that he\nparticipated in the defense of Lothlórien when the forces of Dol Guldur\nattacked it in March of 3019.\n\nHaldir was one of the few Elves of Lórien who could speak Westron. He\nhad clearly heard of Aragorn, but there is no indication that they had\nmet previously.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film trilogy\n\nIn Peter Jackson's Film Trilogy, Haldir was portrayed by Craig Parker in\n_The Fellowship of the Ring_ and _The Two Towers_.\n\n\n\nHaldir's role is greatly expanded in the films: In _The Two Towers_, he\nwas sent by Elrond and led an army of five hundred elves from Lothlórien\nto Helm's Deep. They were stationed on the battlements and behind the\nDeeping Wall. They held off the Isengard assault until a bomb was set\noff and destroyed the walls. The elves, on Aragorn's command, charged\nstraight into a wall of Uruk-hai pikes.\n\nDuring the breaching of the walls, the Rohirrim and elves retreated to\nthe Keep. Haldir was passing the command to his warriors when he was\nattacked by either side by two Uruks. He killed both, but one stabbed\nhim in the chest with the inward-spike of its sword before it was slain.\nWhile in a daze, looking out at the bodies of his fallen friends and\nseeing all his brethren falling back, he was slashed on the back of his\nneck. Aragorn rushed to his side and attempted to brace him up, but\nHaldir had fallen.\n\n\n\nAragorn looked upon him with much love and respect, placing his hand on\nHaldir's heart. Hearing oncoming Uruk-hai about to corner him, as he was\nthe last one left on the wall, he respectfully laid down his fallen\nfriend's body and escaped.\n\nThe Battle of Helm's Deep would have been a quick victory for the ten\nthousand Uruk-hai warriors, but the Galadhrim elves were highly skilled\nand highly trained warriors, their defense of the Deeping Wall lasted\nalmost the entire night, and their heavy sacrifice gave the defenders\nthe time needed to wait out the siege. They were the key to the Free\nPeoples' victory.\n\nThéoden held a ceremony and funeral for Haldir and his fallen regiment,\nburying them with great honor at the burial mounds of Edoras at the\nbeginning of _The Return of the King_. The only elf confirmed to have\nsurvived the battle was Legolas, Prince of Mirkwood. Jackson may have\nkilled off Haldir in the film to dramatize the sacrifice of the elves.\n\nDifferences between the film and the novel\n\nHaldir did not come to Helm's Deep at all in the novel. In Tolkien's\naccount there were no elves at Helm's Deep (aside from Legolas), and the\nElves of Lórien were occupied in battles against forces out of Moria and\nDol Guldur, which were only mentioned in passing. Although the\nhalf-elven brothers Elladan and Elrohir did turn up at Dunharrow, this\nwas after the Battle of the Hornburg had ended.

After her father and her twin brother Haldar were slain in an\nOrc raid, Haleth became leader of the House. She held her people\ntogether for seven days until Caranthir and his men drove out the orcs\nand ended their siege on the Haladin. Seeing, at last, what great\ncourage dwelt in the hearts of some men, Caranthir did Haleth great\nhonour by offering her people land in the north under the protection of\nthe Eldar. However, out of pride and a desire to remain independent, she\ndeclined the generous offer and instead gathered what remained of her\npeople after the orc siege and led them to Estolad.\n\nAgainst the desire of her people, Haleth led the Haladin even further\nwest to the land between the Mountains of Terror and the Girdle of\nMelian. Suffering much hardship and loss, many regretted taking part in\nthe journey. Eventually, Haleth led her people to the relative safety of\nthe Forest of Brethil on the western border of Doriath where they\nsettled for the duration of the First Age. The Haladin then became known\nas the House of Haleth. She remained chieftainess of the Haladin until\nshe died, and retained a picked bodyguard of women. When she died, her\npeople raised a green mound for her in the heights of the forest -\nnamed _Tur Haretha_, the Ladybarrow, or _Haudh-en-Arwen_ in Sindarin.\nHaving never married, the leadership of the Haladin passed on to her\nnephew Haldan, son of her brother Haldar."

    "text": "HELM HAMMERHAND was the ninth King of Rohan, and the end of the first\nline of its Kings. His rule was plagued by war with the Dunlendings that\nattempted to usurp his rule of Rohan.\n\n\nBiography\n\nHelm was born in TA 2691 and was the son of Gram. He became King at the\nage of fifty when his father Gram died in TA 2741 during a time of\ncrisis. His father had fought open warfare with the Dunlendings, who\noperated from the captured fortress of Isengard.\n\nDuring his reign, King Helm came into conflict with an arrogant,\nwealthy, and powerful landowner named Freca. Freca was a Dunlending with\nRohirric blood; he claimed to be a descendant of King Fréawine of Rohan.\nFreca held lands - both banks of the river Adorn and his stronghold was\nnear its source on the borders of Rohan. Freca viewed King Helm with\nboth contempt and scorn, while Helm mistrusted Freca and was wary of\nhim.\n\nIn TA 2754, Freca attempted to intimidate and coerce King Helm into\ngiving his approval and consent to an arranged marriage between Freca's\nson Wulf and Helm's daughter. Freca marched to a meeting of the King's\ncouncil in Edoras with a great force of men, planning to threaten the\nKing into complying with his demands. In the resulting quarrel, Helm\nHammerhand smote Freca with single blow from his fist. The blow was so\ngreat Freca died soon after. Enraged, the men of Freca left Edoras, and\nKing Helm declared Wulf and his kin enemies of the King.\n\nFour years later in TA 2758, a combined force of Dunlendings under the\nleadership of Wulf, and the Corsairs of Umbar overran Rohan. Helm was\ndefeated in battle at the Crossings of Isen, and Helm withdrew into the\nHornburg at Helm's Deep (which was later renamed in his honor). There,\nhe endured a long siege.\n\nWhile King Helm and his younger son Prince Háma were besieged in the\nHornburg, a force of Dunlendings under the leadership of Wulf also\nbesieged Edoras. Prince Haleth, King Helm's elder son who was the last\ndefender to fall, led the defence of Edoras. He fell defending the doors\nof the Golden Hall .\n\nShortly after Yule 2758, Prince Háma accompanied by a small force went\nout to search for food, but he and his men were lost in a blizzard and\nnever seen again. The Hornburg held a large war-horn, and whenever it\nwas blown, Helm would break through the Dunlending ranks, slaying many\nof their men. Helm's came to fear him greatly during this time and it\nwas believed that he became so fierce and terrible, that he slew many of\nthem with his bare hands. It was also believed that when he grew hungry\nand had no food he ate men.\n\nIt was said that grief and hunger made Helm more ferocious. After one\nsuch sortie, Helm died and did not return; his body was discovered the\nnext morning frozen in the snow still standing, his eyes open, ready to\nfight. This led to a belief among the Rohirrim and Dunlendings that even\nin death the wraith of Helm Hammerhand still wandered through Rohan, and\ndefended the Hornburg. Helm died in TA 2759 at the age of sixty-eight.\nPrince Haleth and Prince Háma also died during the war; his nephew\nFréaláf Hildeson, who defeated the Dunlendings, succeeded Helm.\n\nHelm was called Hammerhand because of his great strength and prowess\nwith his fists: he was known to fight barehanded. This is sometimes\nattributed to a superstition that if “he used no weapon no weapon would\nupon bite him”.\n\n\nPortrayal in Adaptations\n\nIn the video game _Middle-earth: Shadow of War_, he is a boss fight as a\nNazgûl. He received his ring from Sauron and Celebrimbor after he was\nmortally wounded in an ambush during which his daughter was kidnapped.\nAfter recovering, he led a group of men to the man responsible for the\nambush, but accidentally fatally struck his daughter in rage. This\nfurther fueled his anger, and he preceeded to slaughter everyone in the\nroom, including his own troops who tried to calm him down. He wields a\ngreat hammer unlike the Helm of the books, and the story appears to be a\ngood bit different, as his date of birth is believed to have been pushed\nup to the end of the Second Age in order to fit in with the game's\ntimeline. His hammer later ends up in the hands of Talion after the\nlatter joins the nine himself."

    "text": "HÚRIN, more commonly known as HÚRIN THALION and ÚMARTH, was a hero of\nMen during the First Age. He was the father of the tragic Túrin\nTurambar. According to _The Silmarillion_, he was the greatest warrior\nof Men in the First Age.\n\n\nBiography\n\nLife in Dor-lómin\n\nHúrin was a grandson of Hador, of the _House of Marach_ or _House of\nHador_. Húrin was the elder son of Galdor of the House of Marach and\nHareth of the Haladin, and he had a younger brother Huor. He was known\nto be of unimpressive stature, so much so that he could not wear the\nDragon-helm of Dor-lómin because it was too large on him to fit\nproperly. Despite this, his prowess in combat surpassed that of all his\npeers.\n\nIn the year FA 458, Huor and Húrin dwelt with their kin in the forest of\nBrethil, when they joined a war party against Orcs. The brothers ended\nup in the Vale of Sirion, and were cut off from their company. Chased by\norcs, the Vala Ulmo caused a mist to arise from the rivers, and the\nbrothers escaped into Dimbar, there two Great Eagles picked them up, and\nbrought them to Gondolin. King Turgon of Gondolin welcomed the brothers,\nremembering Ulmo's prophecy that the House of Hador would aid Gondolin\nin their time of greatest need. Turgon wished them to remain as he grew\nto love them, but the brothers wished to return to their kin. The\nbrothers swore an oath to keep Gondolin secret, and Eagles brought them\nback to Dor-Lómin.\n\nIn FA 462 Morgoth assailed Hithlum and Húrin's father Galdor the Tall\nfell defending the Ered Wethrin. Húrin chased the Orcs away with heavy\nlosses over the plains of Anfauglith. Afterwards, Húrin was the Lord of\nDor-lómin and ruled over the Hadorian fief of Dor-lómin in Hithlum.\n\nTwo years later, he wedded Morwen Elf-Sheen of the House of Bëor, and\nlater in the year was born their son Túrin. A daughter Lalaith followed,\nbut she died aged three years old by a plague sent from Angband.\n\nNirnaeth Arnoediad\n\n\n\nIn FA 473, in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Húrin fought alongside Huor and\nthe Sons of Hador. In the midst of battle, he met again with Turgon, and\ntheir meeting was sweet. When the battle was lost, Húrin and Huor\ngathered all the remaining men of the House of Hador and they took a\nstand fighting off the Orcs, allowing Turgon to escape. Step by step,\nthe army of Morgoth pushed them back. They stepped back until the river\nRivil was in front of them, there they did not take one-step back. They\nkept on fighting until dusk when Huor was slain. In the end, Húrin stood\nthere alone, there he threw his sword and shield on the ground and he\ntook a grand battle-axe of an Orc captain. He waded alone into Gothmog's\nbodyguard of Trolls, and with every one he slew he yelled with all his\nvoice: ''“Aure entuluva!” ''(“Day will come again!”) This battle cry was\nheard seventy times. Húrin fought with the battle axe until the axe\nitself withered away from the caustic blood of the trolls he had been\nslaying. He was grappled by the orcs and taken hostage, even though he\nhewed their limbs off as they grabbed him. Húrin was brought captive to\nMorgoth, and despite horrific torture, he refused to reveal the location\nof Gondolin. Due to his defiance, Morgoth cursed him and his family to\nmisery and hopelessness.\n\nHúrin was placed high on the peaks of Thangorodrim, either chained or\nmagically immobilised in a seat where, through the power of Morgoth, he\ncould see all the evils that later befell his son Túrin. He never saw\nhis second daughter Nienor, who was born while he was a captive.\n\nRelease from captivity and death\n\n\n\nIn the year FA 500, after the death of his children, Morgoth released\nHúrin, feigning pity to an utterly defeated foe. In reality however,\nMorgoth hoped that the bitterness and hate that had been wrought in\nHúrin throughout his years of watching his family suffer would cause\nstrife and misfortune to those whom Húrin encountered. He was brought to\nhis old homelands in Hithlum, but the Easterlings now living there at\nfirst did not recognize him and later feared him, believing him to be\nhigh in Morgoth's favor. The House of Hador had been destroyed or\nenslaved. Seven outlaws joined Húrin, and together they went to the vale\nof Sirion, where he once had known Gondolin. Húrin abandoned the outlaws\nand sought for the entrance, but Gondolin was closed, and Turgon at\nfirst did not wish to allow Húrin in. Húrin cried out against Turgon,\nthus inadvertently revealing the general location of Gondolin to\nMorgoth's spies, and then left. Only after he had left did Turgon have a\nchange of heart and send Eagles to fetch him, but they came too late and\ndid not find him.\n\nHúrin continued to the forest of Brethil where his son and daughter had\ndied, and met his wife Morwen there at their grave, just before she,\ntoo, died. In anger and despair, he sought out the Haladin, blaming them\nfor the death of his wife and children, and after being put on trial\ncaused a revolt in which Hardang, of the house of Haldad, was slain .\nHúrin met up again with the outlaws, and together with a few of the\nHaladin, they went to Nargothrond, where Húrin killed the Petty-dwarf\nMîm who had claimed the treasure of Glaurung, earning a curse on the\ngold. Húrin and his outlaws brought the treasure to Doriath, insulting\nThingol by giving it as a fee for his 'good care' of Húrin's kin. The\noutlaws did not accept this, and a bitter battle was fought at\nMenegroth, leading to the death of all of them, and further cursing the\ngold. Húrin thus brought a curse on Doriath as well, eventually leading\nto its downfall.\n\nMelian's kind words managed to break through to Húrin's clouded mind,\nand Húrin finally saw that all his deeds had only aided Morgoth. A\nbroken man, he finally cast himself in the sea and ended his life.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Sindarin, _HÚRIN_ means “steadfast” and _THALION_ means “hardened.”\nÚMARTH means “ill-fate”.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn early versions of Tolkien's mythology, Húrin was called ÚRIN or\nÚRINTHALION.\n\n\nGallery"

After the\nPelennor fields had been cleared, Aragorn, Éomer and Imrahil rode to the\nGate of Minas Tirith.\n\nImrahil recognized that Aragorn was the rightful King, but he agreed\nthat it was wise for Aragorn to wait to enter the city because Imrahil\nknew his brother-in-law Denethor was strong-willed and proud. When\nImrahil learned that Denethor was dead and Faramir was dying, he\nsuggested that Aragorn be summoned, remembering that the Kings of old\nwere great healers. Aragorn came at Gandalf's request to heal the\nwounded Faramir, Éowyn, and Merry, but he declared that Prince Imrahil\nshould rule the City until Faramir awoke, in effect granting Imrahil the\nposition of Steward.\n\nDuring the debate of the Captains of the West, Gandalf proposed that\nthey march to the Black Gate to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo\nthe Ring-bearer. Imrahil said that he would follow his liege Aragorn,\nbut since Minas Tirith was under his command the Prince advised that\nsome should remain to defend the City. In the end it was decided that an\narmy of 7,000 would ride forth. Imrahil laughed and said:\n\n  _“Surely this is the greatest jest in all the history of Gondor: that\n  we should ride with seven thousands, scarce as many as the vanguard of\n  its army in the days of its power, to assail the mountains and the\n  impenetrable gate of the Black Land! So might a child threaten a\n  mail-clad knight with a bow of string and green willow!”_ (The Return\n  of the King: “The Last Debate”)\n\nThe Host of the West left Minas Tirith on March 18. Bypassing Minas\nMorgul and marching north, the heralds announced the coming of King\nElessar at Imrahil's advice. When Sauron's forces emerged from the Black\nGate on March 25, Imrahil stood on the front line with his men. They\nfought the Battle of the Black Gate until the One Ring was destroyed.\n\nPrince Imrahil was present at the celebrations of the field of\nCormallen, and the coronation of Aragorn as King Elessar, and rode with\nthe funeral procession of King Théoden to Rohan, remaining in Edoras\nafter the King's burial on August 10. Imrahil and Éomer became great\nfriends, and in TA 3021 Éomer wed Imrahil's daughter Lothíriel.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, Prince Imrahil and his nephew Prince Faramir\nwere King Elessar's chief commanders. Imrahil was also part of the Great\nCouncil of Gondor, and remained an adviser of the King.\n\nPrince Imrahil died in the year 34 of the Fourth Age, and was succeed by\nhis eldest son Elphir, who continued the line of Princes."

Indis was known for\nher great beauty and was thus referred to as INDIS THE FAIR.\n\n\nBiography\n\nIn YT 1185 , Indis married Finwë, the High King of the Ñoldor and was\nhis second wife after the death of Míriel Serindë. She bore two sons,\nFingolfin and Finarfin, and two daughters, Findis and Irimë. Through\nFinwë's first marriage, she was the stepmother to Fëanor, his first and\nonly son to Míriel.\n\nUnfortunately, Fëanor harbored very little love for her or her sons\nwhich probably contributed to his mistrust of Fingolfin when Melkor\nbegan spreading his poisonous lies amongst the Ñoldor.\n\nAfter the death of Finwë and the rebellion of the Ñoldor, Indis and her\neldest daughter Findis returned to their people of the Vanyar and dwelt\nthere until Manwë restored Finwë to life. Their second daughter Irimë,\nhowever, went into exile with her brother Fingolfin.\n\n\n\n\nThe Descendants of Indis\n\nThrough her elder son Fingolfin, Indis was the grandmother of Turgon,\nhis second son; and thus she was the great-great-great grandmother of\nElrond and Elros, and through Elros, the line of the Dunedain.\n\nThrough her younger son Finarfin, Indis was the grandmother of his only\ndaughter the great Lady Galadriel of Lothlórien, thus adjoining Indis to\nGaladriel's daughter Celebrian as her great grandmother and once more to\nCelebrian's children, Elladan, Elrohir, and Arwen Undómiel, as their\ngreat-great grandmother. Also, in being connected to Arwen in this way,\nIndis was also distantly related to the Kings of Gondor, as Arwen\nmarried King Elessar of Gondor, and produced the heir to the throne,\nEldarion.\n\n\nOther versions in the legendarium\n\nIn earlier texts, she was the sister of Ingwë and referred in _The\nSilmarillion_ as his close kin.\n\nIn other versions, Indis bore five fair children to Finwë, two sons and\nthree daughters (Findis, Faniel, and Finvain)."

    "text": "ISILDUR was the oldest son of Elendil and brother to Anárion. As the\nHigh King of Gondor and Arnor, Isildur and his brother Anarion jointly\nruled Gondor in the South, while their father dwelled in the North.\n\nDuring the War of the Last Alliance, Isildur cut the One Ring from\nSauron's hand, but he refused to destroy it. Isildur was later killed by\nOrcs and the Ring was lost in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields for\nnearly 2,500 years. His refusal to destroy the Ring allowed Sauron's\nspirit to endure and ensured that he would remain a threat to\nMiddle-earth for years to come. Isildur's bloodline survived in the\nDúnedain of the North and his heirs would help end Sauron's power in the\nWar of the Ring.\n\n\nBiography\n\nLife in Númenor\n\nIsildur was born in Númenor in the year SA 3209 of the Second Age. He\nhad a younger brother Anárborn in SA 3219. They lived at the haven of\nRómenna on the east coast of the island of Númenor. Their father was\nElendil and their grandfather was Amandil, the Lord of Andúnië. The\nLords of Andúnië were descended from the Kings of Númenor through\nSilmarien, the daughter of the fourth King of Númenor, Tar-Elendil.\n\nElros, the Half-elven and the first King of Númenor, had chosen the\nmortal life of Men, while his brother Elrond chose the immortal life of\nElves. Over time, the Kings of Númenor grew to resent their ancestor's\nchoice and desired immortality for themselves. They became estranged\nfrom the Elves and from the powers called the Valar and they neglected\nthe worship of Eru, the one who had created them.\n\nA small group of Númenóreans remained friendly with the elves and\nfaithful to Eru and the Valar. They were called the Faithful. Among\nthese men were the Lords of Andúnië.\n\nIn SA 3262, Ar-Pharazon, the King of Númenor, took Sauron captive and\nbrought him to Númenor. Sauron allowed himself to be taken because he\nwanted to corrupt the Númenóreans in order to bring about their\ndownfall. He used their desire for immortality and power to convince\nthem to renounce Eru and worship Morgoth.\n\nIsildur learned that Sauron wanted Ar-Pharazon to cut down Nimloth, the\nWhite Tree that had come from the Undying Lands. Isildur disguised\nhimself and went secretly to the King's Court and took a fruit from\nNimloth. The guards discovered and attacked him and, although receiving\ngrave injuries, he managed to escape with the fruit. For this deed,\nIsildur received much praise. He stood near death for many months, but\nwhen the fruit of the White Tree began to sprout, he awoke and was\nrecovered from his injuries.\n\nAs Sauron's influence increased, the Faithful began to prepare to leave\nNúmenor. They filled their ships with their families and many of their\nprized possessions, including the Palantíri. Isildur had three ships of\nhis own, and he brought aboard the seedling of the White Tree as well as\nhis wife and his son Elendur, who had been born in SA 3299.\n\nIsildur's grandfather Amandil hoped to plead with the Valar to spare the\nFaithful. He sailed westward toward the Undying Lands, but what became\nof him is not known and he was never seen again.\n\nAs Ar-Pharazon felt the approach of old age, Sauron's lies finally\nconvinced him he could achieve immortality in the Undying Lands. In SA\n3319, Ar-Pharazon set out with a great fleet intending to take the\nUndying Lands by force, but when he set foot on the shore, Ilúvatar\ncaused the Seas to open up and Valinor was hidden. The fleet sank and\nNúmenor was destroyed by a great wave.\n\nLife in Middle-earth\n\nThe ships of the Faithful were spared, and a great wind from the west\nsent them to the shores of Middle-earth. Elendil landed in the north,\nwhile Isildur and Anarion came to the Mouths of the Anduin in the south.\nElendil and his sons established the North-kingdom of Arnor and the\nSouth-kingdom of Gondor in SA 3320. Elendil was the High King of both\nrealms, but he dwelt in Arnor and committed the rule of Gondor to his\nsons.\n\nIsildur and Anárion had their thrones side by side in the Great Hall of\nOsgiliath, the city they founded on the Anduin. Anarion lived in Minas\nAnor on the western side of the Anduin, while Isildur made his home in\nIthilien on the eastern side of the Anduin. Isildur built Minas Ithil in\na valley of the Mountains of Shadow on the border of Mordor. Minas Ithil\nwas a beautiful white city, but it was also a stronghold to defend\nagainst the evil that might still dwell in Mordor. It was not known at\nfirst that Sauron had already returned there in secret and had begun to\nrebuild his strength.\n\nIsildur had one of the Palantír called the Ithil-stone, which he used to\ncommunicate with his brother and father. He planted the seedling of the\nWhite Tree in front of his house. Isildur and his wife had two more sons\nwhile living in Gondor - Aratan born in SA 3339 and Ciryon born in SA\n3379.\n\nIn the early days of Gondor, Isildur went to the Hill of Erech at the\nentrance to the Blackroot Vale in the White Mountains. On the hilltop he\nplaced the Stone of Erech, a great black sphere that he had brought from\nNúmenor. Isildur met with the King of the Dead, who swore allegiance to\nIsildur upon the Stone, but later when Isildur called upon the Men of\nthe Mountains to join the fight against Sauron, they refused. Isildur\ncursed them and said that they would never rest until they fulfilled\ntheir oath, and they haunted the Paths of the Dead.\n\nSauron attacked and captured Minas Ithil in 3429. Isildur escaped with\nhis wife and sons and another seedling of the White Tree. Isildur and\nhis family boarded a ship at the Mouths of the Anduin and sailed around\nthe coast of Middle-earth to Arnor, where Elendil dwelled. Elendil\nconsulted with Gil-galad, the last High King of the Ñoldor in\nMiddle-earth who lived in Lindon west of Arnor. Gil-galad and Elendil\nformed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men to oppose Sauron in SA 3430.\nThat same year, Isildur's youngest son Valandil was born at the home of\nElrond in Rivendell.\n\nThe Last Alliance\n\nThe army of the Last Alliance gathered at Rivendell in SA 3431 and\nthen marched to war. Isildur and his three oldest sons - Elendur,\nAratan, and Ciryon - went with the army, while Isildur's wife and their\nyoung son Valandil remained in Rivendell.\n\nThe War of the Last Alliance began in SA 3434. Sauron's forces were\ndefeated in the Battle of Dagorlad on the plain outside Mordor, and the\narmy of the Last Alliance entered Sauron's realm and laid siege to\nBarad-dûr. The siege lasted seven years and many Men and Elves were\nkilled, including Isildur's brother Anárion who died in SA 3440.\n\n\n\nAt last in SA 3441, Sauron himself came down from his tower. He fought\nwith Gil-galad and Elendil on the slopes of Mount Doom. Sauron's body\nwas cast down, but Gil-galad and Elendil died in the struggle. Elendil's\nsword broke beneath him as he fell.\n\nIsildur took up the hilt of his sword and used the broken blade to cut\nthe One Ring from Sauron's hand. Sauron's spirit fled from his body, but\nas long as the Ring that held much of his power survived so would his\nspirit. Enamored by the Ring's apparent beauty, Isildur took it for\nhimself. Elrond and Círdan were the only two individuals who marked\nIsildur's actions, as they alone had been with Gil-galad during the\ncontest with Sauron, and Isildur alone had stood by Elendil. A very\nshort time later, short enough for the heat-induced markings on the Ring\nto still be visible, Isildur wrote a short account of the Ring and its\napparent properties, noting that it had burned his hand so badly that he\nbelieved it would hurt forever. He noted that the Ring, as it cooled,\nseemed to shrink, and that the writing upon it's outer band seemed to be\nfading. He theorized that the heat from Sauron's hand might have caused\nthe writing to remain visible, and that heating it again might produce\nthe same effect. However, he was already so enthralled by the Ring that\nhe refused, even in writing, to take any action which might cause harm\nto it.\n\nHigh King and Death\n\nIsildur assumed the Kingship of both Gondor and Arnor, but he intended\nto return to the North and leave Anarion's son Meneldil to rule in the\nSouth. He remained in Minas Anor for a few years to give counsel and\ninstruction to Meneldil. Together they took a journey through all the\nlands belonging to Gondor. On the summit of Halifirien in the Firien\nwood, Isildur entombed the body of his father Elendil. Before leaving\nMinas Anor, Isildur planted the seedling of the White Tree in memory of\nhis brother Anarion.\n\nOn September 5, TA 2, Isildur set out from Minas Anor with his three\nelder sons and 200 knights. They marched up the Vales of the Anduin on\nthe eastern side of the River, heading for the High Pass over the Misty\nMountains.\n\nThirty days later, on October 4, Isildur's company was attacked by Orcs\nnear the Gladden Fields. The Orcs did not know that Isildur had the One\nRing, but they were unwittingly drawn by its power. Isildur's men were\noutnumbered ten to one, and though they initially managed to repel the\nattack, the Orcs renewed their assault after nightfall and the men were\noverwhelmed.\n\n\n\nBefore the battle had begun, Isildur had sent away his esquire Ohtar\nwith the Shards of Elendil's sword. Isildur kept the One Ring, but it\nwas useless in defending his men against the Orcs. He realized now that\nhe did not have the strength to wield the Ring and could not even put it\non without great pain to himself. Isildur regretted the foolish pride\nthat had led him to keep the Ring.\n\nIsildur's son Aratan was mortally wounded, and his son Ciryon was\nkilled. His eldest son Elendur begged him to flee in order to prevent\nthe Orcs from capturing the Ring. Isildur agreed and parted with great\nsorrow from Elendur, who was slain leading the remaining Dúnedain.\n\nIsildur put on the Ring though it pained him and headed for the Anduin.\nHe removed his armor and waded into the River intending to try to cross\nit. The current was strong and despite his great strength, it pulled him\ntoward the marshes of the Gladden Fields. Then the Ring left Isildur's\nfinger and was lost in the waters. Isildur initially felt an\noverwhelming sense of loss, but was then relieved as if a great burden\nhad been lifted from him. He rose out of the water, but at that moment,\nhe was spotted by orcs who shot him with arrows through the throat and\nheart.\n\nThe One Ring remained in the Gladden Fields until Déagol found it in TA\n2463. Isildur's body also lay in the waters, undiscovered by his\nkin. While searching for the One Ring, Saruman found the Elendilmir that\nIsildur had been wearing, and some speculated that the Wizard may have\nfound and even burned Isildur's remains in one of his furnaces, but\nwhether this is true is not known.\n\nIsildur's youngest son Valandil became the King of Arnor when he came of\nage in the year 10, but he did not claim the Kingship of Gondor, and\nthe two Kingdoms became separated. Gondor continued to be ruled by the\nheirs of Anarion, while Arnor was ruled by the heirs of Isildur. It was\nnot until the end of the Third Age that the Kingdoms were reunited by\nAragorn, King Elessar, Isildur's heir.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Isildur_'s name is a Quenya word that meant “Devoted to the Moon”.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film trilogy\n\n\n\nIsildur was portrayed by Harry Sinclair in The Lord of the Rings film\ntrilogy, and according to the director's commentary, his one line was\nprovided by Hugo Weaving, who plays Elrond.\n\nVideo games\n\nAmong the video game adaptations, Isildur is playable in _The Lord of\nthe Rings: The Two Towers_ if one completes the game, though he is\nessentially a palette swap of Aragorn. He can be briefly seen in _The\nLord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth_ and also in _The Lord of\nthe Rings Online_, where during a historic “session play” he can seen\ncursing Wild Men who later become Oathbreakers at the Stone of Erech.\n\nIsildur appears in the video game _Middle-earth: Shadow of War_, in\nwhich he is one of the Nazgûl (though this is of course impossible with\nthe established lore). After his death, the Orcs brought Isildur's body\nto the diminished and vengeful Sauron, who put a Ring on his finger,\nreviving him as one of his servants and eventually turning him into a\nringwraith.\n\nAs one of the nine Nazgûl, Isildur was forced to serve the Dark Lord for\nall time until he was defeated and freed by Talion. The ranger later\nclaimed his ring to survive after Celebrimbor abandoned him and\neventually took Isildur's place among the Nazgûl after holding back\nSauron's forces for decades."

    "race": "Elf",
    "text": "LEGOLAS was a Sindarin elf who was part of the Fellowship of the Ring in\nthe Third Age. As he was the son of the Elvenking Thranduil of Mirkwood,\nLegolas was Prince of the Woodland Realm (Mirkwood), a messenger, and a\nmaster bowman. With his keen eyesight, sensitive hearing, and excellent\nbowmanship, Legolas was a valuable resource to the other members of the\nFellowship. He was well-known for becoming friends with the dwarf Gimli,\ndespite their long-held differences.\n\nIt is not known whether Legolas was Thranduil's only son, or whether he\nwas his heir. His age is unknown as well.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\nLegolas was the son of Thranduil, the King of the Elves of Northern\nMirkwood. His mother is unknown\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nLegolas came to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, the great meeting\nheld by the Elf lord Elrond, as a messenger from his father to discuss\nthe escape of Gollum. When the council was choosing the “Nine Walkers”\nto pit against the “Nine Riders,” Legolas volunteered to represent the\nelves, and to become one of the members of the Fellowship that would set\nout to destroy the One Ring.\n\n\n\nDuring their journey, Legolas would stay at the rear due to his keen\neyes. On Caradhras, Legolas was able to run nimbly over the snow,\nleaving behind little imprint, whereas his companions struggled to plow\nthrough it. When Gandalf gave his counsel, Legolas voted against\npassing through Moria. In the morning, the Fellowship was waylaid by\nwargs and Legolas fought for their defense. After the battle, he picked\nup his arrows, save one which was damaged.\n\nGimli quarreled with him in Moria (which was not unexpected considering\nthe ancient quarrel between Elves and Dwarves) - Legolas' father\nThranduil had once imprisoned Gimli's father, Glóin.\n\nHe and Gimli became friends, however, when Gimli greeted the Elven\nqueen, Galadriel, with gentle words. Before the Fellowship departed from\nLorien, Legolas was given a new Galadhrim longbow. While the\nFellowship was travelling over the River Anduin, he used his new bow to\nshoot down a nearby Nazgûl with one masterful shot in the dark.\n\nLegolas and Aragorn sang a song of lament for the fall of Boromir. He\nled the rest of the Fellowship through Rohan when Merry and Pippin had\nbeen taken by the Uruk-hai. During that week, he acquired a grey horse\nnamed Arod, on which he and Gimli would often ride together.\n\nIn Fangorn Forest, Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli were reunited with\nGandalf, now called Gandalf the White. Upon their meeting, Gandalf\ndelivered the messages of Galadriel to them:\n\n\n\nIn the Battle of the Hornburg, Legolas and Gimli engaged in an\nOrc-slaying contest  that Gimli won (the score being 42 to 43,\nrespectively), though Legolas was not jealous, stating, “You have passed\nmy score by one but I do not grudge you the game, so glad am I to see\nyou on your legs.”\n\nIn Rohan, he and Gimli followed Aragorn and Elladan and Elrohir to the\nPaths of the Dead. His horse, Arod, refused to enter the paths, and\nLegolas calmed him. Their company rode on, with Elladan on the last, but\nLegolas turned back and saw the Dead following the Grey Company.\n\nLegolas fought in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields with Gimli and the\nsons of Elrond. After the battle, he and Gimli entered Minas Tirith;\nLegolas sang an elven-song as he walked, and suggested that the place\nneeded more gardens. They met Prince Imrahil and went to the Houses of\nHealing, at which the cries of the gulls at Pelargir and sang a song\nabout his sea-longing.\n\n Silver flow the streams from Celos to Erui In the green fields of\nLebennin! Tall grows the grass there. In the wind from the Sea The white\nlilies sway, And the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin In\nthe green fields of Lebennin, In the wind from the Sea! \n\nAfter the War\n\n\n\nAfter the destruction of the One Ring and of Sauron, Legolas stayed for\nthe coronation of Aragorn II Elessar and his marriage to Arwen. Later,\nhe and Gimli travelled together to Helm's Deep, visiting the Glittering\nCaves, and then later traveled through Fangorn Forest. Eventually,\nLegolas came to Ithilien with some of his people, with his father's\nleave, to live out his remaining time in Middle-earth helping to restore\nthe woodlands that had been war-torn. After Aragorn's death, Legolas\nmade a ship in Ithilien, and left Middle-earth to go over the sea. His\nstrong friendship with Gimli prompted Legolas to invite him to go to the\nUndying Lands; making him the first and only Dwarf to do so.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n\n\nThe name _LEGOLAS_ is a Silvan dialect form of pure Sindarin _Laegolas_,\nGreenleaf. It consists of the Sindarin words _laeg_ (“green”) and\n_golas_ (\"a collection of leaves, foliage, being a prefixed collective\nform of _las(s)_ “leaf”). The Quenya translation of Legolas is\n_Laiqualassë_.\n\nThere might, however, be a certain meaning to his name: _laeg_ is a very\nrare, archaic word for “green”, which is normally replaced by _calen_\n(cf. _Calenhad_, mutated _Parth Galen_ and plural _Pinnath Gelin_) and\nis otherwise almost only preserved in _Laegrim, Laegel(d)rim_ (Sindarin\nform of Quenya Laiquendi), the _Green Elves_ of the First Age. It may be\nthat Thranduil named his son _Legolas_ to at least in part refer to this\npeople, who were remote kin and ancestors of the later Silvan Elves, the\npeople Thranduil ruled.\n\n\nCharacter\n\n\n\nAlthough he lived among them and in their culture, Legolas was not fully\nof the Silvan Elves. As a son of the Elven-king Thranduil, who had\noriginally come from Doriath, Legolas was at least part Sindarin Elf, as\nhis mother's identity is completely unknown. This is complicated by the\nfact that a small minority of Sindarin Elves ruled the predominantly\nSilvan Woodland Realm of Northern Mirkwood, a minority to which Legolas\nbelonged. The Sindarin minority in that realm, who should have been\nnobler and wiser than the Silvan Elves can be seen as having “gone\nnative” at the end of the First Age: after Morgoth was defeated and all\nof the grand Elf-kingdoms of Beleriand were destroyed, they can be seen\nas going back to “a simpler time” in their culture.\n\nLike all elves, Legolas has a great respect and appreciation for nature.\nWhile in Fangorn Forest he longed to return once more in order to\nexplore its wonders more thoroughly. He is kind, and cares greatly for\nhis friends, even Gimli the Dwarf, though it was a rarity for Elves and\nDwarves to express a liking for one another because of their feud. Due\nto his age however, he sometimes seems rather patronizing toward the\nmortals around him.\n\n\nAge\n\nTolkien does not specifically give Legolas' age but many have used what\ndetails Tolkien does give to hazard a guess. There are no known dates\nconcerning Legolas before TA 3018. It's safe to say that Legolas was\nmost likely born after Oropher, his grandfather, moved his people across\nthe Misty Mountains, since in the book he referred to the Ñoldor elves\nas a “strange race”. That would mean he's at most 5000 years old which\nplaces his birthdate in the latter part of the Second Age, at the\nearliest. Legolas is never mentioned in any account of the Last Alliance\nof Elves and Men, so most assume he was born in the Third Age, after\nIsildur took the Ring of Power.\n\nLegolas has never been to Lórien before he travels there with the\nFellowship. Therefore, we can assume that he was not with his\ngrandfather's people when they left Lórien for Northern Mirkwood. Before\nthe Shadow of Dol Guldur fell on Mirkwood in TA 1000, Legolas' people\nspent time amongst their Lórien neighbors. But when the Shadow fell,\nthey “retreated before it as it spread ever northward, until at last\nThranduil established his realm in the north-east of the forest and\ndelved there a fortress and great halls underground.” So it seems likely\nthat Legolas' birth-date was after TA 1000, when the Kingdom of Northern\nMirkwood was created. This would make him younger than any other elf\ncharacter in the series, including Arwen. In the Lord of the Rings\nTrilogy, Legolas refers to his travelling companions many times as\n“children”. Yet when he arrived at Fangorn, he claimed to feel young\ncompared to the forest, saying, “It is old, very old. So old that I\nalmost I feel young again, as I have not felt since I journeyed with you\nchildren.”\n\n\nWeapons\n\nLegolas famously used an Elven bow, as well as a long, white knife. He\nwould prefer to pierce his enemies from afar, but his dagger was\nsometimes used for close combat. In Lothlorien, he was given a long-bow\nof the Galadhrim, which was longer and stouter than those of the fashion\nof Mirkwood.\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nThe Elves in Tolkien's legendarium were often associated as “fairy-like”\nbeings who grew great in stature. However, when Legolas was visually\nrendered as “pretty or lady-like”, Tolkien was “wrathful” and added a\ndescription as Legolas as:\n\n_The Hobbit_\n\nJohn D. Rateliff speculates in _The History of the Hobbit_ that had\nTolkien gone on to finish the 1960 edit of the _The Hobbit_, proceeding\nto add to the Mirkwood scenes, it might have been possible Legolas would\nhave been introduced.\n\n    _If Tolkien’s projected rewriting of our story in 1960 had proceeded\n    as far as the Mirkwood chapters, we might have been able to discover\n    whether he intended to bring Legolas into Mr. Baggins’ story (after\n    all, in the light of later knowledge we can say he would almost\n    certainly have been present at the Battle of Five Armies); there is\n    no sign of it in the admittedly sketchy notes that survive. But even\n    this would hardly have resolved the question of what was in\n    Tolkien’s mind almost thirty years earlier when he wrote The Hobbit,\n    since by that later date he was committed to the decision that\n    Thingol and the Elvenking were two different characters_\n\n\nAppearance in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n\nIn the movies\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n-   _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_\n-   _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nLord of the Rings film trilogy\n\n\n\nIn Peter Jackson's movie adaptation, Legolas' role stays much the same\nas it does in the books, although the bond between Legolas and Gimli is\ngreatly expanded. While Legolas' skill described in the book is mighty,\nthe movie adaptations further exaggerate his combat prowess to near\nsuper-level proportions. Legolas wields his signature weapons of a bow,\nlater a new bow by the lady Galadriel. The signature white knife of the\nbook is replaced with a twin pair of curved fighting knives kept in\npouches belted on his quiver. Legolas wields a Rohirric sword at the\nBattle of Helm's Deep, presumably because his daggers would not be very\neffective from horseback.\n\nIn the extended version of _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the\nKing_ (2003), Legolas is shown to hold his liquor very well. Éomer\nchallenged Legolas and Gimli to a drinking game.\n\nIn the official movie guide for _The Lord of the Rings_, a birthdate for\nLegolas is set to TA 87. This would make him 2931 years old at the time\nof the War of the Ring. Coincidentally, Aragorn was born during the year\n2931 in the Third Age.\n\nDue to a technical mishap involving Orlando Bloom's contact lenses,\nLegolas' eye colour in the films sometimes changes between brown and\nblue. Peter Jackson also filmed, but never used, footage of Legolas in\nhis new home.\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\n\n\nIn _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_, Orlando Bloom returns to the\nrole of Legolas. Although Legolas does not appear anywhere in the novel\n_The Hobbit,_ he has a significant role as the son of the Elven king\nThranduil within their Mirkwood realm. Bloom joins Ian McKellen, Ian\nHolm, Andy Serkis, Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving and\nElijah Wood from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.\n\nAs Thorin and Company are attacked by spiders, Woodland Elves led by\nLegolas and Tauriel help rescue the Dwarves. They take the Dwarves into\ncustody and confiscate their weapons. Legolas' attention is attracted by\nOrcrist, which he recognizes as a sword from Gondolin. Upon reaching\nGloin, Legolas confiscates a locket which showcases his wife and son\nGimli, and speaks insultingly about both of them.\n\nIn the palace, Legolas remarks that Kíli has been looking at Tauriel in\na different way, to which Tauriel only smiles and remarks that Kíli is\ntall for a Dwarf. Later, Thranduil confronts Tauriel and remarks that\nLegolas has grown fond of her and that she should not give him hope\nwhere there is none, since he is the son of a king and she is only a\ncommon woodland elf, even if she is captain of his guard. Later, Legolas\nwatches from the far as Tauriel stands outside Kíli's cell and talks\nwith him.\n\nAfter the Dwarves escape Thranduil's caverns, Legolas leads the Mirkwood\nguard after them. Along the way, they encounter Bolg and his troops who\nhave killed the Elven guards by the bridge and are attacking the doors.\nLegolas and his elves manage to kill most of the Orcs and drive off the\nrest, but Thorin and Company are able to escape.\n\nLegolas and Tauriel return to the palace, bringing Narzug, a hostage Orc\nfor questioning. They interrogate the orc about Thorin Oakenshield but\nthe enemy does not answer properly, prompting the Elven king to slay\nNarzug himself. Thranduil then orders that no one enter or leave his\nkingdom without his knowledge. As Legolas gives out the orders, a\nsoldier informs him that Tauriel has left the forest. Legolas goes after\nher.\n\n\n\nIn Lake-town, Legolas and Tauriel arrive just in time to rescue Kíli,\nFíli, Bofur and Oin from being killed by Bolg. Legolas runs after the\nescaping Orcs, decapitates Fimbul and confronts Bolg himself, using\nThorin's sword Orcrist. Amidst the fight, Legolas has to fight several\nOrcs who intercede, which allows Bolg to escape. After dispatching the\nother Orcs, Legolas, only slightly wounded, takes a horse and pursues\nBolg.\n\nIn _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_, Legolas and Tauriel\ntravel to Gundabad and discover that Bolg is leading a great army of\nOrcs, Trolls, and Bats from the north. They later return to Dale in\norder to warn Thranduil and the other armies. When Tauriel confronts\nThranduil, she is defended by Legolas, who further establishes his\nindependence by accompanying her to warn Thorin, Dwalin, Fili, and Kili.\nLegolas separates himself from Tauriel and assists Thorin by shooting\ndown foes from a tower. When he finds Tauriel being attacked by Bolg,\nLegolas rescues her and confronts Bolg in her stead. After a hard-fought\nbattle on a collapsing tower, Legolas emerges victorious and returns\nOrcrist to Thorin.\n\nAfter the battle, Legolas is once again confronted by his father, who\nallows him to be on his own. Thranduil suggests that Legolas must meet\none of the Dunedain called Strider, and encourages Legolas to learn\nStrider's real name on his own.\n\nWhile at Gundabad, Legolas makes a reference to his mother to Tauriel.\nApparently, she had died during an ancient battle between the Elves and\nthe Orcs, and that there was nothing to remember her by, given how there\nwas no grave, and his father never spoke of the matter. However, before\nLegolas left to find Strider, Thranduil assured him that his mother\nloved him more than life itself.\n\nSpeaking of Legolas' return for _The Hobbit (films)_, Peter Jackson has\nremarked, “He's Thranduil's son, and Thranduil is one of the characters\nin The Hobbit, and because elves are immortal it makes sense Legolas\nwould be part of the sequence in the Woodland Realm.”\n\nAs for his return as Legolas, Orlando Bloom remarked that, “The Elves\nalways steal the show.”\n\nRalph Bakshi version\n\n\n\nLegolas has also been portrayed by Anthony Daniels in the 1978 Ralph\nBakshi animated version of _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\nRadio versions\n\nLegolas was voiced by Frank Duncan in the 1956 radio series, by John\nVickery in the 1979 radio series, and by David Collings in the 1981 BBC\nRadio 4 adaptation."

The campaigns of Brytta\nagainst the Orcs were so successful that when he died it was believed\nthat Rohan was free of Orcs.\n\nHe ruled for forty-four years until his death in TA 2842 at the age of\nninety, and was succeeded by his son Walda.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nHis original name was HAMA and was called LEOF, which was then later\nchanged to Léofa."

    "text": "LÚTHIEN, also known as_' Tinúviel_', was an Elf Maiden of Doriath, the\nwife of Beren Erchamion, and the most beautiful of all the Children of\nIlúvatar to ever live. Her love of the mortal Edain Beren, for which she\nwas prepared to risk everything, including her life, was legendary and\nlamented forever in song and story. She and Beren braved Morgoth's\nhorrors, eventually winning the Silmaril and the respect of Thingol.\nThough their actions later resulted in both their deaths, their deeds\nwon them the pity of Mandos and a second life in Middle-earth.  Her\nromance with Beren was one of the great stories of the Elder Days that\nwere told for many ages after she lived.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly years\n\n And thus in anguish Beren paid for that great doom upon him laid, the\ndeathless love of Lúthien, too fair for love of mortal Men; and in his\ndoom was Lúthien snared, the deathless in his dying shared; and Fate\nthem forged a binding chain of living love and mortal pain. — The Lays\nof Beleriand, “The Doom of Lúthien”\n\nLúthien was the daughter of Elu Thingol, King of Doriath, and his Queen,\nMelian the Maia. Throughout the years before she met Beren, she lived\nas all the Elves of Doriath did: in a state of perfect blissful peace.\nShe was a woman of incomparable beauty and grace, with night-dark hair,\nsparkling grey eyes, luminous skin, and a clear heartbreakingly lovely\nvoice that was said to cause winter to melt into spring - ''“the song of\nLuthien released the bonds of winter, and the frozen waters spoke, and\nflowers sprang from the cold earth where her feet had passed”. ''She\nalso often enjoyed dancing in the woods of the realm to the music of her\ngood friend Daeron's flute. He himself soon came to love her jealously,\nbut she did not return it.\n\nThe Quest for the Silmaril\n\n Lúthien was remembered in\nthe _Lay of Leithian_ as the first Elven woman to have fallen in love\nand married a mortal man, Beren, a Man of the House of Bëor whom she met\nin the woods of Doriath. Their relationship was unlikely from the\nbeginning: Lúthien was not only the cherished single daughter of the\nmost powerful Elven King in Beleriand, but also the daughter of a Maia,\na powerful angelic being of the race of the Ainur. Beren was a mortal\nman on the run from the first Dark Lord Morgoth.\n\n\n\nThingol was desperate not to let Beren marry his daughter, and set an\nimpossible task as the bride price: Beren had to bring to Thingol one of\nthe Silmarils from Morgoth's iron crown. Against monstrous odds, being\nkidnapped by the Sons of Fëanor and the death of Finrod Felagund, as\nwell as a confrontation with Sauron, the couple achieved the task with\nhelp from Huan, the Hound of Valinor, but Beren died as soon as it was\ncompleted. In grief, Lúthien lay down and died, passing to the Halls of\nMandos. There, in her grief, she sang to Mandos. Her song was of such\nbeauty that Mandos, for the first and only time in his existence, was\nmoved to pity. But Mandos had no authority to allow Beren to live again,\nso he went before Manwë for advice, who in turn sought out the counsel\nof Eru Ilúvatar himself. Two choices were then placed before Lúthien;\nshe could either dwell in Valimar with the Valar in bliss forever as\nreward for all that she had accomplished, or she could be restored to\nlife again with Beren, on the condition that they would both be mortal\nand die the death of Men. For her love of Beren, Luthien chose the\nlatter.\n\nLater years\n\n\n\nAfter this, she became a mortal and returned to Middle-earth with Beren,\nand lived briefly in Tol Galen. They had a son, Dior, who was called\nElúchil, the Heir of Thingol.\n\nAfter the sack of Menegroth, Beren returned there and ambushed the\ndwarves and took Nauglamir back to Luthien. Her beauty combined with the\nsplendor of the gem and necklace to make her home of Tol Galen the\nfairest land ever to have existed east of Valinor. On her death the\nNauglamír was delivered to her son Dior, which led to the ruin of\nDoriath.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe union of Beren and Lúthien was the first between a mortal Man and an\nElven maid. Their lineage passed down to the royal House of Elros of the\nKingdom of Númenor, and then on to the Dúnedain, men living in exile in\nMiddle-earth, and on to the Kings of the Reunited Kingdom and beyond.\nLúthien's romance with Beren is one of the great stories of the Elder\nDays, and is mirrored by the later romance between Aragorn and Arwen\nEvenstar. According to legend, her line will never be broken as long as\nthe world lasts.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _LÚTHIEN_ means “Daughter of Flowers”, from the Sindarin _luth_\n(“flower”). In Doriathrin, Luthien and Noldorin _Lhūthien_ means\n“enchantress”, which is derived from _luktiēnē_ (“enchantress”).\n_Lúthien_ may have been derived from the Old English word _Lufien,_\nwhich means “love”.\n\nTINÚVIEL means “Nightingale”, from the Quendian ''tindōmiselde ''. In\nSindarin, it means “Daughter of Twilight”, from _tinnu_ (“dusk,\ntwilight”) and the feminine suffix _-ien_ (“daughter”).\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nLúthien is supposed to have been based on Edith Tolkien, J.R.R.\nTolkien's wife. Edith Tolkien was buried in Wolvercote Cemetery (North\nOxford) and this name appears on her plaque:\n\nEDITH MARY TOLKIEN - LUTHIEN 1889–1971\n\nThe name of Beren also appears on J.R.R. Tolkien's plaque:\n\nJOHN RONALD REUEL TOLKIEN - BEREN 1892 – 1973\n\n\nEarlier versions\n\nIn the various versions of _The Tale of Tinúviel_, Tolkien's earliest\nform of his tale which was published in _The Book of Lost Tales Part\nOne_, her original name is _Tinúviel_, Beren is an Elf, and the\ncharacter Sauron has not yet emerged. In his place, they face Tevildo,''\n''the _Prince of Cats_, a monstrous giant cat."

    "race": "Elf",
    "text": "MAEDHROS, also called MAEDHROS THE TALL, was one of the princes of\nthe Ñoldor, the eldest of the seven Sons of Fëanor and head of the House\nof Fëanor following the death of his father in Middle-earth. He was\nextraordinarily renowned for his skill both as a warrior and as a\ndiplomat. For hundreds of years, he led his House against the forces of\nMorgoth but the Oath that he and his six brothers had sworn to recover\nthe Silmarils constrained him and ultimately led to his death.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nMaedhros was born in Eldamar, probably in Tirion, to Fëanor and Nerdanel\nsometime during the Noontide of Valinor. After the flight of Fëanor from\nTirion in Valinor, he went with his father to Formenos. When Morgoth\nkilled Finwë and stole Fëanor's beloved Silmarils, Maedhros was the\nfirst son to take the terrible Oath of Fëanor to recover the holy\njewels.\n\nMaedhros participated in the First Kinslaying alongside his father and\nbrothers. He was however the only one of Fëanor's sons not to\nparticipate in the burning of the Teleri ships, and in fact advocated\nfor ships and oarsmen to return to Aman to ferry Fingolfin's host.\nAfter landing in Middle-earth, the Ñoldor were attacked by an army of\nOrcs, leading to the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. The Elves were victorious and\nthe remnants of the Orcish army retreated to Angband, pursued by Fëanor\nand a small vanguard. But Fëanor's force encountered a number of Balrogs\nas they approached Angband, and were quickly slain. Fëanor himself was\ndealt a mortal wound by Gothmog, the Lord of the Balrogs, but Maedhros\nand his brothers arrived with a relief force to rescue him. However,\nFëanor died from his wounds shortly thereafter.\n\n\n\nShortly after the Dagor-nuin-Giliath and the death of Fëanor, an embassy\ncame from Morgoth acknowledging defeat, and offering terms which\nincluded the possibility of surrendering a Silmaril. Maedhros did not\ntrust Morgoth, and so went to meet his embassy with more men than agreed\nupon. But Morgoth too had been expecting treachery, and so sent further\nmore troops, including Balrogs. When the two groups met, the Elves were\nquickly slain and Maedhros was captured. Morgoth then sent word to the\nElves that if they forsook their war against him, Maedhros would be\nreleased. But the Elves knew that Morgoth would not honor his word and\nsent no reply. In response, Morgoth bolted Maedhros by the wrist of his\nright hand to the face of a precipice of Thangorodrim. Shortly\nthereafter the host of Fingolfin, betrayed by Fëanor and abandoned in\nAman, came at last to Middle-earth. The people of Fingolfin, harboring\ngreat anger over Fëanor's betrayal, were not welcomed by Fëanor's host\nfor shame, and the two groups remained bitterly divided. But Maedhros's\ncousin Fingon, with whom he had been very close before the sundering of\nthe Ñoldor, set out to free him, both for the sake of their friendship\nand in an attempt to heal the division amongst his people.\n\nThe recent appearance of the Sun and Moon had prompted Morgoth to\nblanket the sky above Angband with nigh-impenetrable clouds of ash and\nsmoke to shield his servants. Aided by this darkness and the fact the\nMorgoth's legions were hiding underground from the newly made lights,\nFingon managed to reach Thangorodrim unmolested. But seeing that he\ncould not enter Angband by any means, he began to sing a song in\ndefiance of the Orcs hiding within Angband. Maedhros heard this song,\nand began to sing with Fingon, and thus Fingon managed to find him upon\nthe slopes of Thangorodrim. But when he reached the foot of the\nprecipice from which Maedhros hung, he found that there was no way to\nreach Maedhros to free him. Seeing that there was nothing Fingon could\ndo to help him and being in agony without hope of respite, Maedhros\nbegged Fingon to shoot him. Fingon made to do as Maedhros wished, but\nbefore he loosed his arrow, he prayed to Manwë to speed the arrow along\nfor Maedhros's sake. Fingon's plea for mercy was heard by Thorondor, the\nKing of Eagles, who stayed Fingon's hand and flew him to Maedhros. But\nFingon was unable to either affect the metal band from which Maedhros\nhung or draw it from the precipice. Maedhros begged Fingon for death\nonce again, but Fingon instead severed Maedhros‘s hand and Thorondor\nbore them both away from Thangorodrim. Maedhros made a swift recovery,\nbut never forgot his torment, which drove him to become an even deadlier\nswordsman with his left hand than he had ever been with his right. In\ngratitude for his rescue, and in atonement for Fëanor's betrayal,\nMaedhros relinquished all claim as the heir of Finwë and made his Uncle\nFingolfin, Fingon's father, High King of the Ñoldor, something his\nbrothers did not take well to. Maedhros openly acknowledged this action\nas being proper however, as Fingolfin was the oldest living son of Finwë\nand was therefore next in line for the throne.\n\n\n\nSeeing that his brothers were likely to cause feuds with their kinsmen,\nMaedhros moved them out of Hithlum, and later ruled the lands around the\nHill of Himring, which became known as the March of Maedhros. He\nestablished there a mighty fortress city not only to separate his rash\nand fiery brothers from the people of Fingolfin, but because he wished\nto have any attack from Angband fall first upon him. Allied with\nFingolfin, he helped the High King win the battle of Dagor Aglareb. He\nstood with Fingolfin for nearly 300 years until the Dagor Bragollach,\nand thanks to his daring deeds during the battle, Himring stood while\nmany other elven realms fell.\n\nSoon after, he learned of Beren and Lúthien's successful quest to\nliberate a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown. Realizing that Morgoth was not\ninvincible, he took hope and gathered his brothers and united with other\nElven Houses to create the Union of Maedhros, hoping to end the dominion\nof Morgoth forever. However, the Union was utterly broken during the\nNirnaeth Arnoediad. Himring was garrisoned by Orcs, and Maedhros and his\nbrothers fled south, taking refuge upon the hill of Amon Ereb.\n\n\n\nSeveral years later, Maedhros and his brothers learned that Elwing of\nDoriath, granddaughter of Lúthien and Beren, had inherited the Silmaril\nthat her grandparents had recovered from Morgoth. Still driven by the\nOath, Maedhros allowed Celegorm to convince him to attack Doriath.\nDuring the battle, Celegorm, Caranthir, and Curufin were slain by\nBeren's son, Dior Eluchil, the King of Doriath, but he himself was slain\nas well. Dior's sons, Eluréd and Elurín, were captured and abandoned by\nCelegorm's cruel servants in the forests around Doriath. Maedhros\nbitterly regretted this deed, and he long searched for the innocent\nyouths but could not find them. After learning that Elwing had\nsurvived and had taken the Silmaril with her, he and his surviving\nbrothers descended with an army upon the remnants of the people of\nDoriath living in the Havens of Sirion. The Ñoldorin princes killed many\nelves and captured Elwing's sons Elrond and Elros in the sack, but she\nand her husband Eärendil escaped to the West with the jewel.\nHeartsick with the burden of the Oath and the deeds he had participated\nin to see it fulfilled, Maedhros and his brother Maglor took Elwing's\nsons under their protection.\n\n\n\nAfter the War of Wrath, he and his last surviving brother, Maglor,\ndemanded the jewels from Eönwë but were denied, as they were judged by\nthe Maia to be unworthy of the jewels due to their cruelty. However,\ndriven onward by the Oath, Maedhros convinced Maglor of the necessity of\nfulfilling it. As such, one night the two brothers snuck into the camp\nof the victorious Host of the West, slew the guard around the jewels and\nlaid hands upon them. The camp was roused, and the brothers prepared to\ndie defending their claim. But Eönwë ordered the brothers to be spared,\nand they left the camp unharmed. But because of the evil deeds committed\nby the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned in Maglor's and\nMaedhros' hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Maedhros cast himself and\nthe Silmaril he carried into a fiery chasm in the Earth.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis father-name was NELYAFINWË (“Finwë the Third”), from the Quenya\n_nelya_ (“third”), and its shorter form is NELYO. \n\nHis mother Nerdanel called him MAITIMO (“Well-shaped one”) for he was\n“of beautiful bodily form”. His first epessë was RUSSANDOL (“Copper\ntop”), referring to his auburn hair. The second epessë MAEDHROS is\nthe Sindarin translation of Maitimo and Russandol, from the Sindarin\n_maed_ (“shapely”) and _ross_ (“red-haired”). The Quenyan MAIDHROS\nmeans “Pale-glitter”.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nMaedhros had a fierce spirit, hardened by his torment by Morgoth on\nThangorodrim, but was more temperate than his father. He was an\nexceptionally skilled swordsman despite the loss of his right hand. He\nwas well known for his handsome, comely appearance, especially his\nauburn hair, which was a contrast with his royal kin's dark hair. He was\nalso known for his skill in diplomacy, as he was able to keep the peace\nbetween the House of Fëanor and the rest of his kinsmen for hundreds of\nyears despite the rash and fiery nature of most of his brothers.\n\n\nGallery"

    "text": "MAEGLIN was an Elf, the son of Eöl the “Dark Elf” and Aredhel daughter\nof Fingolfin. He lived during the First Age of the Sun in Middle-earth,\nand was a lord of the hidden Elven kingdom of Gondolin. He became\ninfamous for his betrayal of the location of the city of Gondolin to the\nDark Lord Morgoth.\n\n\nBiography\n\nAredhel had left Gondolin to wander through Beleriand, and in the woods\nof Nan Elmoth, she met Eöl, and stayed with him, eventually giving birth\nto Maeglin. Eöl gave his child the name _Maeglin_ when he was twelve.\nHis mother told him about Gondolin and its people throughout his\nchildhood and he desired to see his related kin in the Hidden City. He\nand his mother soon grew weary and discontented with their life in Nan\nElmoth and Eöl's strict shunning of the outside world. When Aredhel\nfinally decided to leave Eöl, she took her son (who stole his father's\nsword, Anguirel, forged of meteoric iron) with her and returned to\nGondolin. However, Eöl had followed her, and in judgment before Turgon,\nhe attempted to kill Maeglin with a poisoned dart, but hit Aredhel\ninstead. She died, and Eöl was cast down to his death from the city\nwalls.\n\nMaeglin was now an orphan, but Turgon held him in honor, and Maeglin\nboth learned and taught much. He became an elven-prince held in high\nesteem, even leading his own noble house. He found rich loads of metals\nin the Echoriath surrounding the city and forged weapons of steel\nstronger than had been seen before. His mine in the Echoriath was named\n_Anghabar_, “Iron Mine”. In the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Maeglin refused to\nremain behind as regent, and went forth to battle with Turgon. The\nseventh and final gate of Gondolin, the Great Gate of Steel, was\nMaeglin's creation.\n\nEven though Maeglin was one of the mighty of Gondolin, his greatest\ndesire was to take Turgon's daughter Idril to be his wife. But his\ndesire was in vain, for Idril was his own first cousin, and as such was\nconsidered by Elven society to be too close in kinship with Maeglin to\nallow for any romantic relationship. Additionally, Idril was well aware\nof Maeglin's thought concerning her and despised him for it.\n\nWhen Tuor came, carrying Ulmo's warning of the danger to Gondolin,\nMaeglin sat on the right hand of Turgon and argued against Tuor. The\narguments made by Maeglin were instrumental in convincing Turgon not to\nleave Gondolin despite Ulmo's warnings, which ultimately resulted in the\nnear-complete slaughter of the city's people. Seven years later, Tuor\nand Idril were wed and Idril bore a son, Eärendil, further increasing\nMaeglin's hate. Some time later, Maeglin was captured by orcs while\nseeking for metals outside of the Encircling Mountains. He was brought\nto Angband and taken before Morgoth himself, who knew that Maeglin dwelt\nin Gondolin and was eager to learn its location. He threatened Maeglin\nwith unimaginable torment, and though Maeglin was no craven, he was\ncowed by Morgoth's threats and betrayed the location and weaknesses of\nGondolin in exchange for his freedom. Morgoth was overjoyed to obtain\nthis information, and to further encourage Maeglin and ensure both his\nsilence and his further aid, Morgoth promised him both rule of the city\nand the hand of Idril once Turgon was overthrown. Maeglin assented\neagerly to this bargain. Afterwards, Morgoth released him and he\nreturned to Gondolin without suspicion. When the hosts of Morgoth\nattacked and overran the city, Maeglin sought to capture Idril and\nfought with Tuor on the walls. But Tuor prevailed, and threw him from\nthe wall to his death.\n\nMaeglin was a relatively young elf, being merely 190 years old at the\ntime of his death.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ÎON_ was the first name given to Maeglin, by Eöl, which simply meant\n'son'.  His later and common name _Maeglin_ means “sharp glance” in\nSindarin, with _Maeg_ (in Quenya _maika_) meaning 'sharp, piercing' and\n_glin_ meaning 'gleam'. At birth, Aredhel secretly gave Maeglin the name\nof _LÓMION_, signifying “Child of the Twilight” in the Quenya tongue.\n\n_MORLEG_ was the original and rejected name for him, as found in _The\nWar of the Jewels_.\n\n\nGallery"

This oath took the seven brothers to Middle-earth during the\nFirst Age where they established realms in exile, waged war against the\narmies of Morgoth, fought their own Elvish kind, and eventually brought\nruin upon themselves.\n\nMaglor took part in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and he made the lament\n_Noldolantë_, the Fall of the Noldor, in memory of the terrible\nevent.\n\n\n\nIn Beleriand, Maglor and his brothers followed their father and fought\nin the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. Fëanor managed to disperse the armies of\nMorgoth but pressed on to Angband with his sons. Fëanor was mortally\nwounded and his sons bore his body back to Mithrim. As they drew near\nEithel Sirion, Fëanor passed away after cursing Morgoth thrice.\n\nMaglor and his brothers traveled toward the east of Beleriand. Maglor\nfounded the area between the hills surrounding Himring and Blue\nMountains, called MAGLOR'S GAP. Years later, the dragon Glaurung\npassed Maglor's Gap and destroyed the lands about. Maglor and his people\nfled to Himring to join Maedhros before the Dagor Bragollach took\nplace.\n\nAfter the Dagor Bragollach, Bór's people came into Beleriand. He and his\nsons Borlach, Borlad and Borthand swore allegiance to Maedhros and\nMaglor.\n\nFollowing the taking of the Silmaril by Beren and Luthien, Maedhros had\nformed the Union of Maedhros, an alliance between Elves and Men. Under\nhim, Maedhros' host held the east to draw out the army of Angband while\nFingon and his host would attack from the west. During the Nirnaeth\nArnoediad, Ulfang betrayed the Eldar and Edain. Maglor slew Uldor, son\nof Ulfang. The Union of Maedhros was broken and though the brethren were\nall wounded, none were slain. They escaped to Mount Dolmed in the east.\nAfter the battle, they took a woodland life in Ossiriand.\n\n\n\nMaglor and his brothers learned when Dior, the new King of Doriath,\npossessed a Silmaril and refused to give them the jewel that had been\nwon by Beren and worn by Lúthien. In the Sack of Doriath, Maglor's\nyounger brothers Celegorm, Curufin and Caranthir were killed, and the\nSilmaril was not recovered.\n\nAfterwards, Maglor and his surviving brothers dwelt on Amon Ereb in East\nBeleriand. Hearing that Elwing, the wife of Eärendil, had escaped from\nDoriath with the Silmaril and was now living at the Havens of Sirion,\nthe brothers did not act at once, repenting against their destruction of\nDoriath. But after a time, remembering their oath, they sent messages to\nthe Havens of Sirion that offered friendship while demanding that the\nSilmaril be returned to them. And when these demands were refused, they\nmounted an attack on the Havens with their remaining followers, thus\nperpetrating the Third Kinslaying that resulted from the accursed Oath\nof Fëanor.\n\n\n\nAlthough they won the fight, after spilling much of their kin's blood,\nthey did not obtain the Silmaril for Elwing escaped over the Great Sea\nwith it. After the carnage of the cruel bloodletting, Maglor and his\nbrother Maedhros came upon the two young sons of Eärendil and Elwing,\nElrond and Elros. With so much blood already on his hands, Maglor took\npity on them and would not allow them to be slain. So, in the absence of\ntheir parents, he took them into his household and raised them as if\nthey were his own children.\n\nAfter the War of Wrath, Maglor and his last surviving brother Maedhros\nstole the two remaining Silmarils taken by the Valar from Morgoth, even\nthough initially Maglor tried to dissuade his older brother from doing\nthis. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain\nthe jewels, they burned in Maglor and Maedhros's hands. Unable to bear\nthe suffering, Maglor cast his Silmaril into the sea. Thereafter, he\nwandered along the shores of the world singing laments over the loss of\nthe Silmaril, until he faded from memory, though the circumstances\nand date of his death, if it ever happened at all, are unknown.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis father-name was KANAFINWË, which meant “Strong-voiced Finwë” or\n“Commanding Finwë” from _kano_ (“commanding”). His mother-name\nwas MACALAURË, meaning “Gold-cleaver” from Quenya words _mak_ (“cleave”)\nand _laurë_ (“gold”) , possibly alluding to the power of his\nvoice. _MAGLOR_ is a Sindarin rendering of his Quenya mother-name.\n\nOther Names\n\nMaglor's Old English name is DAEGMUND SWINSERE. Christopher Tolkien\ncannot explain the origin of the name Daegmund, but the Old English\n_mund_ means “hand” and “protection”. The word Swinsere means “musician”\nor “singer”.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn the earliest drafts for _The Silmarillion_, Maglor and the fate of\nthe Silmarils have three different changes:\n\n-   In the first draft, dubbed as S by Christopher Tolkien, it is said\n    that Maglor alone steals the two remaining Silmarils from Fionwe's\n    (Eönwë) keeping. He later casts his Silmaril into a pit, knowing\n    that he no longer has right to it, while Maedhros breaks the\n    retrieved Silmarils and restores the light of the Two Trees of\n    Valinor.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   In the second draft, dubbed as QI, both brothers steal the Silmarils\n    and it is Maedhros (not Maglor) who's persuaded to submit. Maedhros\n    is captured by Eönwë and slays himself. Maglor throws his Silmaril\n    into a fiery pit and wanders singing in sorrow by the Sea.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   In the third and last version, dubbed as QII, Maglor and Maedhros\n    share the same fate as is told in _The Silmarillion_, but here it is\n    Maedhros who finds and saves Elrond."

According to J. R. R. Tolkien most elves could only grow beards\nfrom the “third cycle” of their lives, while Mahtan was an exception in\nbeing only early in his second. It is unclear what these “cycles”\nactually refer to.\n\n\nBiography\n\nMahtan was a skilled smith in Valinor learning the arts of metal and\nstone work under the direction of the Vala Aulë. He wore a copper\ncirclet around his head and was known for his fondness for the metal\nmore than gold. Mahtan passed on his knowledge to his eager pupil and\nson-in-law Fëanor who surpassed his teacher by becoming the greatest of\nall Elven craftsmen. When Fëanor and certain Ñoldor became more proud\nand suspicious of other Ñoldor kin due to the lies of Melkor, and began\nforging weapons and armour of war the first ever in Valinor, Mahtan came\nto regret teaching him given the way he was using his knowledge. Later,\nNerdanel became estranged from her husband and retired back to Mahtan's\nhouse. The servants of Aulë counselled against joining the Revolt of the\nÑoldor and therefore he chose not to rebel and remained in Valinor in\npeace forever after.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _MAHTAN_ seems to come from the Quenyan _mahta-_ (“to handle”),\nreference to the arts and skills of making. His devotion to Aulë had\nearned him the name AULËNDUR (“Servant of Aulë”) from _-ndur_ (“to\nserve”). The earlier form of this name was Aulëndil, which was later\nused by Sauron during his treachery to Númenor. His other name URUNDIL\nmeans “Copper-lover” from _urun_ (“copper”) and _-ndil_ (“lover,\nfriend”). His other epessë _RUSCO_ means “Fox”, a reference to his\nred-brown hair."

First Ruling Steward of Gondor (TA 2050 - TA 2080).\n\n\nBiography\n\nMardil Voronwë was the son of the Vorondil, a great hunter of\nbeasts. During his youth, the position of Steward was already a\nhereditary title. The stewardship had resided with his line since the\ndays of his grandfather Pelendur. Mardil received the title of Steward\non the death of his father Vorondil in TA 2029. His Stewardship began\nduring the last part of the reign of King Eärnil II and throughout the\nreign of Eärnur, Eärnil's son.\n\nDuring Eärnur's reign as king, Mardil was charged with the difficult\ntask of restraining the wrath of Eärnur to fight the Witch-king of\nAngmar, the chief of the Ringwraiths, who accused Eärnur after the\nBattle of Fornost of being afraid to fight him.\n\nThe King of Minas Morgul (one of the titles of the Ringwraith) reminded\nEärnur of this and challenged him at the start of his reign TA 2043.\nAlthough Eärnur wanted to fight the King of Morgul he was restrained\nwith difficulty by Mardil. However, when the Witch King issued another\nchallenge with great insult seven years later in TA 2050, Eärnur would\nnot be restrained and thus Mardil could not stop him from doing what he\nwanted to do. He marched to Minas Morgul and was never seen again.\n\nEärnur did not marry and thus had no children, so Mardil took it upon\nhimself to rule Gondor. There was no one with a clear and unassailable\nclaim to the throne, so the rule of the Stewards was a way of averting\ncivil war. Because the fate of the King was unknown, Mardil made an oath\nto rule until “the King returns”. This oath would be sworn by all of the\nRuling Stewards. Mardil ruled Gondor with a steady hand and earned the\nnickname _Voronwë_, which means “the Steadfast” in Quenya.\n\nDuring his rule, the Watchful Peace began when Sauron retreated from Dol\nGuldur in TA 2063 and went back to Mordor.

    "text": "The MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN or THE MASTER was the original leader of\nLaketown when Bilbo Baggins and his companions arrived. He is described\nas being greedy, but not undeserving of his position in terms of\nintelligence and charisma. In the book, he is portrayed as a close\ncompanion to Bard, the captain of the town archers, allowing him to\nremain in Laketown while the Lakemen recovered from their ordeal with\nSmaug.\n\nIn _The Hobbit_, he is not given an actual name.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nThe Master of Laketown ruled from 2920 to 2941 of the Third Age and he\nwould have been approximately thirty years old when he began\nleadership. This would make him fifty years old at the time of the\nBattle of the Five Armies and The Quest of Erebor, as these events both\noccurred in the year 2941. The Master's rule in Laketown was rather\namicable, and therefore under his dominion the Men of the Long Lake\ntraded peaceably with the Elves of Mirkwood, creating a steady trade\nthat was kept until 2941, when Thorin and his friends came to wrest\ndominion of the Lonely Mountain and its riches from Smaug, who had\narrived 120 years before the Master's rule, in the year TA 2770.\n\nWhen the Dwarves arrived, the Master of Laketown greeted them\ngenerously, but only to keep public spirits up. After the destruction\nof Laketown and the slaying of the dragon by Bard, the townspeople\ndenounced the Master as a coward and called for Bard's ascension as\nKing. The Master, who was an adroit politician, shifted blame for\nLaketown's destruction to Thorin and the Dwarves, who had roused the\ndragon in the first place. This succeeded in turning the townspeople's\nire towards the Dwarves. Bard took the lead in rebuilding the remains of\nthe town and gathering supplies for the coming winter, but was careful\nto act in the Master's name, so as not to usurp the latter's\nauthority.\n\nAfter the Battle of Five Armies, Bard became King of Dale, but gave a\ngenerous portion of his share of the Lonely Mountain's treasure\n(received from Dain II Ironfoot) to the Master, for the re-building of\nLaketown. Unfortunately, the Master succumbed to greed and fled Laketown\nwith most of the gold, and later died of starvation in the wastes, after\nbeing deserted by his companions. He is therefore described as weak,\nbecause he is easily overcome by the lust of the treasure Smaug held,\nand by the dragon-spell.\n\nPersonality\n\nTaking great pride in his power and position, the Master cares only for\nhis own prosperity and gain. His pompous attire manifests as an outward\nexpression of his greed, displaying his wealth for all to see. Harboring\na powerful sense of his own self-importance, the Master dresses his\nguards in regalia every bit as pretentious as his own. Despite his\ndemocratically held position, the Master ruthlessly suppresses all\nchallenges to his authority.\n\nIn line with the book, the Master is shown to have a good head for\nbusiness, a talent expressed in the films through the toll gates he has\nconstructed, and the taxes he has levied. He also displays a keen\npolitical mind befitting someone of his position, recognizing the\narrival of the Dwarves as a way of bolstering his own failing\npopularity.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\n\n\nIn Peter Jackson's adaptation of _The Hobbit_, the Master is played\nby English actor Stephen Fry. In the films, he takes on a more directly\nantagonistic role, presented as a greedy and corrupt public official,\nwhose primary concern rests with retaining his own power and position.\nHe shows little interest in Laketown’s destitute state, instead turning\nhis attention to the acquisition of tolls and taxes.\n\nIn TA 2941, when the growing civil unrest that concerned his leadership,\nand threatened for an election, the Master used a network of informants\nthroughout the city to spy on Bard, as he was jealous of the bargeman\nand was suspicious that he was responsible for the growing threat to his\nauthority.\n\nWhen Thorin and Company are arrested for stealing weapons from the\nLaketown armory, the Master is quick to label them as enemies of the\nstate. However, the revelation of Thorin’s royal linage and his promise\nof a share in the riches of the Lonely Mountain, persuades the Master to\nwelcome the Dwarves, seeing the situation as a chance not only to\nrestore his ailing popularity, but also as a way of increasing his own\nwealth. Providing the Dwarves with weapons and equipment the Master bids\nthem farewell, trusting to their gratitude upon the successful\ncompletion of their quest.\n\n\n\nLater, as Bard attempts to reach the windlance ballista atop the\nLaketown Town Hall, guards sent by the Master arrest him under\nfabricated charges. Bard manages to escape, only to be knocked\nunconscious by the Master himself, who subsequently has him\nincarcerated. His every whim is attended to by his personal assistant\nand councilor Alfrid Lickspittle, who performs tasks that the Master\ndeems beneath himself, such as emptying his chamber pot.\n\nAfter when Bard was arrested under fabricated charges and when the\ndragon Smaug attacked Lake-town, the Master tried to escape on a boat\nwith all of the town's gold as an act of cowardice along with his\nservant Alfrid, the captain of the guards Braga, and a few guards, but\nwhen Smaug was killed by the Black Arrow shot by Bard, his boat,\nhimself, and everyone on it were crushed to death under the weight of\nthe dragon's dead body.\n\n\nLEGO\n\n\n\nMaster of Lake-town appeared in one w:c:lego:LEGO set, 79013 Lake-town\nChase. He also appeared in LEGO The Hobbit: The Video Game as a\nunlockable character. He can be found on a bridge of Lake-town. \n\nNon-canon names\n\nThe Master is given a number of names in adaptations or spin-off\nmaterial, which is not canonical.\n\nIn the play adaptation of _The Hobbit_ by Edward Mast, the Master is\nnamed “Maxwell”.\n\nIn _The Lord of the Ring's Online_, he is given the name “Othur”.\n\n\nTrivia\n\n-   The Master’s affliction with the medical condition Gout as seen in\n    the films is likely a reference to the condition’s historic name –\n    “rich man’s disease”, a reference to the Master’s own financial\n    position."

She married Húrin of the House of Marach. After Dagor\nBragollach, she and her folk moved northeast through the Ered Wethrin\nand after enduring great losses and finally came to Dor-lómin in Hithlum\nand were well received by the folk there. It was here that she and her\nhusband had their three children, Túrin, Niënor Níniel, and Lalaith.\n\n\n\nHúrin went off to fight in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad but never returned as\nthe battle was lost. After the defeat of the Union of Maedhros, the\nsavage Easterlings came to Hithlum to claim their new land as a reward\nfor fighting for the Dark Lord. The Easterlings were cruel and took many\nslaves including the young and old. Morwen resisted the new Easterling\nlords that took over Húrin's land, and sent Túrin away to Doriath and\nthe court of King Thingol, to prevent him from being taken as a slave.\nHowever, none of the Easterlings dared take Morwen's home, for they\nbelieved she was a witch and in league with elves, although she had no\nsuch power. After most of the danger had passed, she went to Doriath\nlooking for Túrin. Niënor followed her against her commands, but she was\naccepted by Thingol.\n\nMorwen was alarmed at not finding her son in Doriath, and after staying\nfor a while she and Mablung left to search for Túrin. Niënor followed\nagainst Morwen's will for a second time. While they sought for Túrin in\nthe forest, Glaurung the dragon came upon them. He gave Niënor amnesia\nwith his dragon magic and left. When Mablung found Niënor, she ran off\ninto the woods, and was not seen by Morwen again. Morwen returned to\nDoriath after this sad incident.\n\n\n\nMorwen met her husband Húrin once again after the death of Túrin and\nNiënor. At their children's grave Húrin found Morwen, ragged, tired, and\nsorrowful. They spoke their last words together, and then Morwen died\nwith the setting of the sun and was buried with her children.\n\nTheir graves remained after the drowning of the Beleriand at the end of\nthe First Age on the isle of Tol Morwen off the coast of Forlindon,\nwhich was no doubt named after her.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name MORWEN is Sindarin for “Dark Maiden”, from _mor_ (“dark”) and\n_-gwenn_ or _-wen_ (“maiden”). Her epithet ELEDHWEN means “Elf-maiden”,\nfrom _eledh_ (“elf”). Eledhwen is interpreted as “ELFSHEEN”.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn other versions, Éowyn of Rohan was given the name “Éowyn Elfsheen\ndaughter of Théoden”."

    "text": "MÎM, or MÎM THE DWARF, was a Petty-dwarf of the First Age and\npossibly the last of the Petty-dwarves. He was mostly a part in the\nadventures of Turin Turambar.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nMîm lived with his two sons at Amon Rûdh in middle Beleriand, where he\nkept a secret treasury. During Túrin's time with the Outlaws, Mîm and\nsons were seen as they snuck past the outlaws carrying heavy sacks. Mîm\nwas captured, and arrows were shot at his sons IBUN and KHÎM.\n\nIn exchange for his life, Mîm was forced to lead the outlaws to his\nsecret halls in Amon Rûdh. There, it turned out Khîm had been killed by\nan arrow loosed by Androg, who was then forced to break his bow and\narrows, and Túrin repenting offered his service to Mîm. For this reason\nMîm tolerated the outlaws, and at the least came to respect Túrin (and\nwas even jealous of Túrin's love for Beleg).\n\n\n\nWhen Beleg Cúthalion arrived at Amon Rûdh, Mîm was angry: he hated\nElves, especially the Sindar. Nevertheless he had to tolerate the elf in\nhis halls. This hatred toward Beleg led Mim to betray Amon Rûdh to\nMorgoth. In one of the first known accounts of a wicked dwarf having an\nalliance with Orcs or goblins. After Amon Rûdh was betrayed to Morgoth,\nAll the outlaws were slain, save Túrin and Beleg. Beleg was left tied up\non the summit of Amon Rûdh by the Orcs, and there Mîm found him and\nattempted to kill him but was scared away by a dying outlaw called\nAndróg. Mîm escaped, but it seems Ibûn was killed by Orcs. Eventually\nMîm made his way to ruined Nargothrond after Túrin had killed Glaurung,\nand took the treasure for his own.\n\nHúrin Thalion, who had seen all that had happened to Túrin with\nMorgoth's eyes, with a band of outlaws. But the folk of Mîm were few,\nand the outlaws filled with the lust of the treasure slew them, though\nHúrin would have stayed them; though he deemed him partially\nresponsible for Túrin's fate (the nature of who killed the dwarf, the\nnature of the treasure, and size of Hurin's band varies in post-humus\nedited \"stories'). With his dying words Mîm cursed the treasure. Húrin's\nband brought the treasure of Nargothrond (but not before most had killed\neach other along the way brought down by the treasures curse), and\nThingol had to send his own men to bring the treasure to Doriath, where\neventually the gold was a reason for the Sack of Doriath and the death\nof Thingol.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nNote that in the published _The Silmarillion_ Mîm hardly appears. His\nrole is much expanded in the _Narn i Chîn Húrin_ as published in the\n_Unfinished Tales_, and in the _Wanderings of Húrin_.\n\nThe earliest and most revised version of Mîm's story is the story of\nhoard of Norgrothond, and has changed several several times. In some\nversions a curse is included, or hinted at, in others there is no curse.\nAs well as differences of when the curse took place (did he curse the\ngold before or after he was given a mortal wound, or both before and\nafter). Other changes include when the Necklace of the Dwarves was made;\nafter the treasure was taken (possibly made from cursed gold), or\nbefore.\n\nIn earlier versions of the _Silmarillion_ as detailed in _The History of\nMiddle-earth_ series, Mîm was a much more evil character, who actively\nbetrayed Túrin. But as Dwarves gradually changed in Tolkien's writings\nfrom evil Orc-like beings to the Dwarves they later became, Mîm's\ncharacter was changed, and in the final texts he is no longer a true\nvillain, but almost a tragic character in his own right. However in The\nChildren of Hurin certain details are taken in a darker direction, with\nMîm actively betraying Turin's company in malice and revenge, and the\nintent to kill Beleg (but only having mercy for Turin (and this mainly\nbecause he also had troubles with the elves)). It it is not nearly as\ntragic, as some of the previously published portrayals (though it does\nmake note that alternate tales are somewhat more sympathetic to the\ndwarf).\n\nMuch of Mim's framework of the original more 'evil' or 'darker' Mim in\nNargothrond is restored in Beren and Lúthien (2017) including the full\nnature of his curse, its influence on Hurin, his allies, the corruption\nof more sinister/greedy dwarves, traitorous elves, treacherous dwarves\nfrom within and without Doriath leading to its downfall, the location of\nThingol's death outside of the Thousand Caves, and dwarves defeat at\nSarn Athrad where bulk of the cursed treasure is lost, and the later\ndownfall of Dior in another Kinslaying. However, as neither Mim nor\nHurin are a focus in the story not all the details of the encounter are\ndiscussed (nor Mim's backstory).\n\nIn the Lost Tales, Mîm is the captain of the guard for Glaurung, who\nprotects his treasures while he is away. He guards the treasures along\nwith other Orcs and possible fallen elves. He curses the treasures with\nwards of protection. Húrin comes, and Mîm warns him of the curse on the\ngold both from the dragon laying on it for long years, and because he\ntoo had put magical wards on it. Only Mîm could safely handle the gold\nbecause he was put in charge of it, and had also bound the gold to\nhimself. Turin feared him at first, but was convinced by his elven guard\nto seize it all. Mîm then put many evil curses on the men. In response\nHúrin killed him as punishment for the cruel behaviour from the dwarf,\nwhen they originally had planned to just take the treasure and leave him\nalone. Mîm issues one final curse as he lay dieing that elves and men\nwould rue the deed, and that death would follow the gold as long as it\nremained on earth (the curse would effect any portion of it even if\ndivided). The elves laughed, but Húrin was bothered by it. They then\ncarried the gold away. The curse did its deed leading men to kill each\nother, elves to kill each other, men killing elves, and Dwarves killing\nelves. Finally it lead to a civil war among the Dwarves that never\nended, even after the gold was lost.\n\nIn the _The Shaping of Middle Earth_, “Mîm the Dwarf” is just a byline\nhe was a random dwarf (though the first dwarf to be mentioned by name in\nthe early histories) who had taken possession Glaurung's gold after the\ndragon had been killed along with other Dwarves of his kind. While there\nhe had enchanted all the gold (a nod back to the black songs and curses\nhe made on the gold as wards while he was the Captain of the dragon's\nguard). Húrin and his band of outlaws come to the hoard kill the other\ndwarven guards, and all slay Mîm, and take the hoard. This changes the\nstory from one person to many taking the gold (though he left out this\ngroup in some later revisions at the time). The curse goes on to lead to\nthe deaths of several factions before finally being lost. Only hint of\nMîm's character comes from the fact that he enchanted the gold (but it\ndoesn't specifically show him to be evil), but his race is however shown\nto be evil when they plot against Thingol (but this is modified in later\nrevisions and stories the Dwarves tend to lean more to sociably neutral\nbut not evil, with the evil ones being categorized under Petty-dwarves).\n\nIn the Lost Road, Mîm is only briefly mentioned in the Annals, similar\nto earlier version; Again Mîm is just a random dwarf (this time\napparently alone) that had taken over Nargothrond hoard. He slew the\ndwarf (there is no mention of any others with him), but the dwarf had\ncursed the treasure, and it is brought to Thingol. Thingol employs\nDwarves to craft him the Nauglamir. Enmity awakens between Dwarves and\nelves, and he sends them away. The Dwarves and Elves from Belegost and\nNogrod return in force and invade Doriath. They were allowed in by\ntreacherous elves who had been smitten by the curse. Thingol is slain in\nthe caves. Dwarves are later ambushed, Beren keeps the necklace, and\ngold is thrown into the river. Later, kinstrife occurs although in this\nversion it is not ascribed to the curse.\n\nThe role of traitor in Turin's band in these early writings instead\ngiven to Blodrin, a Elf that had lived among the evil Dwarves and become\nlike them. The two ideas were later merged into Mîm's character.\n\nMîm is briefly mentioned in The Adventures of Tom Bombadil in regards to\nthe poem, _The Hoard_. The poem itself written by Bilbo apparently;\nappears to be loosely inspired by the stories of the elves, the death of\nMîm, the coming of Glaurung, and the coming of Turin. In this version\nthe old dwarf (apparently Mîm the Dwarf) takes the Elven-home from the\nelves after they fall into shadow, and takes over their hoard. In time\nthe dragon comes to take over his hoard from him destroying him in the\nprocess. Then comes the warrior (apparently Turin) who slays him and\ndies in the process. The treasure is taken by his father.\n\nIn the version published in _Silmarillion_ (1977) the is no reference to\nthe curse, only the Nauglamir is taken from the hoard, and all the\nactions that occur appear to be due to greed and paranoia of all\ninvolved. In cold blooded murder and wicked actions, Thingol was slain\ninside the caves, and the Dwarves working for him steal his treasures,\nand the necklace, and then are later slain themselves.. But it is\nunclear how much of this is an invention by Tolkien or Guy Gavriel Kay.\n\n_The Children of Húrin_ does not go far enough into the story of Húrin\nto reintroduced the curse into the story, though it did reintroduce\ndirect betrayal of Turin's company by Mîm, and other darker details left\nout of the _Silmarillion_ or even the account in _Unfinished Tales_.\nWhile Beren and Lúthien reintroduces the full extent of the curse."

The last remnant of her family\nsurvived through her grandson Celebrimbor, the forger of the three Elven\nRings of Power.\n\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nNerdanel's family is interesting to fans of Tolkien's elves because they\nare the only attested examples of elves with red hair. Nerdanel's father\nMahtan and three of her sons (Maedhros, Amrod, and Amras) are described\nby Tolkien as having red hair (actually a reddish brown) and this is\ndescribed as a trait “of Nerdanel's kin”. Nerdanel's own hair color is\nnever specifically stated, although it is said that she possessed a\nruddy complexion and so it is assumed that Tolkien did indeed intend\nNerdanel to have red hair."

She lived\nseparately near the river that would later bear her name, and spoke only\nher native tongue. The only good thing she saw in Lórien was the Sinda\nAmroth, the King of the Wood. She loved him, and he loved her, but\nrefused to marry him.\n\nAfter the Balrog awoke in nearby Khazad-dûm in TA 1980, Nimrodel grew\neven uneasier in Lórien.

After she and her mother heard a rumour that the\nmysterious Mormegil of Nargothrond was actually Túrin, they set out with\na company of Elves for that place. Unfortunately, the dragon Glaurung\nhad just sacked that Elven city, and, sensing their approach, he caused\na cloud of foul vapor to rise from the Narog. The party's horses\npanicked and Niënor was separated, at which point the worm Glaurung used\nhis famous abilities to put her in a state of total amnesia.\n\n\n\nEventually, the amnesiac woman was found by Mablung, who intended to\ntake her back to Doriath but they were attacked by orcs while attempting\nto cross the Taeglin.

Glaurung then set off his hidden\nweapon against Túrin - he removed Niënor's amnesia with his last words.\nRealising she had married her own brother and was carrying his unborn\nchild, she committed suicide by throwing herself into the ravine at\nCabed-en-Aras. Her death sparked a series of events culminating in his\nsuicide, thus fulfilling Glaurung's vengeance.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_NIËNOR_ means “mourning” and _NÍNIEL_ means “tear-maiden” in\nSindarin."

His hood was purple, he played the flute, and he was very\nfond of regular and plentiful meals like his hobbit friend, Bilbo\nBaggins.\n\n\nBiography\n\nNori was the brother of Dori and Ori. Both Nori and Dori were capable\nflutists, and seem to have carried their flutes with them.  Both these\napparent brothers also shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before\nthe Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in Thorin's home in the\nnorthern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.\n\nThe Quest for the Lonely Mountain\n\nIn TA 2941, Nori and his two brothers became part of Thorin and Company\nbefriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling with him in search of Smaug's\ntreasure in the Lonely Mountain.

He became both Lord of Alqualondë and\nKing of the Teleri.\n\nOlwë was the father of Eärwen and had several unnamed sons. He was\nthe younger brother of Elwë (Elu Thingol) and the older brother of\nElmo. Other Telerin elves such Nowë (Círdan) were said to be akin to\nOlwë.\n\n\nBiography\n\nElwë and Olwë were both lords of the third clan of the elves, the later\nTeleri, and together they lead their people from Cuiviénen to the\nWest. However, during a long wait in Beleriand Elwë disappeared.\nAfter years of searching, Olwë grew impatient, and led the greater part\nof the Teleri to Valinor, on the insistence of the Vala Ulmo.\n\nOlwë became Lord of the island of Tol Eressëa, where the Teleri built a\ngreat number of cities, and grew in number. When they finally came to\nEldamar some centuries later, Olwë became Lord of Alqualondë. His\ndaughter Eärwen married Finarfin son of Finwë and later High King of\nthe Ñoldor in Valinor, and thus their children, when these returned to\nMiddle-earth, could claim kinship to Thingol, for Eärwen had several\nsons.\n\nWhen Fëanor resolved to return to Middle-earth in pursuit of Morgoth, he\ncame to Alqualondë and spoke to the Teleri asking for aid and for the\nuse of the Swanships but he could not move them. He then grew hot and\nwrathful and, grudging he spoke to Olwë, he accused him of renouncing\ntheir friendship and for being ungrateful for the help that the Ñoldor\nhad given his people in the past. Then Olwë said to Fëanor that this was\nnot so and that he believed that as a friend it was right for him to\nkeep a friend from doing something unwise. Then he spoke to him of the\nmany things that they accomplished on their own without any aid from the\nÑoldor, and that the Swanships were one of those things and were very\ndear to them.\n\nSeeing that he was not going to get what he wanted, Fëanor waited beyond\nthe walls until he gathered his strength and then in defiance of Olwë he\nand his people began manning the ships. His people resisted and a battle\nhad begun and many on both sides were slain, but the Teleri withstood\nthem for a time. Then the host of Fingon arrived and believing that the\nTeleri had been told to waylay the Ñoldor by command of the Valar,\njoined the battle and the Teleri were overcome. No doubt Olwë had\nwatched in horror many of his people dying and he could do little for he\ncalled upon Ossë, their patron Maia but there was no answer.\n\nThe cruel slaying at the havens continued to haunt Olwë and his people\nfor many years to come. Towards the end of the First Age when the Valar\nwere preparing for the final assault on Morgoth, the Teleri of Olwë\nagreed only to sail the ships for very few of them were willing to go to\nwar.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIt is mentioned that the name OLWË seems to have no meaning. There are\nprovided “extended” stems such as _olos_ (“dream”) and _olob_ (“branch”)\nbut no connections to the Telerin elf. He was called VOLWË by some\nof the Teleri."

    "text": "ORODRETH was a Ñoldorin Elf of the First Age who was the second ruler of\nthe underground city of Nargothrond in western Beleriand. He was born to\na Noldorin father, Finarfin, and a Telerin mother, Eärwen, in the city\nof Tirion during the Years of the Trees and was the brother of Finrod\nFelagund, Angrod, Aegnor and _Galadriel_. Orodreth had an only child and\ndaughter Finduilas with an unnamed wife. He was later killed in the\nBattle of Tumhalad.\n\nHowever, according to the earlier versions, Orodreth was the son of\nFinarfin's son Angrod and _Eldalótë_. Hence, this made Orodreth the\ngrandson of Finarfin and _Eärwen_ since he was Angrod's son, and he\nbecame the nephew of Finrod, Aegnor, and _Galadriel_. Orodreth's wife\nwas a Sindarin lady of the North, and they had two children: _Finduilas_\nand Gil-galad.\n\n\nBiography\n\nThrough his grandmother (mother) Eärwen of the Falmari (Teleri of Aman),\nhe shared the blood of both the Ñoldor (House of Finarfin) and that of\nthe Falmari (House of Olwë). After the Doom of Mandos was announced\nin Araman, he and the rest of the Ñoldor left for Middle-earth. Even as\nhis grandfather (father) Finarfin and many of his House turned back to\nValinor, Orodreth stayed with his uncle Fingolfin and his host and\npursued his journey to Middle-earth.\n\nOrodreth once held the isle of Minas Tirith in the vale of Sirion\nuntil Sauron overran the isle and turned it into Tol-in-Gaurhoth.\nOrodreth then fled south to Nargothrond.\n\nWhen Beren came to the Kingdom of Nargothrond, King Finrod went with him\non his quest for the Silmaril. However, Celegorm and Curufin, the Sons\nof Fëanor, were also at Nargothrond, and forced Finrod to lay down his\ncrown. Orodreth took it, ruling as regent, but the Sons of Fëanor held\nthe real power. When news came that Finrod had been killed, the Sons of\nFëanor were expelled from Nargothrond and Orodreth became its next\nking.\n\nWhen Túrin Turambar arrived in Nargothrond he gradually became its\nleader and King Orodreth held no actual power, even if he was still Lord\nin name. High in Orodreth's councils, Túrin convinced him to build the\nBridge of Nargothrond and abandon their secretive method of warfare in\nfavor of open warfare. In FA 495, King Orodreth and Túrin marched out\nto meet the hosts of Morgoth and the Dragon Glaurung at Tumhalad and\nOrodreth died fighting there, and his realm was subsequently\nconquered.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _ORODRETH_ is Sindarin for “mountaineer”, which came from the\nword _orod_ (“mountain”).\n\nHis name in Quenya was ARTARESTO, which appears to have come from the\nword _arta_ (“fortress, high”) and _resto_, which have originated from\nthe word _retta_ (“climber”).\n\nInterestingly, if the second part of his Quenyan name did come from\n_retta_, it is easily concievable that the second component of his\nQuenyan name _resto_ was converted into _reth_ when translated into\nSindarin, hence “mountaineer”, or more literally in this case, “mountain\nclimber”.\n\nGenealogy\n\nIn _The Silmarillion_, Orodreth is a son of Finarfin, with the Quenya\nname ARTANÁRO. This was an editorial decision by Christopher Tolkien,\nmade on the grounds that the later revision was not fully integrated\ninto the extant texts by his father. Gil-galad, later High King of the\nÑoldor, was his son, but in _The Silmarillion_, Gil-galad is made into\nFingon's son instead. An earlier idea was that Orodreth's son was named\nHALLAS, but Gil-galad replaced him.\n\nAs the son of Angrod, the earlier name for Orodreth was Artanáro and\nlater changed to Artaresto. After Angrod was slain, Orodreth dwelt with\nFinrod and became his “steward”. Tolkien apparently intended to make\nOrodreth the son of Angrod and the father of Gil-galad. However, this\nwould have impacted a number of other characters and storylines and\ntherefore the change was not made in the published Silmarillion.\n\nIn earlier versions, since Orodreth was described as the son of Angrod,\nit held true then that together with Turgon's daughter Idril and\nCurufin's son Celebrimbor, he was one of the three members of the\nÑoldorin royal family in the third generation to come into exile. His\nfather held Dorthonion, but Gil-galad was sent to the safer Nargothrond\nwith his uncle Finrod.\n\n\nOther Versions of the Legendarium\n\nIn earlier versions of _The Silmarillion_ legendarium as detailed in\n_The History of Middle-earth_ series, Orodreth was a more important\ncharacter, and the original King of Nargothrond. However, his importance\ndiminished over time.\n\nIn his last writings, Tolkien changed Orodreth's name to ARTAHER\n(Quenya) or AROTHIR (Sindarin), but it was never introduced in any\nnarratives, so Christopher Tolkien left the name Orodreth unchanged. It\nis probable the Sindarin name Orodreth would have been retained\nnonetheless: Tolkien seldom changed names after they had long been used,\neven if only in unpublished writings."

After the War of Wrath, he\ndeclined to depart Middle-earth as many others did, and instead went\nover the Blue Mountains with his household. He eventually ended up in\nGreenwood the Great, where Silvan Elves of Nandorin descent lived, and\nhe was taken by them as lord. His capital was at Amon Lanc.\n\nWest of Oropher's realm was the realm of Lórinand across the Anduin,\nwhere Amdír, another Sindar, ruled over Silvan Elves. When Sauron\nreturned to Middle-earth from the Downfall of Númenor and began to grow\nin power, Oropher's folk retreated north of the old Dwarf-Road, and\nlater again north of the Mountains of Mirkwood, where they fortified\nthemselves.\n\nWar of Last Alliance\n\nBefore the War of the Last Alliance, Oropher and his folk left their\ncapital at Amon Lanc and crossed Anduin to live with their kin in\nLórinand. For another three times, he moved his people northward to Emyn\nDuir, the Mountains of Mirkwood. His retreat northwards was because of\nhis desire to move “out of range” from the Dwarves of Khazad-dum.\n\nThough he and his people had little to do with the other peoples of\nMiddle-earth, Oropher understood that there could be no lasting peace\nuntil Sauron was defeated. Oropher answered the summons for the Last\nAlliance of Elves and Men but marched as an independent army with Amdír,\nor Malgalad the then King of Lórien. He joined with Gil-galad's forces\nas they marched down the Anduin to Dagorlad. Oropher's company was\nlightly armed.\n\nIn the Battle of Dagorlad, Oropher's company fought valiantly but he was\nslain with the greater part of his people when he, with King Amdír and\nhis warriors, called an early charge upon the enemy, without orders from\nthe Noldorin High-King Gil-galad. After Sauron was defeated, Thranduil,\nOropher's son and heir, returned to Eryn Galen with the shattered\nremnants of the formerly grand army of his people, back north. Ever\nafter it distressed Thranduil to even turn his gaze south to the\ndirection, and memory, of the horrors of the War of the Last Alliance,\nin which his beloved father fell with many of their people.\nNevertheless, while depleted, their army was still large enough that the\norcs hiding in secret in the Misty Mountains did not dare attack\nthem.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Oropher_ probably means “Tall beech-tree” from _oro_ (“up,\nrise, high”). In Doriath, the term _orn_ refers to trees, especially\nbeeches. The terms _pher_ or _pheren_ both mean “beech-tree”."

He\neffectively ruled the kingdom for one year while observing the claims of\nthe two claimants, Prince Arvedui of Arthedain and the general Eärnil\nwho was victorious in battle against the Wainriders (Easterlings).\n\nPelendur dismissed Arvedui's claim maintaining that the rule of Gondor\nbelonged to the heirs of Anarion, even though Isildur was the High King\nof both Gondor and Arnor before his death. Arvedui also argued, his wife\nFíriel, the daughter of Ondoher should rightfully become Ruling Queen\ndue to the old Númenorean law of accession, which stated the eldest\nremaining child of the king should inherit the throne. Pelendur rejected\nFíriel's claim saying in Númenor, it was peaceful enough to have women\nas rulers. However, the Realms in Exile were constantly under attack and\ntherefore needed a male ruler to lead the armies.\n\nBased on the afore-mentioned data the Council of Gondor, under the\ninfluence of Pelendur, threw out Arvedui's claim and chose Eärnil as\nKing, in TA 1945 defying the Númenórean law of succession, which was\nsaid to be inapplicable in a warring state like Gondor. Although\nPelendur's choice prevented the heirs of Isildur from reuniting the\nRealms in Exile, it may have averted another Kin-strife. Eärnil, the\nvictorious general, had become a hero in Gondor and had the support of\nthe populace for his deeds in battle. Installing Arvedui, a foreigner,\nas king could have stirred up resentment amongst the people of the\ncoastlands and the supporters of Eärnil, who had saved Gondor.\n\nThis political precedent (choosing a Man of Gondor rather than an Heir\nof Isildur with a more direct claim to the throne) is one reasons for\nAragorn's caution in assuming the throne of Gondor at the end of the\nThird Age.\n\nWith the accession of King Eärnil in TA 1945, Pelendur handed over rule\nof Gondor to King Earnil II, and resumed the traditional duties of the\noffice of Steward willingly, unlike his descendant Denethor II several\ncenturies later.

As one of the “Lambengolmor”, he was known as the _Sage of the\nÑoldor_, and counted as the greatest Loremaster since Fëanor and Rúmil.\nHe was also the tallest of the Elves of Gondolin.\n\nPengolodh escaped the sack of the city with Tuor and Idril's company of\nsurvivors, and followed them to the Mouths of Sirion. He is not further\nmentioned in writing, but since the Annals of Beleriand are attributed\nto him, as well as the edited Annals of Aman (furthering the work of\nRúmil), he must have stayed in Lindon for at least a while after the War\nof Wrath, so that the Dúnedain could copy his work.\n\nIt was during his stay at the Mouths of Sirion that Pengolodh did the\nmajority of his work. Basing on information obtained from the refugees\nof Doriath, he made copies and extracts of documents written in Cirth,\npossibly preserving them as an active writing system.\n\nSecond Age\n\nLater, in the Second Age, he lived in the Ñoldorin kingdom of Gil-galad\nin Lindon. Pengolodh was one of the few Elves admitted into Khazad-dûm,\nwhere he might have learned Khuzdul. Pengolodh left Middle-earth during\nthe War of the Elves and Sauron and after the fall of Eregion, and left\nfor Tol Eressëa, last of the Loremasters to leave Middle-earth.

Centuries later, Ælfwine spoke with him\nthere.\n\n900 A.D\n\nWhen Ælfwine discovered the island of Tol Eressëa (c. 900 A.D.) he was\ntold stories by Pengolod or studied his works (and those collected by\nPengolod from other authors both elves and men) and translated them.\n\nPengolodh's collection also included the writings of Rúmil and Dírhavel.\n\n\nCanon\n\nPengolodh's only appearance is in the _The History of Middle-earth_,\nwhere he is said to be the author of many works, including the Annals of\nBeleriand, a work which was developed by Tolkien at the same time as\n_The Silmarillion_, and from which Christopher Tolkien drew much\ninformation to establish the published _Silmarillion_. Various late\nessays by Tolkien dealing with linguism are presented as being the work\nof Pengolodh also, including the essay _Quendi and Eldar_.\n\nEarly Tolkien texts stated that, after Pengolodh moving to Tol Eressëa,\nthe figure of Gilfanon, which fulfilled a similar role as a chronicler\nof the annals of Beleriand in earlier works, likely became this\ncharacter as well in Tolkien's mind.\n\nPengolodh (or by proxy Ælfwine) is the narrator for most of the\nmaterials that make up the published _Silmarillion_, either as the\nactive story-teller/mentor teaching Ælfwine or via Ælfwine's translation\nof Pengolod's writings. In the final version, Christopher Tolkien\nremoved most of the references to both of them.\n\nChristopher Tolkien notes in _The Peoples of Middle-earth_ that in the\nfinal version of Akallabêth, written by his father, the work is written\nin the voice of Pengolodh, and that the story was originally addressed\nto Ælfwine by him.\n\n    The authentic text began:  “Of Men, Ælfwine, it is said by the Eldar\n    that they came into the world in the time of  the Shadow of Morgoth\n    ...”\n\nChristopher then admits that this removal made the whole source lose its\nanchorage in Eldarin lore, and he believed he used poor judgment and\nexcessive vigilance, which also led him to alterations of the end of the\nparagraph (perhaps editorial work that was not his to properly make, as\nhe went against his father's original intent). Christopher also points\nout that the last paragraph of Akallabêth, as published in _The\nSilmarillion_, still contains indirect references to Ælfwine, the\n'straight road' and other 'future mariners', which he never altered or\nremoved.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe many spellings of his name are _Pengolod_, _Pengoloð_, _Pengoloth_,\nand _Pengoloþ_—the ending in all cases representing the Voiced dental\nfricative. The name Pengolodh was a Sindarized form of his Quenya name\n_QUENDINGOLDO_."

In FA 455 the Dagor Bragollach broke out, and\nFingolfin, High King of the Ñoldor, summoned him to the war against\nMorgoth. Sador arrived at the battle too late, but came soon enough to\ncarry the bier of Hador, his lord. He decided afterward to become a\nsoldier. In FA 462, he defended Barad Eithel, and soon after stopped\nbeing a soldier. He began woodworking again, but misfortune was his lot,\nfor he accidentally cut off his right foot with an axe.\n\nSador found service with Húrin, and was a woodcrafter for him. He met\nTúrin, and was given the name LABADAL, which translates to 'HOPAFOOT' in\nthe Sindarin tongue. This name was not given in scorn, but pity. Túrin\nalso gave Sador the elven knife that he received for his birthday. Sador\nwould craft carvings of men, beasts, and other things, and teach Túrin\nmorals.\n\nMorwen, Húrin's wife, was not fond of Sador. She said that he did not\nwork fast, and spent too much time “on trifles unbidden”. However, Húrin\nwas moved by Túrin's pity for Sador, and gave him the task of carving a\nchair for his hall.\n\nBefore the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Húrin left to go to war. Sador began\nserving Morwen. Sador did not fight in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears,\nand was dismayed that he could not do so, and “die a valiant death.”\nWhen Túrin left to go to Doriath he first talked to Sador. Sador talked\nwith Túrin about the necessity of his departure. Túrin was sad, but\nunderstood. Sador urged him to take back the elven knife. Túrin refused,\nsaying that he would get many things like it in Doriath.\n\nSador stayed in the house of Morwen for a long while but after the loss\nof the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, he was enslaved by the Easterlings just like\nthe rest of the Men of Dor-lómin. After thirty years, Túrin\nreturned from Doriath and Nargothrond, now a very tall man. Sador (who\nwas now old) met Túrin at Aerin's house, and participated in a rebellion\nagainst the Easterlings (led by Brodda) that had taken over the area.\nDuring the uprising, Sador was fatally wounded by the enemy. He was,\nhowever, able to say his final words to Túrin before perishing.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Sador_ is a Sindarin word which meant “steadfast, trusty, or loyal”."

They encountered Ted\nSandyman at the New Mill. Ted laughed at their dismay at the destruction\nthat had been done to Hobbiton, and he said that if they touched him he\nwould report them to the Chief. When Merry told him that the Chief's Men\nhad been defeated and that the Chief was about to be removed, Ted was\nshocked. He sounded a horn to raise the alarm, but Merry responded by\nsounding the Horn of the Mark, and Hobbits from all over Hobbiton\nresponded.\n\nIt is not known what became of Ted when the mill was torn down."

    "text": "TAR-MENELDUR was the fifth King of Númenor. His two older sisters were\nSilmariën and Isilmë. During his time the Númenóreans began to return to\nMiddle-earth, and great fleets of ships were built to explore all the\nlands east of Númenor.\n\n\nBiography\n\nTar-Meneldur succeeded his father, Tar-Elendil, because the rules of\nsuccession did not allow women to rule, per the principle of agnatic\nprimogeniture. Had the principle of equal primogeniture been followed\ninstead, control of the throne would have passed to Silmariën.\n\nTar-Meneldur married Almarian and had three\nchildren: Tar-Aldarion, Ailinel, and Almiel.\n\nDuring the rule of Tar-Meneldur, contact with the Middle Men of Eriador\nwas reestablished under guidance of the elves of Lindon under Gil-galad.\nTar-Meneldur encouraged the seafarers, and allowed his son Aldarion to\nestablish a guild of seafarers, which became one of the most powerful\norganisations in Númenor. Many voyages along the coasts were made at\nthis time, and the first settlements were made in Middle-earth by\nNúmenórean explorers, although none of them permanent yet. These early\nsettlements were however the later cores of Arnor and Gondor, and the\nreestablished contact of Númenóreans with their distant kin allowed the\nAdûnaic tongue to merge with local, far akin languages, eventually\nleading to the Westron speech. This would in later years prove to be one\nof the greatest assets to the power of Númenor in Middle-earth.\n\nNear the end of Tar-Meneldur's rule reports came that evil had begun to\nstir in the east of Middle-earth (the first awakenings of Sauron, as was\nlater learned), and Gil-galad requested the aid of Tar-Meneldur.\nRecognizing his son Aldarion was more aware of the troubles, and was a\npowerful leader of men, Meneldur abdicated in favour of his son far\nearlier than was expected.\n\nOn the family front Meneldur, together with his wife Almarian, attempted\nto mediate between his son Aldarion and Aldarion's betrothed Erendis,\nwho had become estranged. For a time they were successful, and Aldarion\nand Erendis were wed, but Aldarion soon left again for sea. It was\nduring his long absence in Middle-earth, a time during which Aldarion\nwas instructed by Gil-galad, that Erendis left the royal court for her\nhome. By the time Aldarion returned even Meneldur's best attempts could\nnot heal the breach.\n\nMeneldur was a lover of star-lore and enjoyed watching their motions.\nFor this purpose he built a tower in the north of Forostar.\n\nMeneldur died in SA 942 after a rule of 143 years, at the age of 399\nyears.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nMENELDUR means “Servant of Heaven” in Quenya.\n\nOther Names\n\nHis other names ELENTIRMO and IRIMON meant “the Heavens” and “Star\nWatcher” also in Quenya."

At some point in the fighting, his\nshield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a\nshield, he gained the epithet “Oakenshield,” which would remain with him\neven in death.\n\nThorin eventually became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk after his father\nwent missing, and presumably died in the dungeons of Dol Guldur.\n\nQuest for the Lonely Mountain\n\nIn TA 2941, after receiving a map\nhis father had drawn for him and following advice from Gandalf the Grey,\nhe took a contingent of Twelve Dwarves to visit Bilbo Baggins in order\nto hire him as a burglar for their cause. Thorin's intent was to\ninfiltrate the Lonely Mountain and steal back the treasure from\nSmaug.\n\nThe Dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf experienced a number of dangers on their\njourney to the Lonely Mountain, surviving Trolls, Orcs, Wargs, and\nSpiders. He found the legendary sword, Orcrist, in a troll-hoard along\nwith Glamdring. In Rivendell, the Company rested and Elrond\ntranslated the moon runes in Thror's Map. During their journey\nthrough Mirkwood, Thorin and his Company encountered spiders and were\nlater imprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil. They escaped through\nbarrels and they traveled down to Lake-town.\n\nThorin and Company were greeted warmly by the people of Lake-Town and\nhailed the return of the King under the Mountain. They soon reached\nthe Lonely Mountain and the Dwarves sent Bilbo who converses with\nSmaug. Realizing that the Lake-Men must have helped the intruders, an\nenraged Smaug flew towards Lake-town to take revenge on the Lake-Men.\nThere he was killed by Bard the Bowman who pierced the bare spot on\nSmaug's left breast.\n\nFollowing the death of Smaug, the people of Laketown asked Thorin for a\nshare of the treasure, as they wanted recompense for the destruction of\ntheir city, a part of Smaug's treasure originated from their former\ncity, and it was a lord of Lake-Town, who shot the fatal arrow that\nkilled Smaug. Thorin, overwhelmed by greed after recovering his family's\nriches, and enraged by the presence of Thranduil, refused to share any\npart of the treasure. Instead, he sent a raven to seek aid from his\nrelative, Dáin II Ironfoot, who had a legion of Dwarven soldiers on the\nmove to secure the reclaimed mountain city.Meanwhile, Thorin charged\nhis companions with looking for the Arkenstone within the hoard of\ntreasure. However Bilbo had already found the Arkenstone, and\nsubsequently, secretly brought it to Bard and Thranduil to use as a\nbargaining counter. When Thorin learned of Bilbo's actions he became\nenraged and denounced his former companion as a traitor.\n\n\n\nThe growing conflict over the treasure between Dwarves, Wood Elves, and\nMen, likely to result in bloodshed, was suddenly averted by the approach\nof Goblin and Warg armies, so they instead joined forces to defeat their\ncommon enemies in what was later called the Battle of the Five Armies.\nDuring the battle, Thorin led an assault that proved his strength as a\nleader, striking out from the mountain and providing vital aid as the\ngoblins threatened to overwhelm their foes. He fought courageously, but\nwas mortally wounded in the battle, requiring Beorn to take him to\nsafety.\n\n\n\nBefore he died, he made his peace with Bilbo by commending the Hobbit's\nbravery and good character, apologising for his harsh words as he now\nrecognised his comrade's fundamentally benevolent motives. His last\nwords are, “If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded\ngold, it would be a merrier world. But, sad or merry, I must leave it\nnow. Farewell.”\n\n\nPersonality\n\nThorin was smart, proud, brave, intelligent, vengeful and a bit\nstubborn. He was infamous for a high sense of importance and rank, but\nvalued very nearly every individual of any status. He was extremely\nnoble and highly respectable with a flair of vanity about him. He was\nrespected by many throughout middle earth.\n\nHe shared the greed of his family and had an extensive love for gold,\nthough he valued the welfare of others as well. He was immensely brave\nand was willing to give himself up for any just cause, though this may\nbe to a limit since the upcoming of the Battle of the Five Armies might\nhave come as an exception.\n\nUntil the time of his death, he seemed to be cruel, stubborn and vain,\nand had a very high opinion of value. He was obsessed with possession of\nthe Arkenstone, since it was the heirloom of his family and part of the\nMountain itself.\n\n\nWeapons\n\nThorin fought using typical Dwarven axes, a bow, and swords as well as\nan Elven blade called _ORCRIST_, which he had discovered on the journey\nto the Lonely Mountain. Under Thranduil's imprisonment, the blade\nhad been confiscated by the Wood Elves. At Thorin's burial, Thranduil\ndecided it was more appropriate to place it on Thorin's tomb, and did\nso, along with the Arkenstone.\n\nIn Peter Jackson's trilogy, Thorin begins his quest with his sword, axe,\nand Oak-branch shield. He wielded his sword, Deathless, against the\nTrolls, but was forced to surrender, when the Trolls threatened kill\nBilbo. Thorin later recovered his sword after Gandalf saved them. Later,\nThorin discovered an elven blade in the Troll's hoard. Reluctant at\nfirst, Thorin later keeps the blade when Gandalf tells him that it would\nbe the best he could find. It is unknown what happens to his original\nsword, but it is presumed that he left it in the Troll hoard, as it is\nnot seen again after that. Thorin wields the sword during the orc chase,\nand slays a warg with it. When the company travels to Rivendell, Elrond\ntells Thorin that his sword's name is Orcrist. While traveling from\nRivendell to the Misty Mountains, Thorin's axe is seen as more of a\nwalking axe, then a battle axe. After the company is captured by\nGoblins, Orcrist is taken by them. When the dwarves are brought before\nthe Goblin king, Grinnah finds Orcrist, alerting the other Goblins of\nit's presence, and orders the dwarves' execution over it. When Gandalf\nsaves the dwarves, Nori gives Orcrist to Thorin, which he injures the\nGoblin King with. It is presumed that when the dwarves escape, Thorin\nloses his axe, as it is not seen again. In his battle against Azog,\nThorin uses Orcrist and his Oaken-branch against him. When the eagles\nsave the group, Thorin drops his Oaken-branch, as an eagle picks him up.\nThorin is not seen using Orcrist until Mirkwood, where he uses it to\nslay many spiders, until Mirkwood elves capture them. Legolas\nconfiscates Orcrist, and the company is captured. When the dwarves\nescape from the orcs in the barrel chase, Thorin takes swords and axes\nfrom the orcs, dropping them as he slays the orcs. After the company\ngets help from Lake-Town, Thorin uses a sword when they get to the\nLonely Mountain. In the Battle of the Five Armies, Thorin fires a\nwarning shot at Thranduil, telling him not to approach him. Thorin leads\nthe company into the Battle of the Five Armies with a sword and a\nshield, with which he slays many orcs. Thorin briefly fights Azog on\nRavenhill, where he fends off a pack of Goblin mercenaries with a\ndagger, and the help of Legolas. In the final battle, Thorin fights Azog\nwith Orcrist, which he recovered from Legolas. Azog attempts to stab\nThorin, but is prevented when Thorin uses Orcrist to block his blade. In\nthe end, Thorin gives in, and is stabbed by Azog. However, Thorin\nimpales Azog back, and thrusts Orcrist into him so hard, that the blade\npierces the ice beneath them. At his funeral, Thorin is buried with\nOrcrist, along with the Arkenstone.\n\n\nAbilities\n\nThorin was a fierce and formidable warrior, highly skilled in both\nswordsmanship and archery.  \n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nRankin/Bass films\n\nIn the 1977 animated version of _The Hobbit_, Thorin is voiced by Hans\nConreid.\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\n\n\nIn the 2012, 2013, and 2014 live-action films, Thorin is portrayed\nby Richard Armitage. The studio released the following statement about\nThorin in the trilogy:\n\nIn _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,_ Thorin has a long standing\ngrudge with King Thranduil for not helping his grandfather save Erebor\nfrom Smaug and for not offering any aid to the refugees afterward. This\nmakes him extremely bitter toward the elves to the point that he almost\nrejected Orcrist upon discovering it. Thorin is also seen wielding a\nshort sword called 'Deathless' during the first part of the movie as\nwell as a metal battle-axe\n\nA sub-plot in _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_ (2012) is the orc\nwarlord Azog's pursuit of Thorin, to wipe out the line of Durin. In\ncontrast to Tolkien's mythos, in which Dain Ironfoot beheaded Azog long\nbefore the events of _The Hobbit,_ in the movie Thorin slices off Azog's\narm at the Battle of Azanulbizar and Azog survives to pursue Thorin and\nCompany for revenge during The Quest of Erebor.\n\nAs seen in the first film, Thorin earns his epithet _Oakenshield_ during\nhis fight against Azog at the battle of Azanulbizar where he used an\noaken branch as both a weapon and shield. In the second film, Thorin has\nOrcrist taken from him by Legolas following the battle with the spiders\nof Mirkwood and the party's capture by the wood elves. Thorin would\nlater obtain a human long sword for the raid on Erebor from Lake Town's\narmory.\n\nIn the first two films, Thorin is seen with different kinds of weapons\naside Orcrist; he wields an axe, swords, bow, and an oaken branch.\n\nIn the films, he is portrayed rather friendly, but hostile to the Elves\nand suspicious of Bilbo. However in film two, he becomes more determined\nto gain the Arkenstone and the treasure. This led to him becoming\nincreasingly determined to have it, even willing to let Bilbo die rather\nthan risk the quest fail. When Balin realized that Thorin was not\nhimself, he believed that the sickness had fallen onto his companion and\nconvinced him to enter. When he learned that Bilbo didn't have the\nArkenstone, he menacingly walked towards him and put the sword out\ntowards him, as if he intended to kill him, only to be stopped when he\nnoticed Smaug.\n\nIn the final film, Balin recognises that Thorin has utterly succumbed to\ndragon sickness, and confides this tearfully to Bilbo. Thorin even\nbegins to talk like Smaug, slowly, stressing sibilant syllables. He\nrepeatedly berates and shouts at his followers, almost strangling Bilbo\nto death on the revelation that he gave the Arkenstone to Bard and\nThranduil and later banishes and threatens to kill Dwalin. When the\nbattle breaks out, he refuses to help the elves, men of Dale, or even\nhis cousin Dain against the Orcs, and he barricades himself in the\nmountain, along with his company, who by now clearly follow his orders\nout of loyalty alone rather than love.\n\nHowever, he eventually comes to his senses after experiencing a\nhallucination of Smaug underneath a solid gold floor created from their\nattempt to kill him, casting off his grandfather's crown and robes, he\nleads his relieved company to reinforce Dain's forces who rally around\ntheir rightful King and push back against the Orcs. It becomes clear,\nhowever, that they are nonetheless outnumbered, and the departure of\nKing Thranduil renders the defenders even weaker. Thorin decides to take\nhis best warriors, Dwalin, Kili and Fili, and go to Ravenhill, intending\nto kill Azog and plunge the Orcs into disarray, perhaps securing\nvictory. However, upon finding the Orcish command post upon Ravenhill's\nruined towers seemingly abandoned, Thorin, wary of the situation, sends\nFili and Kili to scout the towers, warning them not to engage. Bilbo\nthen arrives, too late, warning Thorin that he is caught in an ambush.\nFili is trapped by Orcs and turned over to Azog, who reveals himself to\nThorin, impaling Fili and throwing him from the top of one of the\ntowers. Thorin enters, intending to rescue Kili, who is instead impaled\nby Bolg. Thorin himself only survives due to assistance from Legolas,\nwho kills Bolg. Thorin finally shows down with Azog on the edge of a\nfrozen waterfall. Wielding a brick on a chain as a morning star, Azog\neventually smashes the ice, only to fall into the water and seemingly\ndrown due to the weight of his own weapon. However, Azog floats back to\nthe surface, and stabs Thorin in the foot from under the ice. While he\nis incapacitated, Azog re-emerges, fatally wounding him in the chest,\nonly to be stabbed by Thorin in turn, who completely impales Azog,\nkilling him immediately. Thorin survives long enough to be found by\nBilbo and has time to make peace with Bilbo and say final farewell\nbefore succumbing to his wounds. The surviving members of the company\nlater kneel by his body as a mark of respect.\n\nRadio\n\nIn the BBC's _The Hobbit_ 1968 radio series, he was voiced by John\nJustin and by Tom Luce in the 1979 radio series done by The Mind's Eye."

    "lotrUrl": "https://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Thranduil",
    "race": "Elf",
    "text": "THRANDUIL, son of Oropher, was an Elven king who ruled over the Woodland\nRealm in the Second and Third Ages. Though inherently cautious, he\neventually committed his kingdom to fighting against Sauron in the War\nof the Ring. He was the father of the Elven prince of Mirkwood, Legolas,\nwho was a member of the Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nIn _The Hobbit_, Thranduil is only referred to as the ELVENKING.\n\n\nBiography\n\nFirst and Second Ages\n\nThranduil was the only son of Oropher, the King of the Woodland Realm.\nHe was born sometime during the First and Second Age. At the beginning\nof the Second Age, the Sindar travelled east and Oropher eventually\nfounded Greenwood the Great.\n\nIn SA 3434, Thranduil and his father fought in the Battle of Dagorlad.\nOropher was slain and Thranduil returned to Greenwood with roughly a\nthird of the army that had marched to war. He claimed his inheritance\nand some time before TA 1000 inherited Oropher's title of King of the\nWoodland Realm, reigning over the south of Greenwood the Great. \n\nThird Age\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of Thranduil's reign his kingdom encompassed all of\nGreenwood the Great and was known as the Woodland Realm, but as the\nThird Age progressed, the shadow of the Necromancer advanced, and the\nGreenwood grew dark and became known as Mirkwood, and became infested\nwith Orcs and giant spiders. The Wood-elves of Mirkwood were reduced in\nnumber and retreated to lands in the north of Mirkwood. By the time of\nthe events of _The Lord of the Rings_ Thranduil's title was _King of the\nElves of Northern Mirkwood_.\n\nIn his realm, both Sindarin and Silvan Elvish were spoken, though not\nall members of his Woodland folk spoke Sindarin.\n====The Quest of Erebor====\n\nWhen Thorin Oakenshield and his party of Dwarves entered northern\nMirkwood, Thranduil captured Thorin and locked him up in a secure room\nwhen he refused to divulge his true intentions. The Dwarves were\ntreated well, with plenty of food and drink. Subsequently, when the rest\nof the Dwarves had been captured by the elves, Thranduil had them\nunbound and treated them as his guests (save that they were not allowed\nto leave the caverns), until they angered him by being surly and\nimpolite, insulting him for keeping them as prisoners, and not revealing\nwhy they had entered the forest, after which he gave them each their own\ncell. He did not tell them that Thorin was also his prisoner.\n\n\n\nAfter the death of the Dragon Smaug, Thranduil supported Bard the\nBowman's claim of a share of the treasure the dwarves recovered from the\nLonely Mountain, since Bard was a descendant of Lord Girion of Dale, and\nthe treasure of that town had been taken by Smaug to the Lonely\nMountain.\n\nThranduil led the elven forces in the Battle of the Five Armies. His\narmy was position on the southern side of the Mountain, and was the\nfirst to charge.\n\nAfter the battle and of Thorin's death, Thranduil took Orcrist, which\nwas previously confiscated in Mirkwood, and laid it upon Thorin's tomb.\nThe treasure was divided among Elves and Men, and Thranduil received the\nemeralds of Girion. Bilbo, Gandalf and Beorn traveled with the elf-host\nback to Mirkwood but would not stay in the woods, even when Thranduil\nasked them to.\n\nWhen Bilbo and Gandalf bade farewell, Bilbo gave Thranduil a necklace of\nsilver and pearls. The king gave Bilbo the title of “elf-friend” and\nreturned with his host in their halls.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, he sent his son Legolas to Rivendell, along\nwith other Elves, to report Gollum's escape from Mirkwood. The\ngradually-established friendship between the dwarf Gimli and Legolas\nlater helped to reconcile Thranduil's people with the Dwarves.\n\nWhen the forces from Dol Guldur later attacked Mirkwood, Thranduil\nrepulsed an attack and had the victory. His actions were in concert with\nthe Dwarves and the Men of Dale against the Easterlings who attacked\nfrom the East. He came into an agreement with Celeborn that the southern\npart of Mirkwood would be counted as East Lórien. Thranduil took the\nnorthern region as far as the mountains; the wide forest between\nMirkwood and East Lórien was given to the Beornings. By this time also,\nThranduil renamed Mirkwood _Eryn Lasgalen_, the Wood of Greenleaves.\n\nFourth Age\n\nAfter the fall of Sauron, Thranduil fixed the southern boundary of his\nrealm as the Mountains of Mirkwood, and his realm flourished well into\nthe Fourth Age. He may have stayed on as the king of the Great\nForest or left Middle-earth and departed to the Undying Lands.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_THRANDUIL_ is a Sindarin word for “Vigorous spring”, from _tharan_\n(“vigorous”) and _ethuil_ (“spring”). It was said that the name\n“Thranduil” was of Lemberin language (later Avarin or Telerian), along\nwith other Sindarin names such as Legolas, Nimrodel, and Amroth among\nothers.\n\nTitles\n\nThranduil first appears as a character in _The Hobbit,_ where he is not\nnamed. Tolkien refers to him as _the elf-king_ or _the king,_ and\nalso by the titles ELVENKING and KING OF THE ELVES OF THE WOOD. The\nname _Thranduil_ first appears in _The Lord of the Rings,_ in which his\ntitle was given as the KING OF THE ELVES OF NORTHERN MIRKWOOD.\nElsewhere in Tolkien's writings he was also referred to as KING OF THE\nWOODLAND REALM, a title he inherited from his father.\n\n\nAppearance in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Silmarillion_\n-   _Unfinished Tales_\n-   _The History of Middle-earth_ (Mentioned only)\n-   _The Hobbit_ (First appearance)\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_ (Mentioned only)\n-   _The Return of the King_\n\nIn the films\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring (film)_ (Mentioned only in the Extended\n    Edition)\n-   _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_\n-   _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_\n-   _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\n\n\nLee Pace portrays Thranduil as a blonde elf with a crown of leaves and\ntwigs in Peter Jackson's adaption of _The Hobbit,_ and is a major\ncharacter in _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_. The films\nincorporated several changes to Thranduil's character and actions. While\nthe Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain are fleeing their home after Smaug's\nattack, Thranduil, riding an Elven elk, arrives with an army. Thorin\nsees them and asks for help, but Thranduil, realizing that he would just\nbe leading his soldiers to their deaths, refuses, not wanting to risk\nthe lives of his kin, causing Thorin to develop a strong dislike of the\nElves. In the extended edition of _An Unexpected Journey_, it was\nrevealed that King Thrór withheld gems from Thranduil, causing goodwill\nbetween Dwarves and elves to run thin.\n\nIn _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_, Thranduil appears on his\nthrone after the capture of Thorin and Company. Thranduil offers to\nrelease the Dwarves from captivity and help them in their quest to\nreclaim the Lonely Mountain if Thorin will give Thranduil a share of the\ntreasure. Thorin refuses, recounting the time when Thranduil refused to\nhelp his people during the siege of Smaug in the Lonely Mountain. As\nThorin continues his narrative, Thranduil looks horrified and angry. He\ndemands that Thorin should not talk to him about the dragon fire for he\nhas suffered from it himself, having “faced the great serpents of the\nNorth.” At this point—by temporarily either creating or removing an\nillusion—he briefly shows himself with severe burns on the left side of\nhis face, including a missing cheek and an apparently blind left eye,\nand asserts that it was Thrór's greed that incurred the dragon's wrath.\nHe then orders his guards to take Thorin away. Additionally, Thranduil\nis more antagonistic toward the Dwarves in the films, locking them into\ndungeon cells as soon as they arrive, whereas in the book _The Hobbit_\nhe was more generous, giving the Dwarves (aside from Thorin, whom he had\npreviously captured and imprisoned) free run of his stronghold until\nthey proved insulting and disagreeable toward him.\n\n\n\nLater, Thranduil confronts Tauriel, telling her that as a captain of the\nguard she must drive the Giant Spiders out of Mirkwood. She explains\nthat new spiders would enter the kingdom after the previous ones were\nwiped out, and suggests sorties to destroy the spider's source outside\nthe kingdom's boundaries near Dol Guldur, but Thranduil quickly\ndismissed this idea due to his isolationist doctrine. When she brings up\nthat other lands would also be susceptible to spiders, Thranduil says\nthat he doesn't care about other lands. He mentions then that Legolas,\nhis son, has grown fond of her but that she should not give him hope,\nbecause she is a common Silvan elf and Legolas is the son of a king.\nThranduil is once again seen when Legolas and Tauriel return with an Orc\nhostage, Narzug. He is interrogated but refuses to answer, mocking\nTauriel about the impending death of a dwarf. Thranduil dismisses\nTauriel after she threatens to kill the Orc, commenting that he doesn't\ncare about the death of one dwarf. However, when Narzug begins to mock\nThranduil about a coming great war, saying his master serves _The One,_\nthe Elf-king swiftly decapitates the captive with a stroke of his sword,\nclearly fearful of what the Orc had revealed. When Legolas asks why he\ndid that when the Orc could have told them more, Thranduil replies,\n“There was no more he could tell _me._” Reminded of his promise to free\nthe Orc, Thranduil replies, “I did free him. I freed his wretched head\nfrom his miserable shoulders.” He then orders that all the gates to the\nkingdom to be closed, now knowing that the dangers of war were upon\nthem, stating that,“No one enters this kingdom, and no one leaves it.”\n\n\n\nIn _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_, an armoured Thranduil\narrived in Dale upon a magnificent large elk, and gave supplies to the\ntownsfolk who had lost everything to the dragon's fire. Despite Bard's\nthanks, he told him that his true purpose for coming was to reclaim a\njewel necklace in Thorin's possession - the White Gems of Lasgalen,\nwhich was revealed much later to be a remembrance of his late wife, who\nhad died in the hands of the Witch-king. Bard was aghast at the prospect\nof fighting for jewels, but Thranduil doubted that a Dwarf could be\nreasoned with. Nevertheless, he agreed to give Bard a chance to convince\nThorin to give in. Bard failed, and Thranduil ordered his army to march.\n\nElsewhere, Legolas revealed to Tauriel that his mother (Thranduil's\nwife) had been taken prisoner to Gundabad, where she died, and Thranduil\nnever spoke of her, as if she had never existed to begin with. When\nGandalf arrived, he urged Thranduil and Bard to call off the attack on\nthe Lonely Mountain, and informed him about Sauron's elaborate plans of\ntaking the Mountain, which would enable him to eventually destroy all of\nMiddle-earth. However, Thranduil refused to believe him, and accused him\nof reigniting the enmity between Elves and Dwarves by urging Thorin and\nhis Company to embark upon their quest. Even after Bilbo gave them the\nArkenstone in an attempt to stop the fighting from materializing, a war\nnearly broke out, but Azog's arrival and Dain's departure to deal with\nthe army of Orcs called it off. Initially, Thranduil was intensely\nreluctant to participate in the fight, but after Gandalf forced him to\nrealize that it was madness to not fight the Orcs, he relented - sending\nhis swordsmen into the fray, instructing his archers to rain down death,\nand he himself wielded his broadsword skillfully against the forces of\nevil.\n\nHowever, Azog realised that the armies could not fight on two fronts,\nand sent the rest of his army to Dale to cut them off. This forced\nThranduil to retreat to the city with Bard, Gandalf, Bilbo, and a large\nportion of his army, leaving the Dwarves to fend for themselves. Upon\nhis entry into the city, he was dismounted and surrounded, but easily\nkilled his assailants and continually participated in the battle, but\nended up being aghast at how much Elven blood was spilled in defense of\na Dwarven land, and rather than warning Thorin or helping Dain, he\nattempted to take advantage of the respite to pull out. It was then that\nhe encountered Tauriel, who declared that he would not depart, for the\nDwarves would die if he left, but his response was that it did not\nmatter as the Dwarves were mortal. At this, Tauriel drew her bow and\naccused him of being a loveless person who viewed his life as more\nimportant than those of others. Thranduil retaliated by slicing her bow,\ntelling her that what she felt for Kili was not real, and asked if she\nwas ready to die for love.\n\nThis reduces Tauriel to tears, but before Thranduil had time to strike\nat her, Legolas intervened by striking down Thranduil's sword, and told\nhim flatly that he would have to kill his son if he wished to slay her.\nLegolas and Tauriel then departed for Ravenhill, leaving Thranduil in\nshock. In a deleted scene, it was at this moment that Gandalf reminded\nhim that his wife not only left him with gems, but also a\nflesh-and-blood son (Legolas), and asked him which did he think she\nwould prefer him to value more, causing Thranduil to turn to Gandalf in\na state of greater shock and grief.\n\nIt was unknown if Thranduil had a change of heart, and stayed to aid the\nDwarves. However, after the battle ended, he went to Ravenhill alone to\nfind Legolas and Tauriel. He ran into Legolas, who confessed that he\ncould not go back with him. Thranduil advised him to find the Dunedain,\nfor there was a young ranger there whom he should meet - his father,\nArathorn, was a good man, and he might become a great man himself. He\nwent on to explain to Legolas that the ranger's name in the wild was\n_“Strider”_, but his true name (Aragorn) was something he had to learn\nfor himself, and he also confided in Legolas that his mother loved him\nmore than anything else in this world. At this, father and son exchanged\na mutual gesture of farewell and affection, and Thranduil accepted\nLegolas' decision to be on his own.\n\nAs Legolas left to go to the North, Thranduil found Tauriel weeping over\nKili's corpse, and upon seeing him, she asked him why love could hurt so\nmuch. Touched by the sight, along with the memory of his wife's death at\nAngmar's hands, he replies _“Because it was real”_, and agreed with her\nplan to bury Kili. Though he was not seen afterwards, it was safe to\nassume that after the funerals and burials, he departed for Mirkwood.\n\nRankin/Bass's The Hobbit\n\n\n\nIn the Rankin/Bass 1977 animated version of _The Hobbit_, Thranduil was\nvoiced by Otto Preminger. In this version he is a golden-haired,\nbalding, green-skinned being whose people bare little resemblance to the\nmore human-looking Elves led by Elrond. He captures Thorin's company\nafter mistaking their approach for an attack, and despite their attempts\nto convince him otherwise he has them imprisoned. He and Bard later join\nforces to take the Lonely Mountain, only to quickly join forces with\nThorin's army of Dwarves upon seeing the approach of the Goblin Army."

    "text": "THRÁIN II was the father of Thorin II Oakenshield, and the son of\nKing Thrór. He became heir of the lost King under the Mountain and King\nof Durin's Folk as THRÁIN II when his father Thrór was murdered in\nMoria, and he was a direct descendant of Durin the Deathless.\n\n\nBiography\n\nThráin was born in TA 2644 to Thrór, who at that time was King Under the\nMountain. He accompanied his father in all political, financial and\nmilitary matters and was his only son and heir. In the movies, at some\npoint of his lifetime (before TA 2770), he lost his left eye.\n\nHe married sometime before TA 2746 and had three children: Thorin,\nFrerin and Dis.\n\nThráin fled with his father, his three children, and the surviving\nDwarves of Erebor when the Dragon Smaug descended on the Lonely Mountain\nin TA 2770, destroyed the kingdom and claimed it as his own, along with\nall the treasures and gold within. Together with the other survivors,\namong them his father and his children, Thráin began a long homeless\nexile. They wandered farther south and they eventually settled in the\nhills of Dunland. There, they remained for twenty more years where they\nwere forced to make a mangy living.\n\nYears after the destruction of the kingdom of Lonely Mountain, a life of\npoverty took a toll on the mind of King Thrór and he became restless and\ndesperate. He sought to journey away in search of a scrap of wealth but\nhe did not specify Moria. At their parting, he gave to his son Thráin\nhis Ring of Power as well as the map of Lonely Mountain. He departed\nfrom his people with a single companion, his only and old friend named\nNár.\n\nNár would return to their dwelling in Dunland many weeks later, but he\nwould mysteriously return alone. He told the tale to Thráin of what had\nbecome of his father Thrór, who had brashly ventured into Moria, despite\nthe pleas of Nár to not go forth, but he did not return. Days later, it\nwas revealed that the king had been branded and murdered by Azog the Orc\nwho claimed to now rule the ancient mansions of Durin's Folk.\n\nWhen Thráin heard Nár's recounting of what had become of his father, and\nthat an Orc was ruling their ancestral home, he wept and tore his beard,\nand then fell silent. For seven days he sat and said no word. However,\non the seventh day he stood up and declared “This cannot be borne!”\nThese words were the beginning of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs.\n\nThráin sent messengers to deliver the tale to all the corners of the\nworld. Word was sent to all the Houses of the other Dwarven Fathers. The\nkings of the other Houses answered to Thráin's call to vengeance, as\nthey all saw this heinous deed committed by Azog to be a profound\ndishonor to the heir of the eldest of their race, and it raised their\nfury. While most of the war was fought in the mines and tunnels beneath\nthe Misty Mountains, the bloody climatic battle took place beneath the\nEast-Gate of Moria in the valley of Azanulbizar. Heavy losses were\ninflicted on both sides. Frerin, the younger brother of Thorin\nOakenshield was among those that fell. Thráin himself had been wounded\nin the battle and suffered a grievous eye-wound. The tide of battle at\nlast turned when fresh reinforcements from the Iron Hills arrived late.\nRealizing that his hordes were being annihilated and routed by the\nDwarves, Azog turned and attempted to flee back to the gate but was\nslain by Dain Ironfoot, bringing about an end to the war.\n\nAfterward, Thráin led the remainder of his people, among them his eldest\nson Thorin Oakenshield, back to Dunland where they dwelt for a while.\nEventually they relocated to the northern Blue Mountains where they made\ntheir dwelling among the ruins of Belegost. Thráin had also taken with\nhim a map which showed a secret entrance into the Lonely Mountain. After\nsome time, they showed signs of prosperity and their numbers slowly\nbegan to increase.\n\nMany years later, Thráin grew older and he became restless. His desire\nto reclaim his kingdom of the Lonely Mountain grew. In TA 2841, he and a\ngroup of followers including Balin and Dwalin left their dwelling in the\nBlue Mountains and journeyed into Wilderland. They were pursued by the\nservants of Sauron and one morning, in the eaves of Mirkwood, his\ncompanions awoke to find that Thráin was missing. They searched in vain\nfor him for days but he could not be found at all. It was later learned\nthat he had been captured and imprisoned in the pits of Sauron's\nstronghold of Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood. There he was tortured,\nand Sauron took from him the last of the Dwarven Rings of Power, and\nleft him there to die.\n\n\n\nBut before his death, while on a mission to Dol Guldur, Gandalf the Grey\ncame upon Thráin, and was given the old map. Thráin appeared so\ndiminished that he had forgotten almost everything as well as his own\nname. Gandalf promised to deliver it to Thráin's son, but could not\nconfirm that this dwarf was in fact Thráin due to Thráin's loss of\nmemory. There he died.\n\nYears later Gandalf met with Thorin near Bree, and realized who the\nDwarf he had met in Dol Guldur had been. He promised to help Thorin in\nhis quest to the Lonely Mountain in many ways, the most notable of which\nwas by inviting a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins along to fulfill the role\nof burglar.\n\nSeveral decades later, during the Council of Elrond, Glóin admitted that\npart of Balin's reasons for attempting to re-enter Moria was to find the\nlast dwarven Ring of Power, since it had last been seen in Thrór's\npossession when he died there. Gandalf regretfully said that Thrór had\npassed the ring to Thráin, and it had been taken from him in Dol Goldur.\nGlóin lamented this loss, wondering aloud when, if ever, the dwarves\nwould have their revenge against Sauron.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\n\n\n_The Hobbit_ film trilogy\n\nYoung Thráin II is played by Michael Mizrahi and Thomas Robins in _The\nHobbit: An Unexpected Journey_. For the extended edition scenes in the\nBattle of Azanulbizar and Dol Guldur in _The Hobbit: The Desolation of\nSmaug_'', ''Thráin is portrayed by British actor Sir Antony Sher.\n\nHe became heir of the lost King under the Mountain and King of Durin's\nFolk. When his father was killed by Azog in the Battle of Azanulbizar in\nTA 2799, Thráin tried to restrain his son Thorin from charging towards\nthe Pale Orc and explained that Azog was tasked to wipe out the line of\nDurin. After ordering his son to stay away from the deadly Orc, Thráin\nled a charge towards the Dimrill Gate, but was overpowered by Azog and\nlost Thrór's Ring of Power to the Pale Orc. Many Dwarves believed that\nThráin was driven mad by grief and had been among the fallen, but his\nson Thorin had searched among the dead bodies of Moria and knew that\nThráin had survived the battle. However, in truth, it was revealed that\nhe was captured by the Necromancer and became a prisoner in Dol Guldur.\nDuring his lifetime in the old fortress, Thráin had been tortured for\ninformation about the map and key to the Lonely Mountain, but Thráin\nrefused to answer and would not tell him that he gave the items to\nGandalf for safekeeping.\n\nAfter sending Radagast the Brown to Galadriel to tell her of Sauron's\nreturn, Gandalf enters Dol Guldur's interior and begins searching for\nany sign of evil. Deep in the abandoned fortress, a diminished Thráin\nwatches Gandalf, before jumping down onto the wizard. The two engage in\nbattle, until Gandalf manages to restrain Thráin, and bring him to his\nsenses. Gandalf recognizes his old friend, and Thráin tells him he has\nbeen in Dol Guldur for a lifetime. Thráin recounts the Battle of\nAzanulbizar, and how Azog the Defiler severed his finger that bore his\nDwarven Ring of Power by a dagger. Gandalf tells Thráin they must leave,\nbut Thráin says there is no way out. Gandalf informs Thráin that his son\nhas embarked on the Quest of Erebor, to which Thráin says that Thorin,\nor anyone, must not enter the mountain.\n\nWhile making their escape, Thráin continued to explain to Gandalf that\nSmaug and Sauron, whom he calls The One, are in league with each other\nuntil Azog himself launches a surprise attack, knocking Gandalf to the\nfloor. Thráin was terrified when he witnessed the whole army of Guldur\nOrcs that were getting ready to leave the fortress and travel to the\nLonely Mountain. Before Azog was about to deliver the killing blow,\nThráin and Gandalf managed to flee. As they reached the exit of the\nfortress, Sauron confronts them, preventing them from leaving. Since\nthere was nowhere to run or escape, Thráin tells Gandalf to tell his\nson, Thorin, that he loves him, to which Gandalf replies he can tell\nThorin himself once they get out of here. Despite Gandalf's attempts to\nprotect him, Thráin told him that it was too late, and was grabbed by\nthe The Necromancer's form and killed."

    "text": "THRÓR was a King of Durin's Folk, the son of Dáin I, the grandson of\nNáin II, the father of Thráin II, the brother of Frór, and Grór, the\ngrandfather of Thorin II Oakenshield, Frerin, and Dís, and the\ngreat-grandfather of Fíli and Kíli.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nIn his early life, Thrór and his family lived in the dragon-plagued Grey\nMountains. In TA 2589, when their halls came under attack by\nCold-drakes, his father Dáin I and younger brother Frór were both slain\nat their gates by a great Cold-Drake, and Thrór inherited the kingship.\nHe and his youngest brother Grór resolved to divide their folk: Thrór\nled a small portion of the House of Durin to recolonize Erebor where\nthey rediscovered the Arkenstone. Grór led a greater portion of Durin's\nFolk further east to the Iron Hills where he founded his Dwarven realm.\nUnder Thrór's leadership, Erebor prospered for over a century.\nEventually the wealth of the kingdom attracted the attention of the\ndragon known as Smaug, who flew south and destroyed the kingdom, killing\nhundreds of Dwarves and driving away Thrór and his family, as well as\nthousands of other surviving dwarves. The majority of the survivors\nmigrated to the Iron Hills, but some followed King Thrór, his son Thráin\nII, and grandson Thorin Oakenshield west into a long and homeless\nwandering. They eventually settled in the hills of Dunland where they\nmade a living as best they could.\n\nTwenty years later in TA 2790, Thrór now old, poor, and desperate, gave\nto his son Thráin II the last of the Seven Rings and a map of the Lonely\nMountain. He then left his people and journeyed away north with a single\ncompanion called Nár. They crossed over the Misty Mountains through the\nRedhorn Pass and then came south again, crossing the Silverlode into the\nvalley of Azanulbizar beneath the East Gate of Moria. When they arrived,\nthe gate was open. Nár begged Thrór to beware but Thrór disregarded his\npleas and proudly entered Moria as its returning heir, but he did not\ncome back.\n\nNár waited and hid nearby for many days. One day he heard a great shout,\nfollowed by the blast of a horn, and a body was flung out onto the\nsteps. It was indeed the body of Thrór, as Nár had feared. Then a voice\ncalled out to him from just inside the gate. Rather than being killed as\nwell, Nár was instead made use of as a messenger. He was told to deliver\na warning that 'beggars' who would not wait at the doors but instead\nentered to attempt thieving, would meet a similar fate. Nár was told to\nbring this message back to his people. But that was not all: the voice\nproclaimed that he now ruled Moria, and if any wanted to know who was\nking, he had written his name on the beggar's face. Thrór's head lay\nsevered next to his body. Nár turned it over and found branded across\nthe forehead, written in Dwarven runes, a name that would be branded in\nthe hearts of all Dwarves: Azog. He was barred from retrieving the head\nof Thrór and was struck with a pouch containing a few coins of little\nworth, which Azog referred to as a 'fee', but it was meant as a final\ninsulting gesture. Nár took the pouch and fled down the Silverlode. When\nhe looked back, Orcs had emerged from the gate and were hacking apart\nThrór's body and flinging the pieces to the black crows.\n\nThis was the tale that Nár brought back to Thráin II when he returned to\nDunland weeks later. After seven days of sitting in silent grief, Thráin\nat last stood up and declared that this atrocity would be answered. This\nwas the beginning of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, although it took\nup three years for the Dwarves to gather their full forces. Several\nyears later, Dain Ironfoot, son of Náin, beheaded Azog and mounted the\nOrc's head on a stick. The pouch of coins was stuffed into Azog's mouth.\nThorin, Thrór's grandson, hated Azog ever since.\n\n\nAppearances in the Books and films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Hobbit_ (first mentioned)\n\nIn the films\n\n-   _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_ (first appearance)\n-   _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_ (mentioned only)\n-   ''The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies ''(mentioned only)\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\n In the 2012 live-action film _The Hobbit: An\nUnexpected Journey_, Thrór is portrayed by Welsh actor Jeffrey Thomas.\n\nIn that film's story line (a significant departure from Tolkien's\nversion), as recounted by Balin, Thrór leads the Dwarves forces at the\nBattle of Azanulbizar, where the displaced Dwarves of Lonely Mountain\nattempt to reclaim Moria and meet an army of Orcs led by Azog. However,\nThrór is killed and beheaded in hand-to-hand combat with Azog, resulting\nin his son, Thráin II, going mad with grief and disappearing, while\nThorin II Oakenshield is enraged enough to challenge the Defiler. With\nnothing but a sword and a small oak branch as a shield, he succeeds in\npartially avenging his grandfather's death by cutting off Azog's hand\nand turning the tide of the battle.\n\nIn all three films, Thrór is partially blamed for the coming of Smaug,\nhaving become so greedy and overtaken with lust for gold that his\nmassive hoard eventually draws the dragon to the Lonely Mountain. In\ndeleted scenes from the first film, Elrond describes the gold-lust as a\nhereditary disease of Durin's line, and Thorin is shown worrying about\nwhether he has inherited his grandfather's “sickness.” In the second\nfilm, Thranduil claims to have warned Thrór about the dangers of\namassing so much gold, but the dwarf refused to listen; likewise, Balin\nwarns Thorin that a “sickness” lies upon Thrór's hoard, and Balin fears\nit will drive Thorin mad as it did Thrór. These words come back to haunt\nThorin in the third film, when Thorin finally sees that he has succumbed\nto his grandfather's sickness, before casting off his crown and rallying\nthe Company to join the other factions in fighting against Azog's army.\n\nPersonality\n\nThrór was truly a son of Durin: powerful, honorable, and proud in his\nown right. However, in time his love of gold had grown far too fierce\nand he began spending endless hours fawning over his rivers of treasure.\nIt was this obsession and vast treasure that attracted the unwanted\nattention of Smaug, the greatest fire-drake of the Third Age. Like many\nDwarf lords it can be presumed that he was stout in body as he was in\nspirit, albeit quite greedy. This greed can be attributed, no doubt, to\nthe effects of his ring of power which brooded a great lust for gold\nwithin their Dwarven bearers. This greed even lead to the spurning of\nKing Thranduil, and the eventual souring of their relationship.\n\n\nGallery"

    "text": "THÉODEN was the seventeenth King of Rohan, and last of the Second Line\nof the royal house of House of Eorl.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarlier Years\n\nThéoden was the only son of Thengel, and became king after the death of\nhis father in TA 2980. Théoden spoke Sindarin and Westron more often\nthan Rohirric, due to the influence of his father, and spent a part of\nhis youth growing up in the mountain vales of Gondor, his mother's\nhomeland.\n\nHis sister Théodwyn lived with him in Edoras, and after she and her\nhusband both died he adopted her children Éomer and Éowyn as his own. He\nhad a son Théodred, whose mother Elfhild died in childbirth.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nBy the time of the War of the Ring, Théoden had been king for nearly 40\nyears, and was becoming old and tired. He was increasingly misled by his\nchief adviser Gríma (or _Wormtongue_ as most others in the Mark called\nhim), who was secretly in the employ of Saruman the White. Gríma may\neven have been poisoning Théoden. In the last years before the War of\nthe Ring, Théoden let his rule slip out of his hands, and Gríma gained\nan increasingly large hold over him. Rohan was troubled again by Orcs\nand Dunlendings as well as the new fighting Uruk-hai, who operated under\nthe will of Saruman, ruling from Isengard.\n\nWhen Théoden's son Théodred was mortally wounded at a battle at the\nFords of Isen in skirmish with the Orcs of Saruman, his nephew Éomer\nbecame his heir. Éomer fell out of favor with Wormtongue and was\neventually banished from Rohan.\n\nWhen Gandalf the White, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli appeared before him,\nThéoden initially rebuked Gandalf's advice to resist Saruman, but after\nbeing released from the effects of Gríma, he commanded Hama to release\nhis nephew and bring him his sword, and led the Riders of Rohan into\nbattle against Saruman but having found that Saruman's forces had broken\nthrough Rohan's outer defenses. Théoden, under advice from Gandalf,\nretreated and fought against Saruman's hordes at the Battle of Helm's\nDeep. After this, he became known as THÉODEN EDNEW, the Renewed, because\nhe had thrown off the yoke of Saruman.\n\nBefore the battle, Théoden had made a favorite of Merry, and expressed\ngreat interest in hearing more about The Shire, especially Hobbits' lore\nsurrounding pipe-weed. He led the Rohirrim to the aid of Gondor at the\nBattle of the Pelennor Fields bravely charging the legions of Sauron,\nwhere he won great glory by defeating “The Black Serpent,” a chieftain\nof the Southrons, in single combat.\n\n\n\nHe challenged the Witch-king of the Nine Ringwraiths, and was\nunconscious when his horse Snowmane fell upon him after being spooked by\nthe Ringwraith's fell beast. He was quickly protected by his niece Éowyn\nand the Hobbit Meriadoc Brandybuck both of whom had ridden to war in\nsecret.\n\nTheoden's wounds were mortal and he perished on the plains of Pelennor.\nHis body was preserved in the Hallows of Minas Tirith until Eomer\nreturned to Rohan, and Theoden was buried in Edoras.\n\nAfter his death, a Rohirrim minstrel Gléowine composed a song for him\nand the other Kings of Rohan.\n\n Out of doubt, out of dark, to the day's rising he rode singing in the\nsun, sword unsheathing. Hope he rekindled, and in hope he ended; over\ndeath, over dread, over doom lifted out of loss, out of life, unto long\nglory.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _THÉODEN_ is taken from the Anglo-Saxon word _þeoden_, meaning\n“lord”. It is related to the Old Norse word _þjóðann_, meaning “leader\nof the people” (i.e. “King”).\n\nIt might have been translated from the original Rohirric TÛRAC, an old\nword for “king”.\n\n\nEarlier versions in the legendarium\n\nIn one of Tolkien's early drafts of his _The Lord of the Rings_ story,\nThéoden also had a daughter by the name of Idis. She often appeared\nalongside her cousin Éowyn, but never spoke, and was always overshadowed\nby her.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nRadio versions (1956)\n\nIn the _The Lord of the Rings (1956 radio series)_, he was voiced by\nValentine Dyall, and in The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series) he was\nvoiced by Erik Bauersfeld, and in 1981 BBC Radio 4 version of _The Lord\nof the Rings_, Théoden's healing is described in song rather than\ndramatised conventionally, which tends to lessen its impact. In this\nadaptation he was voiced by Jack May of the Archers frame.\n\nRalph Bakshi (1978)\n\nIn the _The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)_, Théoden was voiced by Philip\nStone.\n\nRankin-Bass (1980)\n\nIn the _The Return of the King (1980 film)_, Théoden was voiced by Don\nMessick.\n\n_The Lord of the Rings_ film trilogy\n\n\n\nThéoden, portrayed by Bernard Hill, is a major character and secondary\nprotagonist in Peter Jackson's film trilogy. He appears in _The Two\nTowers_ and _The Return of the King_. Théoden is depicted as a\nconsiderate leader and mighty warrior who does not believe that Sauron\ncan be defeated; however, he wishes to die with honor and make him and\nhis people “worthy of remembrance.”\n\nIn _The Two Towers_, Théoden is initially outright possessed by Saruman,\nin a deviation from the books. While under Saruman's spell, Théoden\nappears extremely aged, with grey hair and glassy eyes, and is unwilling\nto defend Rohan from the Dunlendings and Uruk-hai pillaging the\nWestfold. After Théoden's son Théodred is killed by orcs, the new heir\nÉomer is banished by Wormtongue (on “orders” of the king) from Edoras;\nhe takes with him some 2,000 Rohirrim riders.\n\nGandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas arrive in Edoras and Gandalf frees\nThéoden from Saruman's spell. The king recovers his sanity and a healthy\nappearance, and banishes Gríma (though originally desiring to execute\nthe spy). Théoden mourns his son and decides that the best way to defend\nhis people is to evacuate Edoras to Helm's Deep, a decision Gandalf\ncriticizes.\n\nIn _The Two Towers_, Théoden seems unsure as to whether his countrymen\ncan fend off Saruman's hordes. Before the Battle of the Hornburg, he\npoetically expresses his belief that the world of men is soon to be\ndestroyed. As the Uruk-hai overwhelm the fortress, he seems resigned to\nhis fate; when he “rides out” with Aragorn on a final suicide charge, it\nis more so in order to die with honor than to actually defeat the\nUruk-hai. However, Gandalf arrives during their charge and liberates\nHelm's Deep.\n\nBy _The Return of the King_, Théoden has become more confident in\nhimself and his people. He boldly declares that Rohan will answer\nGondor's call for aid once the Beacons of Minas Tirith are lit, and he\nassembles an army of 6,000 riders to liberate Gondor from Mordor's\narmies. Though he does not believe that his men can actually defeat\nSauron, he inspires the Rohirrim to ride to Gondor's aid for the sake of\nhonor.\n\nAt the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Théoden leads the Rohirrim in\ntheir charge against the orcish armies. The Rohirrim largely defeat the\norcs only to face a greater challenge in Harad's Mumakil cavalry.\nThéoden's riders appear well on the way to victory when the Witch-king\nof Angmar arrives and throws Théoden from his steed. The king is crushed\nbeneath his horse, and is about to be eaten by the Witch-King's\nFellbeast when Éowyn intervenes. Théoden lives long enough to witness\nhis niece kill the Witch-King before succumbing to his injuries.\n\nIn the epilogue, it is suggested that Éomer ascends to the throne of\nRohan, although at one point in the film Théoden suggests that Éowyn\nshould rule if anything were to happen to him. (Likely under the\nassumption that if he dies in Gondor, Éomer will be dead with him.)"

During the War of\nthe Ring, Prince Théodred was the Second Marshal of Rohan and commanded\nwestern Rohan. He set Grimbold in command with fifty dismounted Riders,\nwhile Théodred himself manned the eyot, to cover Grimbold if he was\ndriven back. Amidst the battle, Elfhelm found Grimbold fighting two\naxemen for Théodred's body. Théodred was slain by an Orc-man in the\nFirst Battle of the Fords of Isen, and his body was defended by the\nmarshal Grimbold. The death of Théodred made his cousin Éomer the\nheir to the throne of Rohan. Little else is known about him, except that\nhe loved Éomer like a brother, and loved no one more except for Théoden.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis name is taken from the Anglo-Saxon words _þeod_ (“folk,” “people,”\n“nation”) and _ræd_ (“counsel”).\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn earlier works, Théodred was not the son of Théoden, but of Théoden's\nbrother instead.\n\nIn the first version, Théodred's death had been January 25, a day before\nBoromir's death and the Breaking of the Fellowship.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Lord of Rings trilogy\n\n\n\nIn Peter Jackson's _The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers_, the death of\nThéodred, who is played by Paris Howe Strewe, is a major event early in\nthe movie, whereas in the book, it has all happened by the time the\nsetting takes place in Rohan. Also, Théodred was supposed to be a man of\nforty-one years when he died, but in the movie, he is portrayed as a\nmuch younger man, between the ages of 18 and 25. He dies in Meduseld and\nis buried in a barrow outside the gates. At his funerary procession, a\nlament, original to the films only, is sung for him in Rohirric by\nÉowyn.\n\nVideo Games\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings Online_, Théodred's age appears more accurate\nto the book. While his riders defend the Fords of Isen against the\nDunlendings, he leads a small party into nearby Dunland to scout for\npotential threats, where they encounter the Grey Company led by\nHalbarad. He later returns to the Gap of Rohan where he sets up a daring\nplan to attack Isengard, in an attempt to unsettle Saruman and force the\nWizard's forces back into the walls. This was to try to keep the White\nHand at bay a bit longer so that defenses could be mounted on Rohan's\nborder. This plan goes awry when they were overrun by armies of Uruks\nout of Isengard, and forced to retreat to the Gap. Grimbold and half of\nThéodred's Rohirrim attempted to slow the White Hand forces to give\nThéodred time to escape.\n\n\n\nOn the way back to the Ford, Théodred was ambushed by a contingent of\nUruks who had flanked the Rohirrim and is surrounded on the island in\nthe Ford. He is stabbed by one of Uruk commander's half-orcs, and falls\nto the ground, while another courageous Man of Rohan jumps in to defend\nhim who bravely dies, giving just enough time for Grimbold and the rest\nof the men retreating from Isengard to mount a rescue. As well as a\nforce from Helm's Deep led by Elfhelm to mount a charge at the remaining\nUruks force. Unfortunately, Théodred had been fatally wounded. After the\nbattle, Grimbold gave him a cushion to make his final minutes as restful\nas possible. In his last few moments, he asked to be buried on the\nisland in the Ford, along with his men, where they had made their final\nstand as a warning to the forces of Saruman of Rohan's resolve."

He was a\nmember of the Fellowship of the Ring.\n\n\nBiography\n\nPippin was born to Paladin Took II and Eglantine Banks on the spring of\nTA 2990 (SR 1390). He was the youngest of four children and had three\nolder sisters, Pearl, Pimpernel, and Pervinca. His father's sister,\nEsmeralda Took, was the mother of Meriadoc Brandybuck, thus making\nPippin and Merry first cousins.\n\nThrough his father, Pippin was the second-cousin once-removed of Frodo,\nand the first-cousin twice-removed of Bilbo Baggins.\n\nFellowship of the Ring\n\nWhile on their way to Buckland, Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, and\nPeregrin Took encountered a Black Rider, who was warded off by the\npresence of the company of Elves, led by Gildor Inglorion. Meriadoc\nBrandybuck later joined them once they reached Buckland. They were\nwaylaid by Old Man Willow in the Old Forest, and Tom Bombadil rescued\nthem and took them into his house. On the way to Bree, Pippin was\ncaught up with the Barrow-wights on the Barrow-downs. After the\nencounter, Pippin acquired a Dagger of Westernesse.\n\nIn The Prancing Pony, Frodo accidentally slipped the One Ring upon his\nfinger, drawing the attention of the Black Riders. Their group met a\nRanger of the North, Strider. The inn was attacked by the Nazgûl at\nnight, and the four hobbits were successfully led away by Strider, whose\nreal name was Aragorn.\n\nAragorn led them to Weathertop, where the group was once again attacked\nby the Black Riders. In haste to get an injured Frodo to Rivendell,\nthe Elf-lord Glorfindel arrived and guided them.\n\nAfter the Council of Elrond, Pippin and Merry were allowed by Gandalf to\njoin the Fellowship of the Ring. In Moria, Pippin's curiosity\ndropped a stone down the well, which lead to the beating drums from\nbeneath the ground. It incurred Gandalf's wrath, and he called Pippin a\n“Fool of a Took”.\n\nBreaking of the Fellowship\n\nDuring the Skirmish at Amon Hen, Pippin and Merry were protected by\nBoromir, who was killed in the process. The two hobbits were taken away\nby the Uruk-hai, mistaking them to be the Ring-bearer. On their way\nto Isengard, Pippin dropped the elven-brooch he received from\nLothlórien, as a sign for Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, who were in\npursuit.\n\nWhen a company of the Rohirrim ambushed the Uruk-hai, Pippin and\nMerry were able to escape into Fangorn Forest, where they meet the Ent\nTreebeard. They drank Ent-draughts, which gave them incredible\nheights. Pippin and Merry befriended Treebeard and told him what\nhappened to them. After the Entmoot, the Ents decided to march against\nIsengard.\n\nAfter the battle, Pippin and Merry were sitting on their “field of\nvictory”. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli were reunited with them.\n\nGuard of the Citadel\n\nIn Orthanc, Pippin picked up the _palantír_, which Gríma Wormtongue\nthrew. As he looked into the stone, Pippin had a first-hand encounter\nwith Sauron himself, leading the Dark Lord to assume Pippin was the\nRing-bearer. Gandalf and Pippin then rode on Shadowfax and went to\nGondor, for the latter's protection from Sauron's forces. Pippin met\nDenethor II, the Ruling Steward of Gondor and Boromir's father. In\nreturn for Boromir's death, Pippin pledged his allegiance to Denethor\nand became the Guard of the Citadel.  While in Minas Tirith, Pippin befriended Beregond, a\nfellow Guard of the Citadel, and Faramir, Boromir's younger brother.\nDuring the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Pippin witnessed Denethor\npreparing a pyre for him and an unconscious Faramir. He quickly went out\nin search for Gandalf and saved Faramir from being burned to death.\nDenethor, however, was not rescued and threw himself off of Minas\nTirith.\n\nPippin was among the Army of the West, which was led by Aragorn. They\nassaulted the Black Gate to divert the attention of the Eye of Sauron\nand give Frodo enough time to destroy the Ring. In the battle, Pippin\nmanaged to kill one of the Olog-hai, a troll-race bred by Sauron, the\nfirst hobbit ever to do so. He was knocked unconscious when the troll\nfell on him. Gimli later recognized the Hobbit feet under the Troll and\ndragged him out of the battle, saving his life. After the\nrestoration of the monarchy, King Elessar knighted him and granted him\nand his fellow hobbits leave to return home, as well as leave to return\nto Gondor whenever they liked. Later, he, Merry, Frodo, and Sam were\ninstrumental in overthrowing the small remainder of Saruman's forces\nduring the Scouring of the Shire.\n\nAfter the War\n\nIn the year FO 6 of the Fourth Age Pippin married Diamond of Long\nCleeve, when she was 32 and he himself was 37. They had one son, Faramir\nTook I, who later married Samwise Gamgee's daughter Goldilocks\nGardner.\n\nIn the year FO 13, Pippin became the 32nd Thain of the Shire, a position\nhe held for 50 years before retiring in FO 63, when he revisited Rohan\nand Gondor with Merry. He remained in Gondor for the rest of his\nlife.\n\nPippin probably died sometime after the year FO 64 and was laid to rest\nwith Merry in Gondor. After the great King Elessar (Aragorn) died in FO\n120, Merry and Pippin were entombed next to the great king.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _PEREGRIN_ was derived from the Latin word _peregrinus_\n(“pilgrim”).\n\nRAZANUR TÛK was the Westron of Pippin, which comes from _raza_\n(“stranger”) and _razan_ (“foreign”). It was a name of a legendary\ntraveller. \n\nTitles\n\n-   THAIN PEREGRIN I - Pippin's title when he became a Thain of the\n    Shire.\n-   _ERNIL I PHERIANNATH_ - It is the Sindarin for “Prince of the\n    Halflings”; given to Pippin by the people of Minas Tirith.\n-   GUARD OF THE CITADEL - Given to him by Denethor II, Ruling Steward\n    of Gondor\n-   KNIGHT OF GONDOR - Given by King Aragorn II Elessar\n-   COUNSELLOR OF THE NORTH-KINGDOM - Granted to him when he became\n    Thain of the Shire.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nThe hair on his head and his feet (which are exceptionally hairy, even\nfor a Hobbit) was almost golden and curly. At the beginning of Quest of\nthe Ring, he was smaller than the rest of the Hobbits because he was the\nyoungest. But after he and Merry drank the draft from Treebeard, they\nbecame some of the tallest hobbits in history, towering at over four and\na half feet. It was said he should stop growing as hats would become\nvery expensive.\n\nIn _The Fellowship of the Ring_, he was a worthy accomplice to Merry's\nplans, although he showed his age as well; he was a cheerful if not a\nsometimes thoughtless Hobbit, and seemingly had a knack for doing the\nwrong thing at the wrong time, but throughout _The Lord of the Rings_ he\nbecomes increasingly mature and courageous.\n\n\nWeapons\n\nPippin, like Merry, used swords of the Westernesse they obtained from\nthe Barrow-downs.

Pippin's foolish acts are mainly for comedic relief.\nGenerally weaker than the rest, he does overcome his foolishness and\nbecomes of much use in _The Return of the King_.\n\nIn the _The Lord of the Rings (film)_, Pippin loses his barrow blade and\nreceives a short sword of Gondor, and the helmet and livery of the\nCitadel Guard, originally made for the young Faramir.\n\nVideo games\n\n-   In the _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)_,\n    Pippin's basic speed attack is by far the strongest in the game.

    "text": "TUOR was an Adan of the House of Hador and great hero of Men, the only\nson of Huor and Rían. He was the cousin of Túrin Turambar.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\nTuor was born in FA 472 after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad in which his father\nHuor died. After hearing that the battle was lost, Rían fell into\ndespair and left Dor-lómin while still pregnant with Tuor. She would\nhave been lost and died if not for the Sindar Elves of Mithrim who\nrescued her and took her to their home in the Mountains of Mithrim. Tuor\nwas soon born and first fostered by the Grey-elves. Later, their leader\nAnnael told his mother Rían that Huor had perished in the battle. She\nsoon fell into grief in her early twenties and went to Haudh-En-Ndengin,\nthe Hill of the Slain and seeing the mounds of rotting and despoiled\nremains, she fell sick and died.\n\nWhen the Easterlings came to claim their reward for aiding Morgoth in\nthe Nirnaeth Arnoediad, they occupied Hithlum and captured its people as\ntheir slaves. The Sindar moved their camp into the caves of Androth and\nit was there that Tuor spent his youth. In his sixteenth year, he grew\nangry with the Easterlings and their allies for the evil deeds they had\ndone to his people and wished to fight them. Annael forbid this and Tuor\nobeyed. When the Elven group intended to move to the safer havens in the\nMouths of Sirion through the Gate of the Noldor, Tuor went with them but\nthe group came under attack by Orcs and scattered during the night. Tuor\nwas captured and sent to the Easterlings and sold into slavery.\n\nA Thrall in Hithlum\n\nTuor served the Easterling chief, the brutal Lorgan, who had been sent\nthere by Morgoth and who cruelly oppressed the remnant of the House of\nHador. He worked as a thrall for three years, at which point he had\ngrown to his full stature, and became taller and swifter than any of the\nEasterlings.\n\nA Wandering Outlaw\n\n\n\nTuor then escaped, and lived the life of an outlaw. He travelled down\nHithlum to the Cirith Ninniach, and then through the Gate of the Noldor\ninto Nevrast. At the Gate of the Ñoldor, he met two Noldorin Elves,\nGelmir and Arminas, who showed him the way into Nevrast. He spent the\nrest of the year in Nevrast, until he saw seven swans, and took it as a\nsign that he had tarried too long. He followed these swans down the\ncoast until he reached the ruins of Vinyamar, the previous home of\nTurgon and his people.\n\nAt this point, the Vala Ulmo, Lord of Waters, emerged from the Belegaer\nand appeared to Tuor, bestowing upon him a great cloak to shield him\nfrom the eyes of his enemies, and a quest to remind Turgon of the Doom\nof the Ñoldor, and to warn him of the Fall of Gondolin. He also found\nVoronwë, an Elf of Gondolin, who had been a mariner on the last Noldorin\nvoyage to Valinor, saved from the wrath of Ossë.\n\nTuor and Voronwë then travelled through the Fell Winter past the Pools\nof Ivrin, where they caught a glimpse of Tuor's cousin, Turin, wielding\nGurthang, and making his way towards the wastes of Dor-lomin.\n\nLife in Gondolin\n\n\n\nPassing through the Fell Winter, Tuor and Voronwë eventually arrived in\nGondolin in FA 496. Upon arriving, he proclaimed to have been sent from\nUlmo with a message to Turgon. Seeing Tuor arrayed in the devices of\nUlmo, he was immediately taken to see the king, where he delivered\nUlmo's warning to depart; that Morgoth was coming ever closer to\ndiscovering the location of Gondolin. However, Maeglin argued against\nTuor and Turgon became conflicted. For he had grown to greatly love his\ncity, which was by now as fair as Tirion itself, and he trusted still in\nit's secrecy and strength. As such, he did not evacuate as Ulmo advised.\nHowever, he did not wholly disregard the wisdom of Ulmo, and decreed\nthat none should ever pass out of the Hidden City again. He ordered the\npassage through the Encircling Mountains to be sealed up, and as such\nTuor was forced to remain in Gondolin, though he did so gladly. Tuor\nrose quickly in honor in the city, being of great stature both\nphysically and spiritually and having had the privilege of conversing\ndirectly with Ulmo. Seven years after arriving in Gondolin, Tuor fell in\nlove with King Turgon's Elven daughter, Idril Celebrindal, who loved him\nin return. Turgon, who already considered Tuor as close as kin, gave the\ncouple his blessing. They were wed in a celebration of great happiness,\nand soon after, their only child Eärendil the Mariner was born, who\nhimself became the father of Elrond and Elros.\n\nIn the _Book of Lost Tales_, Part 2 (_The History of Middle-earth_, Vol.\n2), the Elves in Gondolin treated Tuor very highly - “Upon a time the\nking caused his most cunning artificers to fashion a suit of armour for\nTuor as a great gift, and it was made of Ñoldorin steel overlaid with\nsilver, but his helm was adorned with a device of metal and jewels like\ntwo swan-wings, one on either side, and a swan's wing was wrought on his\nshield”. “A house was built for him upon the southern walls, for he\nloved the free airs and liked not the close neigbourhood of other\ndwellings. There it was his delight often to stand on the battlements at\ndawn, and folk rejoiced to see the new light catch the wings of his\nhelm.”\n\n\n\nTuor was one of the leaders of Gondolin during the Fall of Gondolin, and\nfought for the city during the attack by the forces of Morgoth. He\nachieved meritorious deeds including forcing the the great Urulókë to\nretreat. He also stopped attack on his wife and son by Maeglin, which he\nwas able to thwart by throwing him from the walls into a fire.\nAfterwards he, his wife, their son Eärendil, and a remnant of Gondolin's\npeople escaped through a secret way in the mountains and traveled to the\nMouths of Sirion. Longing for the sea, Tuor eventually built the ship\nEärrámë and sailed into the West with Idril.\n\nFaithful hero and Elf-friend he may have been, but he was still a Man\nand therefore mortal. However, the tradition of the Ñoldor was that when\nTuor arrived with Idril in Valinor, bypassing the Ban of the Valar, he\nbecame the only Man to be accepted as one of the elder kindred, and thus\nshared with Beren and Lúthien, who were also granted a second life in\nMiddle-earth, the exceptional fate of an immortal life in Valinor as\nlong as Arda endured. Whether Eärendil ever found or saw his parents\nagain is not known.\n\nIn _The History of Middle-earth_ series story, Tuor and Idril reached\nthe Tower of Pearl on one of the Enchanted Isles in the Shadowy Seas and\neither one or both fell asleep there for an unknown period of\ntime.\n\n\nAppearance\n\nThe only note of Tuor's physical appearance appears in _Unfinished\nTales_, where he is described as “fair of face, and golden-haired after\nthe manner of his father's kin, and he became tall and strong and\nvaliant”.\n\n\nWeapons\n\nIn _The Book of Lost Tales 2_ (_History of Middle-earth_ Vol. 2), it\nsays, \"but he carried an axe rather than a sword, and this in the speech\nof the Gondolindrim he named Dramborleg, for its buffet stunned and its\nedge clove all armour."

    "text": "TURGON was a Ñoldorin Elf of Gondolin, second son of Fingolfin, brother\nof Fingon, Aredhel, Argon, and father of Idril. In Middle-earth, Turgon\nwas the King of Gondolin and the High King of the Ñoldor. For hundreds\nof years of the First Age, Turgon remained successfully hidden from the\neyes and ears of Morgoth until a betrayal from within caused his\ndownfall.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nIn Eldamar Turgon was friendly with the sons of Finarfin and opposed\nFëanor's plan to pursue Morgoth after the theft of the Silmarils, but\neventually he chose to follow them to Middle-earth and became one of the\nexiles. His wife Elenwë was lost crossing Helcaraxë, but Turgon and\nhis daughter Idril came to Nevrast, where he built Vinyamar and gathered\nto him one-third of the Ñoldor of Fingolfin and a large number of\nSindar.\n\nIn the year 50 of the First Age, Turgon was instructed by Ulmo to\nprepare a secret kingdom and was shown the hidden valley of Tumladen in\nthe Encircling Mountains. After 52 years of secret labor, Turgon led his\npeople into Gondolin, where he ruled for over 500 years, largely\nignoring the events of the Wars of Beleriand.\n\nAbout two hundred years after Gondolin was wrought, Turgon's sister\nAredhel journeyed to meet with the Sons of Fëanor. She was lost,\nhowever, and returned with her son Maeglin a few years later. After the\ndeaths of both Eöl and Aredhel, Turgon took Maeglin under his wing and\nmade him the Lord of the House of the Mole. Maeglin secretly loved\nTurgon's daughter Idril, who rejected his advances.\n\nAside from the misadventure of Eöl, the splendor of Turgon's reign in\nGondolin was undisturbed until Dagor Bragollach, when Turgon was brought\nhis father's body by Thorondor. Two years later Thorondor brought him\nHúrin and Huor, whom he fostered for a year and then allowed to return\nto Dor-lómin. At this time, Turgon foresaw the doom of the Ñoldor, and\nhe secretly sent mariners to try to obtain the mercy of the Valar.\nNone of these missions was successful and only one of the mariners,\nVoronwë, survived the Shadowy Seas paving the way for Tuor's coming to\nGondolin.\n\nTurgon joined the Union of Maedhros with a ten thousand strong army and\nfought alongside his brother Fingon in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, but the\nsacrifice of Húrin, Huor, and the Third House of the Edain enabled him\nto retreat without revealing the location of Gondolin. When Tuor came\nto Gondolin in FA 496, Turgon welcomed him, but in his pride, he refused\nto follow the advice of Ulmo to flee to the Havens of Sirion. Now the\nfull malice of Morgoth was directed toward Turgon, last of the House of\nFinwë to control a realm in Middle-earth. At last, aided by the\ntreachery of Maeglin, Morgoth discovered the location of Gondolin, and\nTurgon was slain defending the city.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe first element _tur_ of the name _TURGON_ is a Sindarin word for\n“power, mastery”. His father-name is TURUKÁNO, from _túrë_ (“might,\npower”) and _káno_ (“commander”).\n\n\nCharacter\n\nAs King of Gondolin, Turgon was described to be robed “in white with a\nbelt of gold, and a coronet of garnets was upon his head”.\n\nHe was very much feared by Morgoth, and it is said in Valinor that\nMorgoth knew that from the House of Turgon would his ruin come. This\nholds true, as Turgon's grandson Eärendil was the one who indirectly\ncaused his downfall, in the later War of Wrath.\n\n\nGallery"

    "text": "TÚRIN TURAMBAR was an Adan of the House of Hador and a Man of\nMiddle-earth, who became a tragic hero (or anti-hero) of the First Age,\nin the tale called _Narn i Chîn Húrin_ (“The Tale of the Children of\nHúrin”).\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nTúrin was the only son of Húrin Thalion and Morwen Eledhwen. He had a\nyounger sister Urwen, whom everyone called “Lalaith” because of her\nlaughter. However, she died in childhood of plague. After Húrin was\ncaptured in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Túrin remained with his mother\nMorwen, who hid him from the Easterlings that Morgoth had sent to\nHithlum, fearing they would kill Túrin or enslave him. Unknown to Túrin\nat that time, Morgoth had placed a curse on all of Húrin's family.\n\nHis life in Doriath\n\n\n\nWhen Túrin was eight years old Morwen sent him to Doriath, where he was\nadopted by Thingol as a son. After this Túrin's second sister, Nienor\nwas born. Túrin was restless, and as soon as he was permitted he joined\nBeleg Cúthalion on the marches of Doriath, fighting the orcs of Morgoth.\nHe wore the _Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin_, and the orcs feared him above\nall others.\n\nLife as an Outlaw\n\nTúrin accidentally caused the death of Saeros, one of Thingol's\ncounselors who provoked and attacked him. Before he could be either\npunished or forgiven, he fled, eventually encountering a band of outlaws\nthat dwelt south of Brethil. There he identified himself only as NEITHAN\n(_the wronged_). Túrin killed their leader, and became their leader in\nhis place. During his rule, he stopped the outlaws from raiding houses\nof free folk, and only hunted Orcs.\n\nIn the meantime, Beleg Cúthalion obtained leave by Thingol to seek out\nhis friend. In FA 487, Beleg found Túrin's outlaws at the outskirts of\nAmon Rûdh and was held tied up in question by them until Túrin returned;\nwhen Beleg could not persuade his friend to leave the outlaws, he left\nto return to Doriath. Túrin's band later captured Mîm the Petty-dwarf\nwhile Beleg and Túrin were parted. Mîm was forced to share his halls on\nAmon Rûdh with his company while Túrin promised to repay Mîm for the\naccidental death of his son Khîm.\n\nDeath of Beleg\n\nAt Doriath, Beleg asked to be able to join his friend. Thingol allowed\nthis and also gave him the sword Anglachel, and Thingol's wife Melian\ngave him Lembas. Beleg returned to Túrin that winter, healing those of\nthe band that had become sick with cold. Beleg brought with him the\nDragon-helm, after Turin agreed to take the Dragon-helm, the area around\nAmon Rûdh became known as Dor-Cúarthol, “The Land of Bow and Helm”\n(since Beleg was known as a mighty bowman). There Túrin took the name\nGORTHOL, \"_The Dread Helm\"_. Many warriors joined them, and much of the\nWest of Beleriand was freed from evil for a while.\n\nEventually, Túrin was betrayed by Mîm the dwarf. He was captured at the\ntop of Amon Rûdh and all his men were slain about him. Beleg survived\nand rescued Túrin from the orcs in Taur-nu-Fuin with the help of\nGwindor, an escaped slave of Morgoth, but Túrin accidentally killed\nBeleg with Beleg's sword Anglachel. Beleg , who was trying to cut Túrins\nbonds, was mistaken by Túrin as one of the orcs tormenting him. Thus, he\nroared in fear and killed Beleg and awoke the camp, Gwindor and Túrin\nthen fled. Gwindor led Túrin whose mind was lost in a silent sadness, to\nthe Pools of Ivrin, where he then cried and his madness was cured.\n\nLeader of Nargothrond\n\n\n\nGwindor then led Túrin to Nargothrond, where once he had lived. In\nNargothrond, Túrin hid his name, calling himself by the alias AGARWAEN\nSON OF ÚMARTH (Sindarin for \"_Bloodstained son of Ill-fate\"_), while\nhopeing to hide his identity and escape Morgoth's curse upon his kin. He\nhad Anglachel reforged and named it _Gurthang_, \"_Iron of Death\"_.\nFinduilas, daughter of Orodreth, fell in love with him, but he avoided\nher because she had previously been the beloved of his friend Gwindor.\nTúrin declined to tell her his name, so that she called him THURIN (_the\nsecret_). He was also called ADANEDHEL (_Man-Elf_) because he was so\nlike an elf, though he was human. Gwindor later revealed Túrin's true\nidentity to Finduilas when anger and sadness over took him and it\neventually reached Finduilas' father, King Orodreth.\n\nThe revelation of his identity resulted in Túrin becoming a chief\ncounsellor of Orodreth, and was extremely influential in Nargothrond. He\nencouraged the Nargothrondrim to abandon their practice of secrecy, and\nthey built a great bridge before the gates. Because of his prowess with\nGurthang, he himself became known as the MORMEGIL (_Black Sword_), or\nthe BLACK SWORD OF NARGOTHROND. In FA 495, with Orodreth now deep in the\ncouncil of Túrin, the Elves of Nargothrond marched out from their secret\ncity with an army of some thousands of elves to confront the enemy\nmassing beneath the Ered Wethrin (Mountains of Shadow) and in the Pass\nof Sirion. They were overwhelmed and driven into the Plain of Tumhalad\nand utterly defeated in the Battle of Tumhalad. Only Túrin, who wore the\nDragon Helm of Dor-lómin was able to survive the hot fiery blasts of\nGlaurung and escaped. There was a desperate attempt to destroy the\nbridge Túrin has ordered to be built for swifter actions of the army,\nalas it was too well made and the enemy arrived and Glaurung the father\nof dragons destroyed the gate and the sacking of the once mighty\nNargothrond, began.\n\nThe Dragon's Deceit\n\n\n\nTúrin was caught by the powerful gaze of Glaurung at the smashed gate of\nthe city, and stood by idly as Finduilas and hundreds of captives was\ndragged away, Finduilas called to him, once her cries were drowed out in\nthe distance Túrin was released from Glaurung's spell of which deceived\nTúrin into believing Morwen and Nienor were suffering in Dor-lómin, and\nTúrin abandoned Finduilas to seek out his kin. In actuality, Morwen and\nNienor were safely in Doriath, as Túrin's own efforts had made the way\npassable.\n\nOnce in Dor-lómin, Túrin found his old home empty. He went to the halls\nof the Easterling lord Brodda, who had taken Húrin's kinswoman Aerin as\na wife and many a time beaten her and enslaved Túrin's people, Brodda\nhad also taken Húrin's lands and possessions to which also rightfully\nbelonged to Túrin. From Aerin, Túrin learned that Morwen had left, and\nin his rage, he held Brodda up like a dog and threw him in a group of\nmen breaking his neck killing Brodda, thereby also sealing Aerin's fate.\nAs Túrin left again, Aerin burnt herself alive in Brodda's halls, and\nthe remainder of the House of Hador now was persecuted even with more\ncruelly.\n\nTúrin next tried to find Finduilas, but by the time he picked up the\nOrc's trail he came too late: the woodsmen of Brethil informed him she\nhad been killed as they had tried to rescue the prisoners of\nNargothrond. Túrin collapsed on the mound she was buried in, and was\nbrought to Brethil.\n\nIn Brethil Túrin again took up his life, now calling himself TURAMBAR\n(Master of Doom) in an act of bravado, deciding that his curse was now\nfinally over. One night in the middle of a fierce storm he and his men\nfound a naked young woman on Finduilas's grave, and called her Níniel \"\nMaiden of tears\" for she cried for she knew nothing. Túrin years later\ntook her as his wife. Túrin did not know that this was indeed his\nsister, whose memory had been erased by Glaurung. Brandir, out of\njealousy or forecast, told Niniel that a shadow was cast above Túrin,\nand that instead of being Master of Shadow, the Shadow would inevitably\nmaster him.\n\nSlayer of Glaurung\n\n\n\nTúrin's happiness ended when Glaurung came near Brethil, burning miles\nand miles of forest so that he could reach where the woodsmen lived.\nTúrin with two others set out to kill the dragon, but he was the only\none to reach the drake. Dorlas, being too cowardly, abandoned Túrin, but\nHunthor the faithful went on. As Túrin passed underneath the dragon, he\nnearly toppled into the waters due to the dragon's stench had it not\nbeen for Hunthor, who steadied him. Unfortunately as a result of this\naction a stone moved by Glaurang's passing hit Hunthor on the head, and\nhe fell into the ravine. With his black sword and bitterness in his\nheart, Túrin then stabbed the dragon's belly with all his hatred and\npower; killing Glaurung at Cabed-en-Aras, but was hurt and fell in a\nswoon. As Níniel came to search for him, Glaurung with his last words\nrevealed to her she was his sister. Horrified, Nienor Níniel killed\nherself by leaping into the ravines of the river.\n\nDeath\n\n\n\nWhen Túrin awoke he was told by Brandir the Lame, lord of the Haladin of\nBrethil what had happened, he killed Brandir in anger in front of many\npeople, refusing to believe the truth. When he learned from Mablung of\nDoriath who had come to seek him that Brandir was telling truth and that\nhe had wrongfully slew him, he could no longer live with the pains and\nmisfortunes of his life and decided to take his life. Just before his\ndeath, he revealed that he had been 'blind'; Morgoth's curse had him\ngroping in the dark since childhood.\n\nThen, Turin said to Gurthang: _“Hail Gurthang, iron of death, thou alone\nnow remainest! But what lord or loyalty dost thou know, save the hand\nthat wieldeth thee? From no blood wilt thou shrink! Wilt thou take Tùrin\nTurambar? Wilt thou slay me swiftly?”_\n\n\n\nAnd from the blade rang a cold voice in answer: _“Yea, I will drink thy\nblood, that may I forget the blood of Beleg my master, and the blood of\nBrandir slain unjustly. I will slay thee swiftly.”_ Then Tùrin set the\nhilts upon the ground, and cast himself upon the point of Gurthang, and\nthe black blade took his life. Túrin and several of the others connected\nto his story are some of the few people in the Middle-earth legendarium\nto have committed suicide.\n\nAn alternate interpretation of Túrin's revelation mirrors that of his\nfather's in the Silmarillion, that all that he had seen was twisted by\nthe malice and might of Morgoth, and so as if blind, he stumbled through\nlife.\n\nTúrin was buried near Finduilas' grave, in a high mound where he had\nfallen, and the shards of Gurthang were set beside him.\n\n'And thereon the Elves carved in the Runes of Doriath: TÚRIN TURAMBAR\nDAGNIR GLAURUNGA\n(_Túrin, Master of Fate, Slayer of Glaurung_).\n\nand beneath they wrote also:\n\nNIËNOR NÍNIEL\n\nAftermath\n\nAfter Húrin, Túrin's father, was released from Angband, he and his wife\nMorwen met at the gravesite of their children for the first and last\ntime, and Morwen died when the sun set holding Húrin's hand and was also\nburied there. The mound they were buried beneath survived the War of\nWrath and Tol Morwen was the westernmost isle off the coast of Lindon in\nthe Second and Third Ages.\n\nWhether the tragedies in Túrin's life were the result of Morgoth's curse\nor of his own arrogance, or some combination of the two, are a subject\nof some debate among fans and scholars.\n\n\nLegacy\n\nThe second prophecy of Mandos (later removed from the Silmarillion by\nChristopher Tolkien) states that at the End of Time Morgoth would wage a\nfinal battle against the Valar, the Final Battle, and that Túrin\nTurambar reincarnated would plunge Gurthang into Morgoth's heart and\ndefeat him once and for all, exterminating evil forever, and avenging\nthe Children of Húrin.\n\nThe supposed resemblance of Túrin to figures from medieval tales can be\nconfirmed by part of a letter Tolkien wrote to Milton Waldman, a\npublisher, concerning the publication of his works.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _TÚRIN_ means “he who desires mastery”, from the Sindarin words\n_tûr_ (“power, mastery, lord”) and _ind_ (desire, heart“). In Quenya,\nhis name becomes TURINDO, from _tur_ (”master“) and _indo_ (”mood\").\n\nTURAMBAR means “Master of Doom”, from the Quenya _tur_ (“master”) and\n_ambar_ (“doom”).\n\nOther names\n\n-   Adanedhel, “Man-Elf”\n-   Agarwaen, son of Úmarth, “Bloodstained, son of Ill-fate”\n-   Gorthol, “The Dread Helm”\n-   Mormegil, “Black Sword”\n-   Neithan, “The Wronged”\n-   Thurin, “The Secret”\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\n    ''There is the _Children of Húrin_, the tragic tale of Túrin\n    Turambar and his sister Níniel of which Túrin is the hero: a figure\n    that might be said (by people who like that sort of thing, though it\n    is not very useful) to be derived from elements in Sigurd the\n    Volsung, Oedipus, and the Finnish Kullervo.''\n\nTúrin was a first cousin of Tuor, who was the father of Eärendil. There\nare many parallels between the circumstances of their lives (both lost\ntheir fathers in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, were raised in part by Elves,\nspent time as outlaws and as prisoners, and were war-leaders in the\ngreatest Ñoldorin fortresses, but the outcome of Tuor's life was quite\ndifferent. Even Túrin's coloring was dark, enhancing his resemblance to\nthe Ñoldorin Elves but further setting him apart from his fair-haired\ncousin. The two never actually met, but Tuor did once see his cousin in\npassing (not an everyday occurrence in the wilds of Beleriand).\n\nTúrin also resembles Sigmund, the father of Sigurd in the Volsung saga,\nin the incestuous relationship he has with his sister, which is a\nparallel to the marriage of Túrin and Nienor. In Richard Wagner's opera,\n_Die Walküre_ (also drawn in part from the Volsung myths), Siegmund and\nSieglinde are parallels of Turin and Nienor (one interesting resemblance\nof Túrin to Siegmund is that in the first act of _Die Walkure_, Siegmund\ntells Hunding is name is ''Wehwalt ''(woeful), just as Túrin tells the\nelves of Nargothrond his name is _Agarwaen_ (blood-stained).) Kullervo\nin Kalevala also lost his family in a war. Later on he finds his family\nmembers again. He seduces his sister and afterwards the sister jumps\ninto a river, like Nienor in Teiglin. Afterwards, he commits suicide\nexactly like Túrin did. Kullervo asks for his sword to kill him, and the\nsword replies just as Gurthang did. Then Kullervo throws himself onto\nthe sword and dies."

    "text": "_Disambiguation: For King Óin, father of King Náin II, see Óin (King\n    of Durin's Folk)._\n\nÓIN was a Dwarf of Durin's Folk known for being a part of Thorin and\nCompany during the Quest of Erebor.\n\n\nBiography\n\nThird Age\n\nÓin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and\nuncle of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling.\nÓin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield,\nand in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim\nthe Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves\nwho bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely\nMountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing\nthe fire for the Company. He fought in and survived the Battle of the\nFive Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain along with many\nother of the Dwarves of The Company of Thorin such as Bombur.\n\nLater Years\n\nForty-eight years later, in TA 2989, Óin went to Moria with Balin and\nothers to recover the realm for the Dwarves of Durin's Folk. After Balin\nbecame Lord of Moria, according to the Book of Mazarbul Óin was sent to\nthe Upper Armories of the Third Deep (Hall ?) which was apparently\nwestwards of the Hollin gate. While there, the Orcs of Moria attacked\nfive years later. The Dwarves could not escape by the eastern gate\nbecause the Orcs held the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, so they tried to escape\nby the Hollin Gate (the west gate out of Moria). But the water outside\nthe door was right up to the wall, and the Watcher in the Water took\nÓin. He was likely ripped apart and eaten.\n\n\nPortrayal in Adaptations\n\n\n\nIn Peter Jackson's _The Hobbit_ film trilogy, Óin is portrayed by John\nCallen. Although hard of hearing and requiring an ear trumpet to aid him\n(which is later trodden on by one of the goblins in Goblin-town), Óin is\nas fierce a warrior as the other members of Thorin's party and is\nlethally proficient with his iron-headed staff (in one scene he is shown\nswinging it over his head multiple times, bashing numerous goblins at\nonce).  According to the studio release,\n\n_“Along with his brother Glóin, Óin was a distant cousin of Thorin\nOakenshield. A brave Northern Dwarf, Óin joins The Company of Thorin\nOakenshield out of a sense of loyalty to his kin, and also because he\nhas a substantial sum of money invested in the venture. Well read, with\nan inquiring mind, Óin was the healer among the Company, often applying\nan herbal salve of his own invention – which has since come to be known\nas 'ointment' after its maker.”_\n\nIn _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey: A Visual Companion_, writer Jude\nFisher added additional background information, including the fact that\nÓin often acts as a midwife on those rare occasions when a Dwarf woman\ngives birth. Rumor has it that he personally delivered his nephew,\nGimli, and dropped him on his head. His son is Gori.\n\nCo-writer (of Peter Jackson 's Hobbit film trilogy) Guillermo Del Torro\nadded Óin's ear trumpet as a pun, as Óin means “they hear” in Spanish. \n\nIn _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_, he decides to stay in\nLake-town with Fíli and Kíli after the latter is poisoned by an orc\narrow during their escape from Mirkwood, remarking that his duty is to\nthe sick. As he attempts to bring Kíli's fever down he asks Bard for\nsome kingsfoil, which Bard says is a weed they use to feed the pigs,\nprompting Bofur to go and find some. Later Tauriel treats Kíli's wound\nwith kingsfoil, after which Óin remarks to Fíli that he has heard of the\nwonders of elvish medicine, and regards it as a privilege to see it in\naction.\n\nMedical Skills\n\nÓin is portrayed as a medic to the company in the films. He is seen at\ndifferent times in the films holding various bottles and jars. In these\njars he supposedly keeps natural remedies and ointment (appropriately\nnamed after him). Later on in the second film he stays behind in Lake\nTown with an injured Kili, having being pierced by a morgul shaft. When\nThorin asks Óin to join him in coming to the Mountain, he says, “my duty\nlies with the wounded”."

    "text": "GOLDBERRY, also called THE RIVER-DAUGHTER, was the wife of Tom Bombadil\nin the Old Forest at the edge of Buckland.\n\n\nBiography\n\nThe character Goldberry, like Tom Bombadil, is a kind of nature spirit\npersonified; most Tolkien scholars presume both Bombadil and Goldberry\nto be Maiar of the Ainur race, but this is not explicitly supported in\nthe text of _The Lord of the Rings_. Tom Bombadil would refer to her\noften as the _River-daughter,_ said she was the “River-woman's\ndaughter,” and said he found her long ago by the pool where he gathered\nwater-lilies from the Withywindle river. She had long yellow hair and\nher voice was beautiful, “as young and as ancient as spring, like the\nsong of a glad water flowing down into the night from a bright morning\nin the hills.”\n\nGoldberry hosted the Hobbits Frodo Baggins, Meriadoc Brandybuck,\nPeregrin Took, and Samwise Gamgee when Tom Bombadil brought them to his\nhouse after rescuing them from the perils of Old Man Willow in the Old\nForest. They found her to be as mysterious as Tom, but were grateful for\nher kindness to them and were enchanted by her presence. When they first\nsaw her she was wearing a gown “green as young reeds, shot with silver\nlike beads of dew; and her belt was of gold, shaped like a chain of\nflag-lilies set with the pale-blue eyes of forget-me-nots.” She was\nstanding amid wide vessels of green and brown earthenware in which\n“white water-lilies were floating, so that she seemed to be enthroned in\nthe midst of a pool.”\n\nAfter rescuing the Hobbits from the Barrow-downs, Tom Bombadil selected\na brooch with blue stones from the hoard of the Barrow-wights to give\nGoldberry.\n\n\nNotes on origin\n\nIn _The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien_, Tolkien describes Goldberry as the\nseasonal changes in nature, and Tom Bombadil as the nature spirit of the\nEnglish countryside.\n\nTolkien based his mythic personages on Eurasian myth and cosmology. The\nGreat Goddess who is mother of all things was, before Time existed, the\nelement of water, undifferentiated. Time begins when her first offspring\nis born, and, according to Tom Bombadil, he is the Eldest, the\nfirstborn. The River is the local manifestation of the primal Great\nGoddess, and Goldberry is her daughter, the spirit of all local waters\nexisting in Time, alive and embodied.\n\nBoth Tom and Goldberry are primal spirits of nature, he of the land and\nits produce and she of the water. In early Eurasian myth, the element\nof water is feminine and the land or earth is masculine; therefore,\nGoldberry represents the female principle of life while Tom represents\nthe male. Together as husband and wife they are the totality of\nprimal Nature, endlessly proceeding in an eternal circle from season to\nseason forever.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nRadio\n\nGoldberry is heard in The Lord of the Rings (1956 radio series) and is\npossibly voiced by Nicolette Bernard. In the Tales from the Perilous\nRealm (1992 radio series) she is voiced by Sorcha Cusack. She also\nappears in the The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video\ngame) and is voiced by Kath Soucie. Goldberry has recently been adapted\ninto a short film, featured on TheOneRing.net.\n\n\nGallery"

    "race": "Human",
    "text": "GRÍMA WORMTONGUE was the chief advisor to King Théoden of\nRohan before being exposed as an agent and spy of Saruman. He ends up\nbeing the killer of Saruman, in the last climactic chapter of _The\nReturn of the King_.\n\n\nBiography\n\nLittle is known of Gríma before he became counselor of Théoden in\nEdoras. His childhood is a mystery. What is known is that Gríma, son of\nGálmód, and a native of Rohan, joined the service of Saruman in secret\nand worked as a spy to weaken Théoden and his kingdom, using his voice\nto keep the spell intact while Saruman is inside the King.\n\n\n\nIt is likely that Saruman had promised him Éowyn, the king's niece, as a\nreward for his services; in the novel, Wormtongue is accused of\n“watching her under his lids and haunting her steps” and in the film, he\nmakes clumsy romantic overtures to her as she weeps for her dead cousin\nThéodred. He also exiles Éowyn's brother Éomer and his army from Rohan,\nonly saying that he sees “too much” after Éomer says, “Too long have you\nwatched my sister, too long have you haunted her steps”. It is also\npossible that he has Dunlending ancestry, since he is darker-haired and\nphysically smaller than the other Rohirrim.\n\n\n\nAfter Gandalf usurps Gríma's control of Théoden and releases the King,\n“many things which men had missed” were found locked in his trunk,\nincluding Herugrim, the blade of Théoden. With his betrayal revealed,\nThéoden presents Gríma with a choice: either ride into battle for the\nKing or be exiled. Choosing the latter, he went to dwell with Saruman at\nOrthanc. In the book, Gríma arrived at Orthanc after the battle of the\nEnts, but in the movie, he was there before the battle began. There,\nGríma gave Saruman important information about Théoden's plans to leave\nEdoras with his people suspecting an attack would come, and that they\nwould flee to Helm's Deep, the main fortress of Rohan, where the Battle\nof the Hornburg would be fought. Later, Saruman had cause to regret\nGríma's dwelling in Orthanc when, following the confrontation between\nSaruman and Gandalf, he foolishly threw a “heavy rock”— which was\nactually the _Palantír_ of Orthanc at either Gandalf or Saruman (it is\nstated that “he couldn't decide which he hated most”), an act for which\nSaruman seems to have punished him severely (Pippin picked up the\nPalantír). Saruman was also said to have scalped Gríma and beaten him\nover time.\n\nGríma then accompanied Saruman to the Shire, where the two sought\nrevenge in petty tyranny over the hobbits (though Saruman had already\nbeen exerting control from afar by sending evil Men to the Shire).\nDuring this time, Gríma became increasingly degraded until he was a\ncrawling wretch, a beggar, almost resembling Gollum, and Saruman\nshortened his nickname to “Worm”. Gríma killed Lotho Sackville-Baggins\nand may have eaten him, which he claims to have done in the book under\nSaruman's orders.\n\nSpurred by the words of Frodo that he did not have to follow Saruman,\nand having been pushed over the edge when Saruman scorned him, Gríma\nused a hidden knife to slit Saruman's throat, killing him (only in the\nbook). He then tried to make his escape, but was quickly killed by\nseveral arrows fired from the hobbits present, ending his short and\nunhappy life.\n\n\nUnfinished Tales\n\n\n\nGríma actually played a major role in the story of The Lord of the Rings\nprior to his first appearance in The Two Towers. In Unfinished Tales,\nTolkien writes that on the 20th of September in 3018 Gríma was captured\nby the Nazgûl in the fields of Rohan, while on his way to Isengard to\ninform Saruman of Gandalf's arrival at Edoras. He was interrogated and\ndivulged what he knew of Saruman's plans to the Nazgûl, specifically his\ninterest in the Shire, and its location. Previously, the location of the\nShire had been unknown to the Nazgûl, but they knew it to be the home of\n'Baggins', whom they thought still had the Ring.\n\nGríma was set free, but only because the Lord of the Nazgûl saw that he\nwould not dare tell anyone of their meeting and might do harm to Saruman\nin the future. The Nazgûl set out immediately for the Shire. Had the\nRingwraiths not captured Gríma, they would instead have pursued Gandalf\ninto Rohan, and possibly not have found the Shire until much later,\ngiving the Hobbits and then the Fellowship a considerable head start.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nRalph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings film\n\nIn Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film of The Lord of the Rings, Gríma\nWormtongue was voiced by Michael Deacon (and his name is pronounced as\n“Gree-ma”). Here he is much smaller than is implied in the book. Paul\nBrooke played Gríma in BBC Radio's 1981 serialisation.\n\nPeter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy\n\n\n\nIn Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films, Gríma was played by Brad\nDourif.  Here, he is depicted as dark-haired, emaciated and eyebrowless,\nwearing black robes with dark fur, as well as being extremely pale and\ngaunt (the only detail coming from the book). According to Dourif,\nJackson encouraged him to shave off his eyebrows so that the audience\nwould immediately have a subliminal reaction of unease to the\ncharacter. \n\nThe “Scouring of the Shire” episode does not appear in the film version,\nso the deaths of Saruman and Gríma have been moved to an earlier scene,\n“The Voice of Saruman”. This scene was cut from the theatrical releases\nof the films, but can be found on the Extended Edition DVD of _The\nReturn of the King_.\n\n\n\nIn this scene, the assembled leaders of the West ride to Ent-occupied\nIsengard to confront Saruman. Théoden offers to forgive Gríma for his\ntreachery, pointing out that he was not always a villain, as he was\nmanipulated by Saruman (as Théoden himself was). Gríma goes to accept\nthe offer, attempting to escape Saruman's cruelty, but Saruman\ninterferes, claiming that Gríma belongs to him forever. When Gríma\nobjects, Saruman slaps him violently to the ground. Enraged at being\nconstantly ill-treated by his enslaver, Gríma rises and stabs Saruman\ntwice in the back with a dagger. Saruman's body then falls from the\ntower and is impaled on a spiked wheel, a remnant of his war machines,\nand the Palantír slips out of his cloak. Gríma himself is shot with an\narrow fired by Legolas, who had hoped to prevent him from killing\nSaruman (who was in the process of revealing vital information). He dies\nof his wound.\n\nOther than the location, the manner of the characters' deaths is very\nmuch the same. As in the book, Gríma kills Saruman, not by stabbing him\nin the back, but slitting his throat (probably because this would have\nbeen too graphic for a PG-13 movie), and then shot with an arrow by\nLegolas (in the book, a hobbit). This scene was to have included a line\nwhere Saruman blamed Gríma for killing Théodred; replacing Lotho in the\ncontext of that scene, but the line was cut out. However, the line is\nincluded in a scene in the The Lord of the Rings: Gameboy Advance\nversion of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers after the player\ndefeats Saruman in the Tower of Orthanc."

    "name": "Gollum",
    "lotrUrl": "https://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Gollum",
    "race": "Hobbit",
    "text": "GOLLUM, originally known as SMÉAGOL (or TRAHALD), was at first a\nStoor, one of the three early Hobbit-types. The name _Gollum_ was\nderived from the sound of his disgusting gurgling, choking cough. His\nbirth can be estimated to have happened in the year TA 2430. His death\ndate is given as March 25, 3019. His life was extended far beyond its\nnatural limits by the effects of possessing the One Ring. At the time of\nhis death, Sméagol was about 589 years old, a remarkable age for a\ncreature that was once a Hobbit, but he had been deformed and twisted in\nboth body and mind by the corruption of the Ring. His chief desire was\nto possess the Ring that had enslaved him, and he pursued it for many\nyears after Bilbo Baggins found it while walking in the Misty Mountains\nin the book _The Hobbit_. In the movies, he was a\ndeuteragonist-turned-secondary antagonist.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\n\n Once a predecessor of the Stoorish Hobbits, Sméagol\nspent the early years of his life living with his extended family under\na Matriarch, his grandmother. Around the year TA 2463, Sméagol became\nthe fourth Bearer of the One Ring, after Sauron, Isildur, and Déagol.\nDéagol was his cousin, and on Sméagol's birthday, they went fishing in\nthe Gladden Fields north of the mountains. It was there that Déagol\nfound a gold ring, after being pulled into the water by a large fish.\nAlmost immediately, Sméagol fell to the power of the ring and demanded\nit as a birthday present. When Deágol refused, Sméagol promptly flew\ninto a barbaric rage and fought with Deagol over the ring, choking him\nto death and taking the ring as his own. Sméagol was quickly corrupted\nfurther by the ring and banished by his people; turned by his\ngrandmother out of her hole, he was forced to find a home in a cave in\nthe Misty Mountains in around TA 2470. The Ring's malignant influence\ntwisted his Hobbit body, as well as his mind, and prolonged his life far\nbeyond its natural limits. He called it his “Precious” or his “Birthday\nPresent,” the latter as a justification for killing Déagol.\n\nLife under the Misty Mountains\n\n He lived in the Misty Mountains for over four\nhundred years, living on raw blind fish (which he caught from his small\nrow boat), bats and Goblins when he could get them. Indeed, he made a\nsong about raw fish, that he uses as a riddle to Bilbo and much later\nsings to Frodo in a longer version. In later years, he found Hobbit and\nElven food repulsive.\n\nDuring his centuries under the Ring's influence, he developed a sort of\ndissociative identity disorder: Sméagol, his “good” personality, still\nvaguely remembered things like friendship and love, while Gollum, his\n“bad” personality, was a slave to the Ring and would kill anyone who\ntried to take it. Years later, Samwise Gamgee would name the good\npersonality “Slinker” (for his fawning, eager-to-please demeanor), and\nthe bad personality “Stinker”. The two personalities often quarreled\nwhen he talked to himself (as Tolkien put it, “through not having anyone\nelse to speak to”) and had a love/hate relationship, mirroring Gollum's\nlove and hatred for the Ring and for himself.\n\n\n\nIn July, TA 2941, during the Quest of Erebor, the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins\nstumbled upon the subterranean lake on which he lived and found Gollum's\nRing. Gollum had lost the Ring while squabbling with an imp goblin in\nthe network of caves leading to the lake, though in fact it is more\nproper to say that the Ring abandoned Gollum, for it was known to have a\nwill of its own. As Gandalf says later, it looks after itself, trying to\nget back to Sauron. After the infamous Riddle Game, during which Gollum\nwas unaware of his loss, Gollum refused to show Bilbo the promised way\nout and plotted to murder him. When he went to get his “birthday\npresent,” however, he found that it was gone. He suddenly realized the\ntrue answer to Bilbo's last riddle—_“What have I got in my pocket?”_ -,\nbreaking into a rage and then begun to chase him in the tunnels. Bilbo\ninadvertently stumbled across the Ring's power of invisibility as he\nran, allowing him to follow Gollum to the back entrance of the\ncave. There, Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum, but was overcome\nwith pity, so he jumped over him to escape. As Bilbo ran, Gollum cried\nout, “Thief! Thief, Baggins! We hates it forever!”; he did not\nimmediately follow Bilbo out of fear of being caught by the goblins, and\nso lingered in his cave.\n\nSearch for the Ring\n\nGollum eventually left the Mountains and pursued Bilbo a few years\nlater, but the trail was cold. He made his way south into Mordor where\nall evil was being drawn at the time, discovering the secret stair\nlocated near Minas Morgul and surviving an encounter with Shelob. He was\ncaptured on his return, taken to the dungeons of Barad-dur and forced to\nreveal to Sauron under intense torture what he knew about the Ring.\nGollum was then strangely freed, as he shows no particular loyalty\ntowards Sauron, but caught by Aragorn, then interrogated by Gandalf, who\nplaced him in the care of the Silvan Elves living in Thranduil's kingdom\nin Mirkwood. Assisted by Orcs he escaped them, and set off looking for\nthe Shire. He passed through Moria, but could not make it out of the\nEast gate. Seemingly he then just waited there until he got lucky when\nthe Fellowship passed through. However, as Frodo was a ring-bearer he\nmight have foreseen the passing of the ring. Alternatively, some of\nSaruman's or Sauron's spies may have revealed to him the Fellowship was\nheading towards Moria.\n\nThe War of the Ring\n\n\n\nGollum met and started following the Fellowship of the Ring in Moria,\nand was spotted and heard by Frodo on several occasions. On January 15,\n3019, the Fellowship was divided when Gandalf disappeared while fighting\na Balrog (though he later returned). Gollum continued trailing the\nremaining members. It is unknown how he crossed the Bridge of\nKhazad-dûm, but he came with them to Lórien without their knowing.\nGollum followed their boats down Anduin (floating on a log) to Rauros\nand pursued Frodo and Sam across the Emyn Muil when they struck out on\ntheir own towards Mordor. Gollum followed them, but after a\nconfrontation (in which he bit and nearly strangled Sam for the Ring)\nFrodo subdued him and threatened to kill him with Sting, the Elvish\nblade that Gollum had apparently recognized by its former owner - Bilbo.\nFrodo tied an Elven Rope around Gollum's neck for a leash, but the mere\ntouch of the rope pained him. Taking pity on the wretched creature,\nFrodo made Gollum swear to help them. Agreeing to the oath, Gollum swore\nby the “Precious” itself and Frodo released him. The unlikely company,\nguided by Gollum, made its way to the Black Gate, the entrance to\nMordor.\n\n\n\nAlong the way, it was revealed that Gollum, having lived in a cave for\nhundreds of years, feared both the sun and the moon, calling them the\n'Yellow Face' and the 'White Face' respectively.\n\nFrodo's kindness brought out the “Sméagol” personality, and he made at\nleast some effort to keep his promise. The two had a strange sort of\nbond from both having been Ring-bearers; in Gollum, Frodo saw his\npossible future, and so wanted to save him so he could save himself.\nApart from Gandalf and Bilbo, Frodo is the only person known to have\nshown kindness towards Gollum, who is hated instantly by everyone he\nmeets, being perceived as filthy, slimy, sneaky and suspect by groups as\ndifferent as the Orcs of Cirith Ungol and the Rangers of Ithilien.\n\nWhen the Black Gate was reached and found to be well guarded, Gollum\nconvinced them not to go that way, saying that they would be caught and\nSauron would regain the Ring. Gollum said he would lead them south,\nwhere he knew of another entrance into Mordor, in which Frodo complied,\ndespite Sam's suspicions.\n\nFrodo and Sam were caught by Faramir, and Gollum followed them. When\nFrodo allowed Faramir to briefly take Gollum prisoner, however, he felt\nbetrayed, allowing the “Gollum” personality to take total\ncontrol. Faramir found out that the place Gollum was taking them was\ncalled Cirith Ungol. He then warned Frodo and Sam of the evil of that\nplace.\n\nFrodo, Sam, and Gollum left Faramir and began crossing the Morgul Vale\nand proceeded to climb the stairs of Cirith Ungol, in the\nborder-mountains of the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow). Gollum\nvisited the great spider Shelob, child of Ungoliant, because he was\nplanning to betray the Hobbits by turning them to Shelob for food and\nthen take the Ring for himself. The fact that Gollum managed to forge an\nalliance with Shelob is also remarkable, as she was otherwise known for\ndevouring and killing everything on sight. When he returned the Hobbits\nwere asleep. The sight of Frodo sleeping nearly moved Gollum to repent,\nas he began to pet Frodo's hair. However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly\nto Gollum and all hope of redemption was lost. Gollum followed through\nwith his plan and led Frodo and Sam into Torech Ungol.\n\nJust as Frodo warned him, Gollum's betrayal of his oath ultimately led\nto his undoing, for Frodo and Sam escaped from her lair and also Cirith\nUngol. They came against all odds to the fiery volcano Mount Doom.\nGollum followed them all the way, seeking a chance to surprise them and\ntake the Ring. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination,\nhe attacked, but failed to get the Ring. Sam, who had hated Gollum on\nsight, tried to bring himself to kill him, but he relented out of sheer\npity and disgust, turning his back on the beaten (but still wily)\ncreature.\n\nDeath\n\nMoments later, Frodo was standing on the edge of the Crack of Doom, but,\nunwilling to destroy the Ring, claimed it for himself and put it on.\nThen Gollum attacked the hobbits again. Gollum knocked out Sam with a\nrock whilst Frodo was invisible. But Gollum was able to track his\nfootprints and jumped on Frodo. The two fought and finally Gollum bit\noff Frodo's finger with the ring on it.\n\n\n\nHere Bilbo's long-ago kindness in sparing Gollum's life was rewarded,\nfor Gollum then teetered on the edge of the great pit, lost his balance\nand fell in, (In the movie Frodo assaults Gollum, and he trips) taking\nthe Ring and finger with him along with a final cry of “_Precious_!”.\nThe ring was burned in the molten lava with Gollum consumed with it as\nwell. Had Gollum not lived to play this final part, there was a good\nchance that Sauron would have regained his Ring, as he knew where Frodo\nwas as soon as he put it on.\n\nLegacy\n\nYears after Gollum's death, Frodo would forgive him, as Gandalf had told\nFrodo that Gollum wasn't actually an evil being that deserved his death,\nbut was only a poor being, bound to the Ring's will, and that Frodo's\nfate would be like Gollum's if he kept the Ring. For if Gollum did not\nstay with Sam and Frodo to the end of Mordor, Frodo's inability to\ndestroy the Ring would have alerted Sauron to it, and all good in the\nworld of Middle-earth would disappear.\n\nGollum was also remembered for being the Ring-bearer that kept the Ring\nfor about five hundred years, the second longest bearer besides Sauron\nhimself, who bore it from SA 1600 to his defeat in SA 3441. He is also\nremarkable for having seen Sauron in person (when being tortured by him)\nand for managing to form an alliance with Shelob. As a traveller,\nexplorer and Ranger he is perhaps the equal of Aragorn and Gandalf,\neasily travelling alone through extremely hostile terrains, and\nseemingly having travelled very widely. For instance, he found his own\nway through the Dead Marshes as well as discovering for himself the\nsecret pass of Cirith Ungol. Also he manages to find his way through\nMoria from the East entrance to the West gate, something which even\nGandalf did only with some difficulty.\n\nIronically the one being who suffered the most from the One Ring was the\none who manages to destroy it in the end. Gollum or Sméagol undoubtedly\nsuffered the most from the One Ring as for almost all his unnaturally\nlong life he is tortured by the ring past insanity into total mental\ndestruction.\n\n\nBackground\n\nIn the first edition of _The Hobbit_, Gollum did not appear quite as\nwretched or as bound to the Ring. Tolkien revised this characterization\nto fit the concept of the Ruling Ring developed during the writing of\n_The Lord of the Rings_. Tolkien then explained the version given in the\nfirst edition as a lie that Bilbo made up to tell the Dwarves and\nGandalf.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nIn the first edition of The Hobbit, Tolkien made no reference to his\nsize, leading several illustrators to portray him as being very large.\nTolkien realized the omission, and clarified in later editions that he\nwas of average hobbit size and in “The Lord of the Rings”, there is a\nreference to Sam being “little less in height” than he is. Tolkien\ndescribes Gollum as either dark, bone-white or sallow (pale yellow): at\none point, the Men of Ithilien mistake his silhouette (seen from a\ndistance) for a tailless black squirrel. Gorbag and Shagrat describe him\nas a dark fellow. In a manuscript written to guide illustrators to the\nappearance of his characters, Tolkien explained this by saying that\nGollum had pale skin, but wore dark clothes and was often seen in poor\nlight. The Hobbit states he has pockets, in which he keeps a tooth\nsharpening rock, goblin teeth, wet shells, and a scrap of bat wing.\nDespite these details, he is generally depicted wearing a loincloth or\nnaked in illustrations and adaptations.\n\n\n\nGollum was a good survivor and was very keen eyed and quick of hand this\nmade him an excellent fisherman. He could spot and catch fish in almost\nany level of light and waters. He fished the waters of the Misty\nMountain's underground lake for centuries in almost complete darkness\nand almost anywhere he had to after leaving his cave in search of the\nRing and the thief Baggins. He was known to eat almost anything that was\nliving or edible and could stomach anything raw and uncooked. He was\nalso very good at not being seen and was an excellent waterman making\nuse of anything that could float which made it possible for him to\nfollow the Fellowship for so long.\n\n\nPronunciation\n\nIn both the 1981 BBC radio adaptation and in the Peter Jackson\nmovies, _Sméagol_ is pronounced as “SMEE-gol”, although the placement of\nthe acute accent suggests that the correct pronunciation is\n“SMAY-uh-gol”, IPA . On the other hand, in Tolkien's recordings of _The\nLord of the Rings_ he also pronounced it “SMEE-gol” or “SMEE-AH-GOL” ,\nsuggesting that _éa_ should either be pronounced as a hard “e”-sound or\nas a diphthong _ea_, and not as two distinct vowels “e” and “a”. Tolkien\nhad a habit in his writing to put diacritics in varying places, as can\nalso be seen in the name _Eärendil_, which also occurs spelt _Ëarendil_.\nIt should also be noted that “Sméagol” bears strong resemblance to Old\nEnglish _smēaġan_, a verb meaning “to ponder”. If this was Tolkien's\nintention, then the acute may have been meant to substitute for the\nmacron. In any case, when trying to pronounce _Sméagol_, it should be\nkept in mind that the pronunciation rules given in the Appendices for\n_The Lord of the Rings_ are for the Elvish languages, and not for (old)\nEnglish representing Westron and related languages.\n\nSméagol's “real” Westron name was _Trahald_, of the meaning \"burrowing,\nworming in or “apt to creep into a hole”. In both Westron and Old\nEnglish, Sméagol's name is related to Smaug's: Smaug's name in “true\nDalish” was _Trâgu_, and the Trah- stem in Trahald and Trâgu is thus a\ncognate of the Germanic stem present in both Sméagol, and Smaug (with a\nmeaning of squeezing through a hole.)\n\n\nAppearances in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Hobbit_\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n\nIn the films\n\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n-   _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nRalph Bakshi version\n\n\n\nIn both Ralph Bakshi's animated film of _The Lord of the Rings_ (1978)\nand the BBC's 1981 radio serial, the voice of Gollum is supplied by\nPeter Woodthorpe.\n\n\n\nIn the animated versions of both _The Hobbit_ and _The Return of the\nKing_, Gollum was voiced by comedian Brother Theodore.\n\nLord of the Rings film trilogy\n\nIn the Peter Jackson film trilogy, Gollum is a CGI creature voiced by\nactor Andy Serkis, who also provided the voices of some of the Nazgûl\nand Orcs. Barely glimpsed in _The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of\nthe Ring_ (2001), he becomes a central character in _The Lord of the\nRings: The Two Towers_ (2002) and _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of\nthe King_ (2003). The groundbreaking CGI character was built around\nSerkis' voice, movements and expressions, sometimes by using a motion\ncapture suit which recorded his movements and applied them to the\ndigital character, and sometimes by the more laborious process of\ndigitally “painting out” Serkis's image and replacing it with Gollum's,\ngiving the appearance of a small, skeletal, thin and gaunt creature with\nlarge, beady eyes and small strands of brown hair. In one such shot in\n_The Two Towers_, Serkis' real spittle can be seen emerging from\nGollum's mouth.\n\nIn _The Return of the King,_ Serkis himself appears in flashback scene\nas Sméagol before his degeneration into Gollum. This scene was\noriginally earmarked for _The Two Towers_ but held back because it was\nfelt that audiences would relate better to the original Sméagol once\nthey were more familiar with who he became. The decision to include this\nscene meant that Gollum's face had to be redesigned for the second and\nthird movies so that it would more closely resemble Serkis'. (The brief\nglimpses in _The Fellowship of the Ring_ are of an older portrayal of\nGollum.)\n\nAndy Serkis reprised his role of Gollum for one of the three part Hobbit\nfilms.\n\nRadio\n\n-   In the 1955 radio series, Gollum was voiced by\n-   In the 1968 radio series, Gollum was voiced by\n-   In the 1979 radio series, Gollum was voiced by\n-   In the 1981 radio series, Gollum was voiced by\n\nVideo games\n\n_Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor_\n\nAppearance\n\n\n\nIn the Jackson adaptation of The Two Towers, Faramir describes him as\n“having an ill-favored look.”He was also very thin and only had six\nteeth (in the The Hobbit (films) saying 9), comparing him to Shelob; one\nof the Orcs describes him as “rather like a spider himself, or perhaps\nlike a starved frog.” Gollum's toughness is said to stem from his hobbit\nroots. Gollum hates light, and avoids it if possible. He is emaciated\nand gaunt, but possesses a vicious, wiry strength; Aragorn states, “his\nmalice gives him a strength hardly to be imagined.” In The Two Towers,\nGollum's grip is described as “soft, but horribly strong” as Gollum\nwrestles with Sam Gamgee. He is also able to climb effortlessly straight\ndown cliffs impossible to climb by Sam and Frodo, and can make long\nleaps. Additionally he can run extremely fast, strangely on all fours.\nGollum prefers to eat meat raw, and refuses to eat anything Elvish\nbecause it apparently burns him to the touch.\n\nHis appearance was originally to be bigger and more menacing, like Smaug\nin the Hobbit trilogy, but were changed to make their “characters”.\n\n-   Gollum will make an appearance in Lego Dimensions"

    "text": "_'Radagast (ADÛNAIC; IPA:  - “TENDER OF BEASTS”) the Brown_',\nalso called '''Aiwendil '''(Quenya; IPA:  -\n“Bird-Friend”) was one of the five Wizards, or _Istari_. He was a good\nfriend of Gandalf the Grey, whom he aided occasionally. Radagast was\nmainly concerned with the well-being of the plant and animal worlds, and\nthus did not participate heavily in the War of the Ring.  \n\n\nBiography\n\nYears of the Lamps\n\n\n\nRadagast was originally a Maia of Yavanna the Fruit-Giver named\nAIWENDIL, meaning “bird-friend”. In Valinor, the land of the Valar, a\ncouncil was called by Manwë, leader of the Valar, shortly after Sauron's\ndefeat in the War of the Last Alliance. Though Sauron was overthrown, it\nwould later turn out that he had not been effectively vanquished and his\nshadow began to fall upon Middle-earth a second time. It was decided to\nsend five emissaries to Middle-earth. These should be “mighty peers of\nSauron, yet forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh,” as they were\nintended to help Men and Elves unite against Sauron, but the wizards\nwere forbidden from matching the Dark Lord in power and fear.\n\nThe other four who were chosen were Gandalf, Saruman,\nand Alatar and Pallando (the Blue Wizards). Yavanna subsequently begged\nCurumo to take Aiwendil with him.\n\nArrival in Middle-earth\n\nAround the year 1000, the Maiar arrived at the Grey Havens in the west\nof Eriador upon the shores of Middle-earth, having the form of old Men,\nwhom the peoples called _Wizards_. Curumo arrived first and alone, and\nAiwendil arrived at the same time as Olórin.\n\nAiwendil, renamed Radagast, meaning “tender of beasts”, by the Ñoldor,\nprotects the great forests. He was little concerned with the affairs of\nMen and Elves but was far more knowledgeable in plants, birds and beasts\nin the forest. He also turned away from Saruman during this period,\nunaware that he despised him and considered him a fool.\n\nSecond Age\n\nWhen the Wizards took their mission they roamed Middle-earth, but\nRadagast was never much of a traveller. There is not much to be told\nabout his early journeys.\n\nThird Age\n\n\n\nIn _The Hobbit_, Gandalf says that Radagast is his cousin, though\nthis more likely refers to their friendship or the fact that they are\nboth Wizards, and not actual close kinship, except in that they are both\nMaiar.\n\nBy the late Third Age he eventually settled down and dwelt, for a time\nat least, at Rhosgobel somewhere between the Carrock and the Old Forest\nRoad. Situated on the western borders of Mirkwood, it can be assumed\nthat the Wizard held watch against the Shadow of Dol Guldur that slowly\nengulfed the forest. It is likely that he became acquainted with the\ninhabitants of that region. Close to animals and birds, he was friends\nwith the Great Eagles. Although the neighboring Beorn was unsociable,\nhe used to see him from time to time, and he considered Radagast “not\nbad” for a Wizard.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nIn 2851 the White Council met once more and, after that, Saruman began\nto search the Gladden Fields for the One Ring. Radagast decided to aid\nhis search with birds and beasts who acted as spies hoping that\nSaruman's actions would help watch and hinder Sauron. Radagast did this\nin good faith, knowing nothing of Saruman's real ambitions to keep the\nRing for himself.\n\nBy the time of the War of the Ring Radagast did not dwell any more in\nRhosgobel. In summer 3018 Saruman told Radagast that he was willing to\nhelp Gandalf, and sent the Brown Wizard to seek him out at once.\nRadagast did not know much of Eriador but sought for the Shire, knowing\nthat he would find Gandalf nearby.\n\nIndeed, on Midsummer's Day, Radagast was sitting on the side of the\nGreenway with his horse near Bree when Gandalf found him on his way to\nthe village. Radagast warned Gandalf that the Nazgûl were abroad,\ndisguised as riders in black, and that they were seeking news of the\nShire. He also gave him Saruman's invitation and agreed to help Gandalf\nby getting beasts and birds to send news to Orthanc. With that he rode\naway back towards Mirkwood.\n\nBy sending Gandalf to Orthanc, Radagast unwittingly had him captured.\nSaruman's message proved to be a trap for Gandalf who was imprisoned in\nOrthanc, but still he did not believe that Radagast was also a part of\nSaruman's plans. Indeed, it was thanks to Radagast that Gandalf was able\nto escape from the pinnacle of Orthanc upon the wings of Gwaihir.\n\nRadagast's actions during and after the rest of the War are not\nrecorded. After the Council of Elrond, many scouts were sent out from\nRivendell to many different locations. Some passed over the Misty\nMountains and eventually came to Rhosgobel, but they found that Radagast\nwas not there.\n\nHis fate after the War of the Ring is not known.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis original, AIWENDIL, meant “bird-friend” in Quenya; IPA: ). It is\ncomprised of the Quenya _aiwë_ ( “bird”) and the ending _-ndil_\n(“friend”).\n\nAccording to the essay “The Istari” from the _Unfinished Tales_,\n_Radagast_ means “tender of beasts” in Adûnaic, the language of Númenor.\nHowever, in a later note Tolkien said that the name is in the language\nof the Men of the Vales of Anduin, and that its meaning is not\ninterpretable. The name _Radagast_ may actually be Anglo-Saxon, and\ncould have several interpretations, but, according to ''The Languages of\nMiddle-earth, ''this name is derived from a Slavic pagan god. The name\nRADEGAST was a name for one of West Slavic lesser gods. He is a god of\nthe Sun, war, fertility and harvest. He is also called Radigost,\nRadegast, Radhost, Radhošť, Redigast.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nTolkien's writing does not shed much light on Radagast's personality. In\nthe books, little is known about Radagast apart from certain defining\ncharacteristics. Saruman was the chief of the Order of Wizards and\nGandalf came next in the order; Radagast meanwhile held much less power\nand wisdom.\n\nAs one of the Maiar of Yavanna, Radagast had a great interest in the\nkelvar and olvar of Middle-earth and was a friend to beasts and\nbirds. Gandalf, however, held greater respect from, and\nknowledge about, birds than Radagast.\n\nRadagast displayed some qualities of innocence and naivety, making him\nan ideal accomplice of Saruman's plans, seen in providing his services\nto help the White examine the Gladden Fields. Saruman in turn\nconsidered him Simple(minded), a Fool and can be heard saying that he is\nacting in a manner contrary to how an Istari should be.\n\nIn the films he has a eccentric personality, but is also selfless and\nbrave, as shown when healing the hedgehog Sebastian, and in holding off\nan Orc pack so that Thorin & Company could go to Rivendell. He is also\nhighly intelligent, being a Wizard, and has an adept understanding on\nhow nature works, including performing healing spells and at magical\nblasts.\n\nDespite his somewhat childish ways, Radagast is also shown to be adept\nat combat, being able to hold his own against the resurrected Witch King\nof Angmar. He is also brave, and willing to help Gandalf any way he can,\nincluding rescuing him from Dol Guldur and even giving him his staff.\n\nRadagast's fidgety and slightly hyperactive speech pattern is somewhat\nof a trademark of actor Sylvester McCoy, who has a history of playing\neccentric and comedic characters.\n\n\nAbilities\n\nIn the books, during the Council of Elrond, Gandalf refers to Radagast\nas “_master of shapes and changes of hue_”, but the meaning of this is\nopen to question. He was wiser than any man in all things concerning\nherbs and animals. It is said that he spoke many languages of birds.\n\nIn the film, Radagast is portrayed as a strange, eccentric person who\ncan communicate with animals and shows a great knowledge of herbs and\nmedicines, including being able to restore a recently deceased hedgehog\nto life. He is also shown to possess formidable combat abilities, such\nas being able to ward off an attack by the Witch-king of Angmar (or his\nsummoned shade) while investigating Dol Guldur. His preferred form of\ntransportation is a sled made of sticks and pulled by “Rhosgobel\nRabbits”. The sled is fast enough to outrun a pack of Gundabad Wargs,\nwhich were ridden by Orcs under command of Yazneg in the film.\n\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nIt is not known when or if Radagast left Middle-earth. Tolkien writes\nthat he forsook his mission as one of the Wizards by becoming too\nobsessed with animals and plants, so presumably he failed, and might not\nbe allowed to return with honour. Tolkien also wrote that he did not\nbelieve that Radagast's failure was as great as Saruman's and that he\nmay eventually have been allowed (or chose) to return to the Undying\nLands. On the other hand, however, the primary mission of Radagast\nappointed by Yavanna may have actually been to watch over many of the\nflora and fauna of Middle-earth and to ensure their survival in the\nlikely case if Sauron conquered Middle-earth, and in this, he succeeded.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nFrom the first drafts of _The Hobbit_, Bladorthin identifies Radagast as\na fellow wizard and as his 'cousin'. John D. Rateliff notes that, at\nthis stage in the development of Tolkien's legendarium there was no\nreason why a wizard could not have a cousin. Rateliff also suggests that\nit is likely that Tolkien considered explaining Gandalf's absence\n(following the departure of Thorin and Company from Beorn's house) by\nsaying that he went to visit Radagast (who lived close by) to plan the\nattack on the Necromancer.\n\nEarly in the process of writing _The Lord of the Rings_, it is clear\nthat Tolkien envisaged some role for Radagast in the tale. He\neventually decided that he would use Radagast as the means of getting\nGandalf to Isengard.\n\nInitially Gandalf describes Radagast as his 'cousin', as he did in\n_The Hobbit_, but in a subsequent draft he becomes his 'kinsman'. In\nthe final version Gandalf merely says that Radagast is 'one of my\norder'.\n\nTolkien initially called him “Radagast the Grey”, but in pencil he\nchanged this to “Brown” and subsequently Saruman refers to him as\n“Radagast the Brown”.\n\nWhen Tolkien finished writing the story up till Moria, he made notes on\nthe future story development; therein he considered handing over\nIsengard to Radagast.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nBBC Radio's The Lord of the Ring (1981)\n\nDonald Gee provided the voice of Radagast. He is introduced much earlier\nthan in the book because his meeting with Gandalf is given\nchronologically.\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\n\n\nThe character Radagast and virtually all references to him (with the\nexception of the presence of being Eagles directed by an unseen force)\nwere not used in the film versions of _The Lord of the Rings_ directed\nby Peter Jackson. The character is also absent from the 1978 animated\nmovie of the same name.\n\nRadagast does appear in Peter Jackson's first _Hobbit_ film, although\nnone of the incidents involving Radagast in the movie were ever\nmentioned in any of Tolkien's writings; they are original to the movie.\nIn the book, Radagast is mentioned only once in passing, as Gandalf's\ncousin. In the movie, he is portrayed by actor Sylvester McCoy of\n_Doctor Who_ fame.\n\nRadagast is first mentioned in the film _The Hobbit: An Unexpected\nJourney_ when Bilbo Baggins enquirers of Gandalf whether there are any\nother wizards within Middle-earth. Gandalf responds that there are five\nwizards, of whom Radagast is one. Gandalf says that Radagast is a great\nwizard in his own particular way, enjoying the solitude of standing\nguard over the Greenwood forest and preferring the company of animals to\nthat of Men.\n\nRadagast is then seen investigating the Greenwood, noticing that much of\nthe vegetation is beginning to decay and much of the animal life is sick\nor dying. Radagast brings one of them, a hedgehog he calls Sebastian,\nback to his woodland house at Rhosgobel where he is able to nurse the\nhedgehog back to health. Radagast comes to the realisation that a type\nof powerful witchcraft has caused the decay of the Greenwood and its\ntransformation into what would now become known as Mirkwood. After\nRhosgobel is swarmed by Giant Spiders, Radagast investigates and\nidentifies the origin of the evil as the supposedly abandoned fortress\nof Dol Guldur.\n\nRadagast makes his way to Dol Guldur aboard a sled pulled by Rhosgobel\nrabbits. While Radagast is investigating Dol Guldur, he is attacked by\nthe spirit of the Witch-king of Angmar. Radagast is able to ward off his\nattacks and forces the Witch-King to drop his Morgul-blade and retreat.\nRadagast takes the Morgul-blade, but before he leaves he sees a shadowy\nfigure within the fortress, whom he believes to be the Necromancer.\n\nHe immediately goes on the search for Gandalf to inform him of the new\nfound threat within Mirkwood and is able to locate him within the\nTrollshaws accompanying Thorin and Company. Radagast tells Gandalf of\nthe threat the Necromancer is posing to Middle-Earth from within Dol\nGuldur and presents the Morgul-Blade as evidence. Shortly afterwards,\nthe company is attacked by a battalion of Warg Riders led by Yazneg.\nRadagast volunteers to create a diversion with his sled of Rhosgobel\nrabbits, drawing the Warg Riders away from Thorin and company, who are\nable to reach the safety of the Hidden Valley of Rivendell. Radagast's\nrabbit sled's superiority in speed and maneuverability allows him to\nescape the Warg Riders before they are driven off by elven horsemen led\nby Elrond.\n\nAt the White Council meeting in Rivendell, Gandalf backs Radagast's\nclaim that the Necromancer posed a serious threat to Middle-earth. But\nthe head of the White Council, the white wizard Saruman, remains\nskeptical and claims there is no evidence to support such a theory\ndespite Radagast's finding of the Morgul-blade. Saruman suggests that\nexcessive consumption of mushrooms has addled Radagast's judgement and\nreduced his reliability._The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_ (2012)\n\nIn _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_, Radagast (who was presumably\ninstructed by Galadriel) meets Gandalf inside the High Fells of Rhudaur\nand they find the tombs (or cells) of the Nazgûl broken into by 'dark\nspells'.\n\n\n\nRadagast became skeptical of Gandalf's beliefs that the Necromancer\nsummoned the Nazgûl to Dol Guldur, believing that no human sorcerer\ncould accomplish this. However, Gandalf reminded him that the Nazgûl\nonly answer to their one true master, Sauron, whom he suspects is the\ntrue identity of the Necromancer. Realizing that Sauron plans on\nattacking the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf attempts to leave to rejoin\nThorin and Company, but Radagast insists that they investigate Dol\nGuldur themselves. Upon arriving at the seemingly abandoned fortress,\nGandalf guessed that a spell of concealment had been erected over the\nplace, suspecting that their enemy has not regained his full strength.\nGandalf sends Radagast to take a message to Lady Galadriel while Gandalf\ncontinues his own investigation of the 'abandoned' fortress._The Hobbit:\nThe Desolation of Smaug_ (2013)\n\nIn The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, Radagast is seen chanting\nan incantation, seemingly a telepathic communication to support Gandalf\nas he attempts to break free from his cage. Later, he arrives at the\nBattle of Dol Guldur where he takes Gandalf to his sled, by the order of\nGaladriel. Radagast provides Gandalf a horse to ride to Erebor and his\nWizard Staff to replace his old one. Gandalf tells Radagast to summon\nevery bird and beast to join in the battle for the Lonely Mountain.\nRadagast leads a charge of the Great Eagles at the end of the battle to\nassist the Dwarves, Men, and Elves. He rides one of the eagles (possibly\nGwaihir) along with Beorn.\n\nVideo games\n\n\n\n-   Radagast also appears in the trading card game affiliated with\n    Jackson's _The Lord of the Rings_ trilogy.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Radagast appears in _The Lord of the Rings Online_, where he dwells\n    in the city of Ost Guruth. The player aids Radagast through a quest\n    series in the Lone-Lands, ending in a quest that sees Radagast and\n    the player battle the Gaunt-Lord Ivar. Radagast beats Ivar and\n    drives him away from the Lone-Lands. After Ivar is defeated,\n    Radagast relocates to the tower of Barad Dhorn in Agamaur.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Radagast appears in _The Lord of the Rings: War in the North_, where\n    he flees from his home in Rhosgobel during the War of the Ring to\n    one of his hideaways in Mirkwood. There Radagast is captured by the\n    spider Saenathra, at the behest of Agandaûr. Radagast is later freed\n    by Eradan, Farin and Andriel, who kill Saenathra. Radagast then\n    tells the trio of where to locate the dragon, Urgost, further\n    advancing their quest. He is voiced by Phil Proctor.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   He appears in the game _LEGO The Lord of the Rings_ as a playable\n    character and can be purchased near Bree, however he does tend to\n    wander and is not always in a set location. His equipment includes\n    only a staff which is unique to this character.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Radagast appears also in _LEGO The Hobbit: The Video Game_ as a\n    playable character.

    "text": "GANDALF (Norse; IPA: - “Elf of the Wand” or “Wand-elf”)_' the Grey_',\nlater known as GANDALF THE WHITE, and originally named OLÓRIN (Quenya;\nIPA: - “Dreamer” or “Of Dreams”), was an _Istar_ (wizard), sent by the\nWest in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined Thorin\nand his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, convoked the\nFellowship of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples\nin the final campaign of the War of the Ring.\n\n\nBiography\n\nYears of the Lamps\n\n\n\nOriginally called OLÓRIN, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar\n(with the possible exception of Melian). He was a Maia of Manwë and\nVarda. He also served under two other Valar, such as Irmo and Nienna.\nWhen the Valar decided to send the order of the Istari (also known as\nWizards) to Middle-earth, to counsel and assist all those in\nMiddle-earth who opposed the Dark Lord Sauron, Manwë and Varda decided\nto include Olórin among the five who were sent.\n\nAt first, Olórin was nervous and described himself as too weak and too\nafraid of Sauron. Manwë understood, and told him that that was one main\nreason why he should go, to overcome that fear. Thus, he insisted that\nOlórin should go as the third, but Varda convinced him not to include\nOlórin as the third, but as the second. Olórin agreed, and prepared\nfor his departure from the Undying Lands with the other four wizards.\n\nThird Age\n\nArrival in Middle-earth\n\nWhen he arrived to Middle-earth, he received Narya, the ring of fire,\nfrom Círdan the Shipwright. Olórin, renamed _GANDALF_, spent many\ncenturies walking among the Elves as a stranger, learning from them and\nteaching them. He later revealed himself as one of the Istari, and\neventually became known as the wisest of and most powerful of that\norder. He joined the White Council, which was formed to investigate a\ndark power in Dol Guldur, of which Galadriel wanted him to become the\nleader, yet Saruman came to lead the Council instead of him. Although\nSaruman was initially more powerful, was more knowledgeable about many\nmatters regarding Sauron and the Rings of Power, and was head of the\nWhite Council before the War of the Ring, he later grew jealous and\nafraid of Gandalf, which was the reason of his betrayal.\n\nQuest to Erebor\n\n\n\nGandalf wandered for many years amongst the Free People of Middle-earth,\nbut spent most of that time amongst the Elves, where he learned much and\ntaught much. He also continued to gather such information about Sauron\nand his ilk as he could, and to that end, he began to suspect that the\nNecromancer of Dol Guldur was in fact Sauron taking shape once again. He\nentered Dol Guldur, but Sauron, still greatly weakened, fled from him\nand for a short time, the evil of Mirkwood was greatly reduced. However,\nSauron quickly returned to Dol Guldur, and by 2850 of the Third Age, had\nrebuilt his forces there. In that year, Gandalf again entered the\nfortress and encountered Thráin II, father of Thorin Oakenshield, who\nwas dying after having been horribly tormented. Before his death, the\nold Dwarf king entrusted Gandalf with a map and key to the Lonely\nMountain.\n\nIn the year 2941, Gandalf became troubled by his knowledge of Sauron's\nresurgent strength. He knew that Sauron was already plotting war from\nDol Guldur, and that as soon as he felt strong enough, he would attack\nRivendell. Unfortunately, the only power left besides Rivendell to\nresist an attempt from Mirkwood to regain the lands of Angmar was the\nDwarves of the Iron Hills. Even worse, Gandalf knew that Smaug to Golden\nresided still in the Lonely Mountain, and that Sauron could and would\nuse the dragon to devastating effect once he became strong enough to\ninfluence Smaug. However, Saruman seemed reluctant to engage Sauron's\nforces, though none of the White Council realized that he was already a\ntraitor.\n\nOne night, while pondering the problem of the Free People's weakness in\nthe North, Gandalf had a chance encounter in Bree with the Dwarf Thorin\nII Oakenshield, who was also searching, without direction or much hope,\nfor a way to reclaim the Kingdom Under the Mountain. Gandalf and Thorin\nthen concocted a plan (more Gandalf's than Thorin's) to potentially draw\nthe dragon out of the mountain and reclaim the kingdom. To that end,\nGandalf visited Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit of the Shire, to convince him to\ngo with Thorin and Company to Erebor and aid them. At the time, Bilbo\nthought of him as little more than a vain, a fussy old conjurer who\nentertained children with fireworks during festivals and parties, but\nsoon discovered his true nature. It is on this quest that Gandalf\nfinds his sword, Glamdring, and that Bilbo finds his sword, Sting,\nand the One Ring (though at the time it is mistaken for a lesser\nring).\n\nGandalf himself joined the quest both in order to see what he could do\nto destroy the dragon, and to try to convince the White Council\n(particularly Saruman) to oust Sauron from Dol Guldur. During the\nDwarves' quest, Gandalf vanished twice— once to scout their path, the\nsecond time to “attend to other pressing business”, the nature of\nwhich he refused to discuss. He was actually attending a meeting of the\nWhite Council. When Bilbo found the One Ring, Gandalf was immediately\nsuspicious of the Hobbit's story of how he acquired it. He privately\nconfronted Bilbo and forced the truth out of him, and is deeply troubled\nby his story of the Ring's powers as they seem eerily familiar. Perhaps\neven more troubling to him is that Bilbo, a proper, honorable hobbit,\nwould uncharacteristically lie about his story.\n\n Gandalf abandoned\nThorin's company when they reached Mirkwood to participate in the White\nCouncil's assault on Dol Guldur. The attack appeared to drive out The\nNecromancer (Sauron), though he immediately retreated to his\nlong-prepared stronghold of Barad-dûr. Gandalf rejoined Thorin's company\nat the very moment the Battle of Five Armies breaks out, bearing news of\nthe arrival of a goblin and warg army. Gandalf fought in the battle, and\nhelped destroy the goblin threat. Thorin himself was slain during the\nbattle, but Gandalf's primary aim was achieved; with the destruction of\nSmaug and the ousting of the goblin army, Dáin II Ironfoot became King\nunder the Mountain and restored the Lonely Mountain to a powerful\nkingdom. This, along with the strengthening of the Kingdom of Dale,\nallowed the Free People of the Northern region of Middle-earth to have\nconsiderable preparation against Sauron's forces during the later War of\nthe Ring, where before they had virtually none. Following the battle,\nGandalf accompanied Bilbo back to the Shire.\n\nBefore the War\n\nReturn to the Shire\n\nGandalf spent the years between TA 2941 to TA 3001 travelling\nMiddle-earth in search of information on Sauron's resurgence and Bilbo's\nmysterious ring. He spent as much time as he could in the Shire,\nhowever, strengthening his friendship with Bilbo and befriending Bilbo's\nnephew, Frodo, while simultaneously becoming suspicious of Saruman and\nhis allegiances.\n\n\n\nIn TA 3001, around the time of Bilbo's “Eleventy-First” (111th) birthday\nparty, Gandalf returned to the Shire, bringing along many fireworks for\nthe occasion. After seeing Frodo and visiting Bilbo again, Gandalf\nattended the party.\n\nDuring Bilbo's speech, he put on a mysterious ring and disappeared, as a\njoke on his neighbours. Later as he was bidding farewell to Gandalf, who\nhad known about his plans to leave, Bilbo began to change his mind about\nleaving his ring to Frodo, as he had earlier agreed. When Gandalf tried\nto persuade him to leave it, Bilbo became hostile and accused Gandalf of\ntrying to steal the ring for his own benefit, which he referred to as\nhis “precious.” Horrified by Bilbo's outburst, Gandalf stood to his full\nheight and appeared menacing, frightening the hobbit. This brought Bilbo\nback to his senses; he apologised, admitted that the Ring had been\ntroubling him lately, and left the ring behind. Bilbo and Gandalf bid\neach other goodbye, before Bilbo left the Shire for his journey.\n\n\n\nGandalf, troubled by this, mulled over Bilbo's agressive behaviour.\nBefore finally leaving the Shire, Gandalf gave the ring to Frodo,\nadvising him to keep it safe. Over the next seventeen years, Gandalf\ntraveled extensively, searching for answers. Having long sought for\nGollum near Mordor, he met Aragorn, who had captured the creature in\nMirkwood.\n\nGandalf interrogated Gollum and learned that Sauron had forced Gollum to\ntell what he knew about the ring under torture. Gandalf left Mirkwood\nsoon after, and left Gollum with the Wood-elves of Northern Mirkwood.\n\nSaruman's betrayal\n\n\n\nUpon returning to the Shire, Gandalf immediately went to Frodo and\nconfirmed his suspicions by throwing the Ring into Frodo's hearth fire,\nwhich revealed, in Black Speech, the inscription upon the ring. Gandalf\nthen told a dumbfounded Frodo about the One Ring and its history, and\nhow Sauron would seek to regain it. Instructing Frodo to go to Rivendell\nwith the ring, Gandalf told him to make arrangements to leave the Shire\nquietly.\n\nRiding near the Shire, Gandalf encountered Radagast the Brown, another\nWizard, referred to as “his cousin”, who asked him to seek out\nSaruman the White, as the Nazgûl had come forth and crossed the River\nAnduin. Before he left, Gandalf instructed Radagast to alert all the\n'birds and beasts' that were friendly to the latter to convey messages\nabout the Nazgûl to Saruman and Gandalf at Orthanc.\n\n\n\nLeaving a note for Frodo with Barliman Butterbur, an inn-keeper in Bree,\nGandalf left for Isengard to speak with Saruman. Once there, however,\nGandalf discovered that Saruman wanted the One Ring to himself and\ndeclared himself Saruman of Many Colours. He tried to convince Gandalf\nto either join with him in service to Sauron, so that they could\neventually control the Dark Lord and thus achieve good ends, though\nthrough evil means, or to help him find the One Ring so they could take\npower from Sauron. Gandalf refused, and was held prisoner at the top of\nthe tower Orthanc.\n\nJourney to Rivendell\n\n\n\nAfter spending a while as Saruman's prisoner, Gandalf was eventually\nrescued by Gwaihir the Eagle. Gwaihir's real purpose for visiting\nOrthanc was to report a sighting of the Nazgûl, as Radagast had appealed\nto him to do so earlier on. The great Eagle set Gandalf down in Rohan,\nwhere he appealed to King Théoden for a horse.\n\nKing Théoden allowed Gandalf to take any horse he desired, but only to\ndo so quickly. There, Gandalf chose the horse Shadowfax. Riding for the\nShire, Gandalf arrived too late for Frodo; he had already set out.\n\nKnowing that Frodo would be heading for Rivendell, Gandalf began to make\nhis own way there. Shortly after arriving in Bree, Gandalf learned that\nthe Hobbits had already began travelling to Rivendell with his ally and\nold friend: Aragorn. Subsequently, Gandalf was confronted one night\nby Sauron's Nazgûl at Weathertop. After an all-night battle with the\nRingwraiths, Gandalf was able to eventually escape, though four of the\nnine Nazgûl pursued him.\n\nSeveral days later, Frodo, Aragorn, and company stayed at Weathertop and\nwere confronted by the remaining five Nazgûl. Despite their escape,\nFrodo was stabbed in the process by the Ringwraith leader, who used a\nMorgul-blade. Gandalf was able to evade the four Nazgûl and\nsuccessfully reach Rivendell. However, several days later, an injured\nFrodo arrived at the Ford of Bruinen, though the Nazgûl pursued him all\nthe way there. Gandalf, along with Elrond, saved Frodo from the Nazgûl\nby enchanting the water and sweeping them away.\n\nForming of the Fellowship\n\n At Rivendell, Gandalf, along with Frodo, Bilbo, and\nmany others, attended the secret Council of Elrond. There Gandalf\nexplained to the others how Saruman had imprisoned him and how the White\nWizard was creating his own army of orcs to rival Sauron's.\n\nAs everyone at the Council debated over the ring, Frodo offered to be\nthe ring-bearer and take it to Mount Doom to be destroyed. Gandalf\nvolunteered to help and protect Frodo on his quest, along with Aragorn,\nBoromir, Legolas, and Gimli. Sam snuck in and was allowed to go because\nof this.\n\n\n\nWith this the Fellowship of the Ring was formed. Gandalf later convinced\nElrond to allow Frodo's cousins, Merry and Pippin, to join the\nFellowship. Subsequently, after preparing for the journey, the\nFellowship left Rivendell. Gandalf took leadership of the Fellowship,\nleading the group south after leaving Rivendell. He and Aragorn led the\nhobbits and their companions on an unsuccessful effort to cross Mount\nCaradhras.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nMines of Moria\n\nThey then took the “dark and secret way” through the Mines of Moria,\nmuch to Aragorn's discomfort; though he had passed through the Mines\nonce before, he had no desire to go through them again, and he feared\nfor Gandalf if they did so. As they tried to leave the mines, at the\nBridge of Khazad-dûm, Gandalf faced a Balrog, known commonly as Durin's\nBane. It was one of the Maiar corrupted by Melkor in the early days\nof Arda.\n\n Gandalf stopped on the Bridge,\nstanding in the middle of the span, allowing the others to escape. He\nleaned on the staff in his left hand and held the sword Glamdring,\ngleaming cold and white, in his right. The Balrog stepped onto the\nBridge, facing Gandalf, and the shadow about it reached out like two\nvast wings. It raised its whip, and the thongs whined and cracked. Fire\ncame from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm and declared that the\nBalrog could not pass. They clashed, and the Balrog's sword was\nshattered. Then the Balrog leaped full upon the Bridge, and Gandalf\nlifted his staff and smote the span. His staff broke, but the Bridge\ncracked at the Balrog's feet. The stone beneath the Balrog broke and\nfell, taking the Balrog with it into the abyss, but the thongs of its\nwhip snared Gandalf about his knees, and Wizard and Balrog plummeted\ntogether into the darkness below. Galdalf cried, “Fly, you fools!” and\nwas gone.\n\n Gandalf and the Balrog fell for a long\ntime, and Gandalf was burned by the Balrog's fire. Then they plunged\ninto a deep lake in the depths of the mountain, which Gandalf later said\nwas cold as the tide of death and almost froze his heart. They fought in\nthe water until finally the Balrog fled into dark tunnels, where the\nworld is gnawed by nameless things, older even than Sauron. Gandalf\npursued the creature until it led him to the spiraling Endless Stair,\nand they climbed it until they reached Durin's Tower in the living rock\nof Zirakzigil, the pinnacle of the Silvertine above the clouds. There\nthey fought, until at last Gandalf threw down his enemy, and the Balrog\nbroke the mountain-side as it fell. Then darkness took Gandalf, and he\npassed away. His body lay on the peak. The entire battle, from the\nconfrontation on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm to the mutual demise of the\nBalrog and Gandalf, had taken ten days.\n\nTwenty days later Gandalf returned to life, and lay in a trance.\n\n\n\nThree days later he was found by the windlord Gwaihir, the Lord of the\nEagles, who had been sent by Galadriel to find him. Gandalf was carried\nto Caras Galadhon in Lothlórien, where he was healed, and clothed in\nwhite, and thus became Gandalf the White.\n\nIn Fangorn forest he encountered Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas while they\nwere tracking Pippin and Merry, who had been captured by orcs in\nGandalf's absence.\n\nRohan\n\nRevealing himself to the three, he explained how he had survived and\nreturned. There, Gandalf tried to persuade Aragorn to go to Rohan\ninstead, insisting there are other pressing matters, such as the War\ncoming to Rohan and the impending attack on Edoras by Saruman.\n\n\n\nArriving in Rohan with Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas, Gandalf discovered\nKing Théoden, weakened by Saruman's agent, Grima Wormtongue. However,\nGandalf quickly broke Wormtongue and Saruman's hold over Théoden.\n\nWhile Théoden and the Rohirrim rode to Helm's Deep to do battle with the\nhordes of Isengard, Gandalf rode to Orthanc and asked Treebeard to\nencourage the Huorns to Assist him in defeating Saruman and his\nUruk-hai. He also rode to find Erkenbrand and his men and persuaded them\nto ride to Helm's Deep.\n\nSiege of Gondor\n\nAfter overthrowing Saruman, Gandalf broke his rival's staff and banished\nhim from the Order of Wizards. Then, against his counsel, Pippin glanced\ninto the Palantír of Orthanc that he recovered from Saruman and made\ncontact with Sauron. He then took Pippin with him to Gondor to aid in\nthe defense of the city. Along the way, Gandalf gave Pippin a brief\nhistory of Palantír, mentioning Feanor, and how it was fortunate that\nPippin made contact with Sauron instead of himself, since he was not yet\nready for a meeting with Sauron. Arriving at Minas Tirith, he met with\nDenethor II and tried to give him counsel.\n\n After Faramir's charge, the\nMorgul host assaulted the city. Gandalf provided valuable aid to the\nWhite City and bought precious time allowing the Rohirrim to save Gondor\nduring The Battle of the Pelennor Fields. When the battering ram Grond\nbreached the gates of the city, numerous trolls rushed through,\nattacking the defenders. However, Gandalf rode in and helped kill a few.\nGandalf alone stood in defiance of the Witch-King, however Gandalf's\npower was never tested. With the timely arrival of Rohan, the Witch-king\nleft to deal with the new threat. With the arrival of Rohan, and the\npleas of Pippin concerning Denethor's intention to kill Faramir and\nhimself, Gandalf rushed to Faramir's aid. Gandalf took Faramir from the\npyre and tried to deter Denethor from suicide. However, driven mad by\nhis grief and Sauron's messages via the Palantír of Minas Tirith,\nDenethor set the pyre aflame while looking into said Palantír. In grief,\nGandalf closed the doors of the chamber. Denethor later gave out a cry\nand said no more. Soon afterward, Gandalf delegated the control of the\ncity to the Prince of Dol Amroth.\n\nThe Fall of Sauron\n\n\nGandalf, alongside Aragorn, led the final battle against Sauron's forces\nat the Black Gate, waging an all-out battle to distract the Dark Lord's\nattention away from Frodo and Sam, who were at the very same moment\nscaling Mount Doom to destroy the Ring. Though the forces of good\nwere heavily outnumbered, they were able to hold back the enemy until\nthe hobbits reached the peak of Mount Doom.\n\nOn the precipice within, looking over the fires of Mount Doom, Frodo\nfinally succumbed the power of the Ring, slipping it onto his finger.\nHowever, Gollum, unable to bear the thought that the Ring would be\ndestroyed, lunged at Frodo, biting off his ring finger, and the Ring, in\nthe process. Gollum and the Ring fell into the fire, and the Ring was\nfinally destroyed. Without Gandalf's efforts, Sauron might have learned\nwhere the two hobbits were and killed them before they could have\ncompleted their task.\n\nFourth Age\n\nFour years after the ring was destroyed, Gandalf spent some time with\nthe “moss gatherer” Tom Bombadil, then, after having spent over 2,000\nyears in Middle-earth, departed with Frodo, Galadriel, Celeborn, Bilbo,\nElrond, (and presumably Shadowfax) across the sea to the Undying Lands,\nand was never seen again in Middle-earth. \n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Gandalf_ means “Elf of the wand” or “Wand-elf”, from old\nnorthern Mannish.\n\nWithin the Tolkien Legendarium, “Gandalf” translates an unknown name of\nthe meaning “Wand-Elf” (alternatively cane/staff) in old northern\nMannish. Most denizens of Middle-earth incorrectly assumed Gandalf was a\nMan (human), although he was really a Maia spirit (approximately\nequivalent to an angel). However, a less common misconception that\noccurred during the beginning of his career in Middle-earth was that for\nsomeone to be immortal and use as much magic as he did, he must have\nbeen an elf, although it soon became apparent to all that he couldn't be\nan elf, as he was old and elves don't generally age. Even because of\nthis, the nickname stuck with him. He later gave it as his name to\nothers he met who didn't know its original meaning.\n\nOther names\n\n-   OLÓRIN, his name in Valinor and in very ancient times. It comes from\n    the Quenya _olor_ or _olos_ (“dream”). The name could also be\n    spelled as _Olorion_.\n-   MITHRANDIR, his Sindarin name, used in Gondor and by the Elves. It\n    means “Grey Pilgrim”, from the Sindarin _mith_ (“grey”) and _ran_\n    (“wander”) or _rhandir_ (“pilgrim”).\n-   THARKÛN, given by the Dwarves), which means “Staff man”.\n-   INCÁNUS, a name of unclear language and meaning. He must have\n    acquired the name from one of his many travels in the south, near\n    Harad. Tolkien several times changed his mind about it, varying\n    between the Latin word _incanus_ (meaning Grey and a possible\n    Westron invention meaning “Greymantle”), a word _Ind-cano_ (meaning\n    Cruel Ruler), or even a form of Southron meaning “Spy of the North”.\n-   OLD GREYBEARD, by the Mouth of Sauron when they meet at the\n    Morannon.\n-   THE WHITE RIDER (when mounted on the great horse Shadowfax)\n-   STORMCROW (a reference to his arrival being associated with times of\n    trouble), often used by his detractors to mean he is a troublesome\n    meddler in the affairs of others.\n-   LATHSPELL, by Grima Wormtongue\n-   GANDALF GREYHAME\n-   THE GREY PILGRIM\n-   GANDALF THE GREY, and later GANDALF THE WHITE after he was reborn as\n    the successor to Saruman.\n-   GANDALF THE WANDERING WIZARD\n\n\nCharacter Development\n\nMythical roots\n\nThe Old Norse name “_Gandalfr_” appears in the list of dwarves in the\n_Völuspá_ of the Elder Edda; the name means “cane-elf,” or “wand-elf.”\nTolkien took the name along with the dwarves names when he wrote _The\nHobbit_ in the 1930s. He came to regret the creation of this _“rabble of\neddaic-named dwarves,  invented in an idle hour”_ (The Return of\nthe Shadow:452), since it forced him to come up with an explanation of\nwhy Old Norse names should be used in Third Age of Middle-earth. He\nsolved the dilemma in 1942 by the explanation that Old Norse was a\n_translation_ of the language of Dale. The figure of Gandalf has other\ninfluences from Germanic mythology, particularly Odin in his incarnation\nas “the Wanderer”, an old man with one eye, a long white beard, a wide\nbrimmed hat, and a staff. Tolkien states that he thinks of Gandalf as an\n_“Odinic wanderer”_ in a letter of 1946. Gandalf is also similar to\nVäinämöinen, a Bard in Finnish mythology.\n\nDer Berggeist\n\n\n\nTolkien had a postcard labelled _Der Berggeist_ (“the mountain spirit”),\nand on the paper cover in which he kept it, he wrote “origin of Gandalf”\nat some point. The postcard reproduces a painting of a bearded figure,\nsitting on a rock under a pine tree in a mountainous setting. He wears a\nwide-brimmed round hat, and a long cloak and a white fawn is nuzzling\nhis upturned hands.\n\nHumphrey Carpenter in his 1977 biography said that Tolkien had bought\nthe postcard during his 1911 holiday in Switzerland. However, Manfred\nZimmerman (1983) discovered that the painting was by German artist Josef\nMadlener and dates to the late 1920s. Humphrey Carpenter concluded that\nTolkien was probably mistaken about the origin of the postcard himself.\nTolkien must have acquired the card at some time in the early 1930s, at\na time when _The Hobbit_ had already begun to take shape.\n\nThe original painting was auctioned at Sotheby's in London on July 12,\n2005 for 84,000. The previous owner had been given the painting by\nMadlener in the 1940s and recalled that he had stated the mountains in\nthe background of the painting were the Dolomites.\n\n\nAppearance\n\nGandalf is described as an old man with a pointed blue hat, a long grey\ncloak, and a silver scarf. He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows\nthat stuck out beyond the brim of the hat.\n\nAfter he is resurrected, the change of his signature colour from grey to\nwhite is significant, for he was sent back to replace the corrupted head\nof the Order of Wizards and leader of the White Council Saruman as the\nChief of the Order of Wizards. In the book, he says that he has himself\nbecome what Saruman should have been.\n\nCírdan the Shipwright seemed to have foreseen this, for he entrusted the\ncare of Narya, the Ring of Fire (one of the Three Rings of the Elves) to\nGandalf rather than Saruman.\n\n\nPowers and abilities\n\nGandalf the Grey displays the widest range of powers, though all other\nforms have at least this many. Though strangely, as this is more\nbefitting a Maiar of Aule, his powers are very much linked to fire. Here\nis a list of a few of the times he used fire\n\n• Heating fire\n\n• Manipulating sparks\n\n• Creating massive pillars of smoke.\n\n• Lighting a log on fire while soaking wet\n\nGandalf also created bright white light during the Fellowship's\nexpedition into Moria. He later displays the ability to focus this light\ninto a beam.\n\nGandalf also displays the ability to use Words of Command. However, he\nonly displayed this power once, when he used it to shut a door.\n\nGandalf the White displays these same powers but more advanced.\n\nHe also displayed the ability to communicate with animals, specifically\nShadowfax.\n\nFinally, he also shattered Saruman’s staff, and stripped him of his\ndivine power.\n\nAs his unrestricted form, Olorin, he had all his previous powers\nmassively boosted, and the ability to shapeshift.\n\nHowever, even this form seems to have restrictions, as the Ainur were\nsaid to have their power restricted upon descending to earth. If so his\ntrue form would be enormously beyond his other forms, possibly capable\nof destroying entire universes.\n\n\nWeapons\n\nGandalf primarily used his staff, but also carried a sword in combat.\nSometimes during combat, Gandalf would be seen wielding both weapons\nagainst his enemies.\n\nStaff\n\nGandalf utilised his staff for various spells and abilities. He didn't\nuse it just as a weapon; he also utilized a staff as if it were a\nwalking stick. He initially had an old wooden staff which he lost in the\nMines of Moria while fighting the Balrog. He used a new one upon\nbecoming Gandalf the White.\n\nGlamdring\n\nThis was an Elven sword Gandalf found in a troll cave. From that point\nuntil the resolution of the War of the Ring, he used this as a weapon to\ncomplement his staff, wielding them with equal skill. In many cases, he\nfought with both weapons at once.\n\n\nAppearances in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Hobbit_\n-   _The Lord of the Rings_\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Silmarillion_\n-   _Unfinished Tales_\n-   _The History of Middle-earth_\n\nIn the films\n\n-   _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_\n-   _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_\n-   _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nHobbit and Lord of the Rings film trilogies\n\nSir Ian McKellen portrayed Gandalf in the _The Lord of the Rings _film\ntrilogy directed by Peter Jackson.\n\nSean Connery was originally considered for the role of Gandalf, but\nturned it down because he didn't want to spend so long in New Zealand,\nwhere the film was shot; Tom Baker of _Doctor Who_ fame, Patrick\nStewart, Christopher Plummer, and David Bowie were also considered or\napproached. McKellen's interpretation of the role was widely\npraised. He was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of\nGandalf in _The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring_, making\nhim the only individual cast member to be nominated for his performance.\nChristopher Lee, a lifelong fan of the books, had hoped to be cast as\nGandalf, but due to his advancing age, he instead opted for the role of\nSaruman, as Gandalf required more horse riding and more sword work.\n\nIan McKellen reprised his role of Gandalf the Grey for the three-part\nadaptation of _The Hobbit_, noting in early interviews that he preferred\nportraying Gandalf the Grey to Gandalf the White, as Gandalf the Grey\nrequired a more nuanced performance. He maintains, however, that he\nenjoyed playing both Gandalf's, but felt Gandalf the Grey was easier and\ncalmer to portray."

    "text": "SARUMAN (Quenya; IPA:  - “Man Of Skill”), also known as\nSARUMAN THE WHITE was an _Istar_ (wizard), who lived in Middle-earth\nduring the Third Age. Originally, he was the chief of the wizards and of\nthe White Council that opposed Sauron. His extensive studies of dark\nmagic, however, eventually led him to desire the One Ring for himself.\nThinking he could ally himself with Sauron and then betray him, Saruman\nallied Isengard with Mordor in the War of the Ring, in which he was\ndefeated.\n\nHe studied deeply the arts of Sauron, the better to oppose him, but he\nsoon became enamored of Sauron's devices, especially the One Ring. He\nbetrayed his mission and sought the power of the Ring for himself. He\ninitially advocated an alliance with Sauron, but he soon betrayed Sauron\nas well, as his ultimate goal was to supplant Sauron and rule\nMiddle-earth. But his plans came to nought, and his power was broken in\nthe Battle of the Hornburg and the Battle of Isengard.\n\nBefore his fall, he was the chief of both the wizards and of the White\nCouncil (a league of all those opposed to Sauron). His knowledge and\nskill, especially of Sauron's devices, was said to be great. However,\nhis deep study of the One Ring and Sauron's other magic corrupted him,\nand his overweening lust for power led to his downfall. He is one of the\nfew characters in Middle-earth who is morally “grey” - serving neither\ngood nor evil. He betrays both sides and ultimately works for his own\nends.\n\n\nBiography\n\nYears of the Lamps\n\n Saruman was\noriginally a Maia of Aulë the Smith - just as Sauron had once been -\nnamed CURUMO, meaning “skillful one”, or CURUNÍR by the elves in\nSindarin. In Valinor, the land of the Valar, a council was called by\nManwë, leader of the Valar, shortly after Sauron's defeat by the Last\nAlliance of Elves and Men. Though Sauron was overthrown, it would later\nturn out that he had not been effectively vanquished and his shadow\nbegan to fall upon Middle-earth a second time. It was decided to send\nfive emissaries to Middle-earth. These should be “mighty, peers of\nSauron, yet forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh,” as they were\nintended to help Men and Elves unite against Sauron, but the wizards\nwere forbidden from matching the Dark Lord in power and fear.\n\nThe other four who were chosen were Olórin (Gandalf), Aiwendil\n(Radagast), and Alatar and Pallando (the Blue Wizards). Curumo was\nappointed overall leader of the group. {{-}}\n\nArrival in Middle-earth\n\nThe five wizards arrived at the Grey Havens in the west of Eriador\naround the year 1000. Only the keeper of the havens, Círdan the\nShipwright, knew Saruman's identity and origin. Saruman would later\ndiscover that Círdan had given Narya, the Red Ring, to Gandalf upon\ntheir first landing in Middle-earth. Even though Saruman was immediately\nconsidered the head of the order while Gandalf was not, Círdan had\ndivined Gandalf as the wisest and greatest of the wizards. Saruman's\njealousy of Gandalf grew from these events, perhaps because he feared\nthat he would eventually supplant him as chief of wizards.\n\nSaruman and the two Blue Wizards went into the east of Middle-earth.\nAfter one and a half millennia, he returned to the west, just as\nSauron's power was growing again in Dol Guldur.\n\nThe White Council\n\nWhen the White Council was formed at approximately year 2463 of the\nThird Age in order to counter Sauron, Saruman was appointed its leader,\nthough Galadriel wanted Gandalf in this position. Saruman refused to\nstep down due to his pride, while Gandalf had declined. At this point\nSaruman had begun to sense the resurgence of Sauron and to envy and\ndesire his power, and especially the One Ring. This was also the same\nyear that the One Ring was taken by the Halfling Sméagol (later called\nGollum), who disappeared with it into the Misty Mountains for hundreds\nof years. It was during the meetings of the Council that Saruman first\nnoted Gandalf's interest in Hobbits and The Shire, and believing that\nall his deeds related to some as yet undisclosed plan of his for\nself-enhancement, Saruman himself began keeping a greater watch on\nGandalf and sent spies to The Shire. At first, he himself visited it\nsecretly but stopped when he realized that its inhabitants had noticed\nhim. Amongst the purposes of his visits was to procure some of the\nhalflings' Pipe-weed, since in secret imitation of Gandalf he had begun\nto smoke.\n\nAt Isengard\n\n\n\nIn the year TA 2759, Saruman settled in Isengard with the permission of\nthe Steward of Gondor, Beren, although he settled only as Warden of the\nTower and representative of the Steward (the stronghold had by then been\nabandoned by Gondor). There he became important in the informal alliance\ndefending the west of Middle-earth. In the tower of Isengard, Orthanc,\nhe also found one of the remaining Palantíri.\n\nIn TA 2850, Gandalf entered Dol Guldur and confirmed that the evil\npresence was indeed Sauron. By Saruman's advice, the White Council\ndecided against attacking Dol Guldur. Gandalf would later remark that it\nwas at this council meeting that he first began to suspect that Saruman\ndesired to possess the One Ring. Saruman's real intention was to permit\nSauron to build up his strength, so that the One Ring would reveal\nitself. He later found that Sauron had more knowledge of the possible\nlocation of the One Ring than he expected, and in TA 2941, he finally\nagreed to attack Dol Guldur.\n\nTen years after, Sauron abandoned Dol Guldur he returned to Mordor and\ndeclared himself openly. He established contact with Saruman through the\nPalantír captured from Minas Ithil, now Minas Morgul. In this year,\nSaruman also took Isengard for his own and began to fortify it.\n\nWhen Gandalf presented Saruman with the discovery and the location of\nthe One Ring, Saruman revealed his desire for it and his secret alliance\nwith Sauron. He had also shed the title of Saruman the White; Saruman no\nlonger had any loyalty to the White Council, or the Ring-bearer. He\ntried unsuccessfully to gain Gandalf's allegiance. When Gandalf refused\nto join with him, Saruman held him captive in Isengard. Gandalf later\nescaped with help from Gwaihir the Windlord, one of Middle-earth's large\nEagles, and made Saruman's treachery known to the rest of the White\nCouncil.\n\nThe Beginning of the End\n\n\n\nBy one account, the Nazgûl came two days after Gandalf's escape and\nSaruman used his Voice to persuade the Lord of the Nazgûl that he did\nnot know the Ring's location but that Gandalf did and they should seek\nhim nearby. After the Nazgûl heard this they went back on the main road\nrode along and instead found Gríma Wormtongue (who went to tell Saruman\nthat Gandalf had been to Edoras) who revealed that Saruman was hiding\nhis knowledge of the Shire from them. By another account, Saruman only\ndiscovered that Gandalf had escaped when the Nazgûl arrived, he has\nbeen, according to this account, about to beg Gandalf for forgiveness\nand help, only to find him gone. He pretended that Gandalf was still\nthere and had just told him the location of the Shire.\n\nThe Nazgûl later learned that Saruman knew far more than he had\nrevealed. On their way to the Shire, the Nazgûl met one of Saruman's\nShire spies, from whom they got detailed maps of the Shire made by\nSaruman. They sent the spy back to the Shire after warning him that he\nwas now in the service of Mordor (the Orc-like man in the Inn of the\nPrancing Pony).\n\nBelieving that he would find no pity from either quarter (a false\nassumption, since he was later offered pardon by Gandalf); Saruman now\nput all efforts into obtaining the One Ring for himself. Not all of\nthese efforts ever became known, but they included sending spies to\nwaylay Frodo Baggins on his flight from the Shire (Bill Ferny in Bree),\nattacking Rohan outright with Uruk-hai, and dispatching raiding parties\nof Uruk-hai accompanied by Moria Orcs on likely routes the Fellowship of\nthe Ring might take through Rohan to go towards Gondor. One of those\nparties captured Pippin and Merry and shot Boromir “with many\nblack-feathered arrows” when he tried to defend the Hobbits. This led\nAragorn, Legolas, and Gimli on a search which eventually led to the\nBattle of Helms Deep as well as the Destruction of Isengard by the Ents\nunder Treebeard, leading to the end of Saruman's reign of power in the\nnorth.\n\nPower Destroyed\n\n\n\nSaruman's plans failed, and he suffered a series of setbacks. Saruman's\nShire network did not capture Frodo Baggins, and Éomer destroyed his\nonly partially successful raiding party. His invasion of Rohan ended in\ndisaster with the utter defeat of his army at the Battle of the\nHornburg. Leaving Isengard undefended resulted in its destruction at the\nhands of the Ents (Saruman had underestimated the Ents' anger and\nstrength).\n\nConfined to the Orthanc and with his servants scattered or killed,\nSaruman made one final unsuccessful attempt to turn Théoden and Gandalf\nover to evil. The latter then offered Saruman a chance for redemption,\nwhich involved surrendering his staff and the Keys of Orthanc as a\npledge. Saruman had a moment of doubt but in the end pride, anger, and\nhate won over and he refused the chance of redemption.\n\n\n\nGandalf, who had returned from death to supplant Saruman, as the White\nand the head of the Wizard, expelled Saruman from the order and broke\nhis staff. Saruman also lost the Palantír of Orthanc when Gríma\nWormtongue threw it off a balcony of Orthanc, undecided about which he\nhated more, Saruman or Gandalf, and hitting neither.\n\n\nFinal Fall\n\nLeft out of the final stages of the War of the Ring, Saruman eventually\nmanaged to persuade the Ents who kept him captive into letting him leave\nIsengard after he met the conditions of handing over the Keys of\nOrthanc. He then went to the Shire, which his agent Lotho\nSackville-Baggins had brought under control. He spent his final days as\na small-time criminal master in Hobbiton known as Sharkey (from the\nOrkish _sharkû,_ meaning “old man”), until he was overthrown in the\nBattle of Bywater. In the aftermath of that battle Frodo confronted\nSaruman and exiled him from the Shire, but before he could leave, Gríma\nWormtongue killed Saruman by slitting his throat with a dagger, on the\nvery doorstep of Bag End.\n\nLegacy\n\nAfter his departure from Orthanc, King Elessar entered the tower with\nthe intent of re-ordering that realm. Inside, Elessar's men found many\ntreasures that Saruman had conned off of King Théoden. There was a\nsecret closet that could only be found with the aid of Gimli; it\ncontained the original Elendilmir, which had presumed to be lost forever\nwhen Isildur perished in the Gladden Fields, as well as a golden chain\nwhich was presumed to have once borne the One Ring.\n\nFate\n\nSaruman, being a Maia, did not truly die. His spirit separated from his\nbody much like Sauron's after the Downfall of Númenor. As an incorporeal\nspirit, he should have been called to the Halls of Mandos, but the tale\nimplies that he was barred from returning. Tolkien indicated that his\nspirit was left naked, powerless and wandering, never to return to\nMiddle-earth:\n\n\nNames\n\n-   CURUMO is the Quenya name for Saruman. Its Tengwar spelling is , and\n    its IPA pronunciation is .\n-   CURUNÍR is the Sindarin name for Saruman the White. It roughly\n    translates to mean “man of skill”. Curunir was the original name\n    given to Saruman as the leader of the Wizards, or Istari, who first\n    came to Middle-earth to combat the evils of Sauron. Late in the\n    Third Age around the time of the War of the Ring, this name was less\n    known and rarely used save among the Elves and even rarely used by\n    them except for their leaders, such as Elrond in Rivendell, Celeborn\n    and Galadriel in Lothlórien, and Círdan at the Grey Havens.\n-   '''Saruman '''as called by Gandalf, Men in Rohan, and Men in most\n    other places.\n-   SHARKU is the name given to him by his Uruk-Hai meaning in Black\n    Speech “Old Man”.\n-   SHARKEY, a form of the word is later used by the Ruffians at the\n    Shire, from “Sharku”.\n\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nSaruman's status as chief of the Wizards and head of the White Council\n(before Gandalf) gave him arsenal to a variety of powers. Though he\nwould eventually be defeated by Gandalf in the end, Saruman's powers and\nabilities were very mighty indeed at the peak of his power.\n\nBy far Saruman's greatest power (and the only one he was able to retain\nafter the downfall of Isengard) is speech. He seems to have the ability\nto bend any but the absolute strongest minds to his will, simply by\nspeaking to them. Even with Isengard broken and Saruman's treachery\nrevealed, Gandalf had to be very careful, Saruman could ensnare almost\nanyone with the power of his voice, few can contend with his will.\nGandalf was not drawn into this power when he confronted Saruman; in\ntrying to enchant some in the company, he left others out of his\ndesigns, and thus could not ensnare everyone at once. However, even in\nthis situation, it is said that only Gandalf himself remained totally\nunmoved. Aragorn stated during this time that few other than Gandalf,\nElrond and Galadriel could resist his voice, even at this point. Saruman\nlater used his persuasive power to escape Orthanc, convincing Treebeard\nto let him go.\n\nSaruman was extremely learned in Ringlore and mechanics, and his\nknowledge enabled him to create great forges. Unfortunately, it was\nSaruman's extensive knowledge of the Rings of Power that led to his\ndownfall, as he became enamored of the power of the rings, and\nparticularly the One Ring.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nLord of the Rings film trilogy\n\n\n\nIn Peter Jackson's film trilogy, Saruman is played by Sir Christopher\nLee and is the secondary antagonist in _The Fellowship of the Ring_ and\nthe primary antagonist _The Two Towers_. Unlike the novels, he is\nportrayed as an outright second-in-command or “puppet” of Sauron and is\nreferred to only as “the White,” omitting his title of “Saruman of Many\nColours.” Lee is the only cast member to ever have met Tolkien.\n\nBy the beginning of _The Fellowship of the Ring_, Saruman has become\nconvinced that Sauron cannot be defeated; as such, he allies himself\nwith the Dark Lord. He imprisons Gandalf in Orthanc and begins creating\nUruk-hai. He tracks the Fellowship using birds and summons massive snow\navalanches and rock-slides to try and kill the heroes at Caradhras.\nSaruman's Uruks attack the Fellowship at the conclusion of the film,\nkilling Boromir and capturing Merry and Pippin.\n\nIn _The Two Towers_, Saruman recruits the Dunlendings to burn the\nWestfold, then amasses an Uruk-hai army of 10,000 to destroy Rohan. He\nis aided by Gríma Wormtongue and is depicted as having outright\npossessed Théoden. At the climax of the film, Saruman's army is defeated\nat Helm's Deep and Isengard is overrun by Ents.\n\nSaruman does not appear in the theatrical cut of _The Return of the\nKing_; Treebeard only suggests that the fallen wizard's power is no\nmore. In the extended edition, Gandalf, Aragorn, Théoden, Gimli, Merry\nand Pippin confront Saruman in Isengard at the beginning of the film.\nGandalf wishes to interrogate Saruman, but Gríma stabs Saruman at the\npinnacle of Orthanc. As Saruman falls to his death, he drops the\n_Palantir_.\n\nThe Scouring of the Shire, which is where Saruman meets his end in the\nnovels, is entirely omitted from the film adaptations. Jackson\nconsidered the Scouring anticlimactic.\n\n\n\nPeter Jackson's trilogy explicitly shows Saruman influencing the weather\nto create the snowstorm on Caradhras that defeated the Fellowship's\nefforts to cross the mountains there, although the book didn't even\nsuggest that. Though Boromir thought the storm and falling boulders\nmight be caused by some evil, saying “there are fell voices on the air;\nand these stones are aimed at us,” Aragorn and Gandalf believed it was\njust the forces of nature that might be expected on “Caradhras the\nCruel.” In the extended edition, he was also seen to shoot a fireball\nat Gandalf and others soon before his end in the trilogy.\n\nIn the film trilogy, Saruman's staff of power is a replica of his own\ntower of Orthanc, with a white crystal set between the spires. As a\ntalisman of his authority, it is also used as a walking stick. He uses\nit to duel Gandalf the Grey. Gandalf the White destroys Saruman's staff\neffortlessly in _The Return of the King_ extended edition.\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\n\n\nSir Christopher Lee reprised his role as Saruman in Peter Jackson's live\naction Hobbit trilogy. He originally expressed interest in\nvoicing Smaug the dragon, but the role ended up going to Benedict\nCumberbatch. Christopher Lee also managed to humour Peter Jackson by\nasking him “Am I still in the movie?” This refers to when Christopher\nLee's (Saruman's) death scene was cut from the theatrical version of The\nReturn of the King and he had a falling out with Peter Jackson all those\nyears ago.\n\nSaruman first appears in _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey._ He arrives\nin Rivendell for a meeting of the White Council. Saruman expresses his\ndisapproval of Gandalf's actions concerning the quest to reclaim the\nLonely Mountain and dismisses Gandalf's reasons as 'looking for trouble\nwhere none exists'. He is skeptical of the information Gandalf provides\non the Necromancer and he further dismisses the information when he\nlearns it came from Radagast the Brown, who he believes is a fool and an\nembarrassment to the Istari due to his consumption of mushrooms. When\npresented with the Morgul blade, Saruman states there is no proof that\nit belonged to the Witch-king of Angmar. Saruman sums up all of\nGandalf's concerns as nothing to worry about but states that he feels he\ncannot condone the quest of the Dwarves to reclaim Erebor. However,\nunbeknownst to Saruman, the Dwarves have already left Rivendell.\n\nIn _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_, Saruman arrives at Dol\nGuldur along with Elrond, after being summoned there by Galadriel, to\nrescue Gandalf. Saruman appears as Galadriel and Gandalf are surrounded\nby the Nazgûl and asks if she needs assistance. At this, two of the\nNazgûl turn towards him and both he and Elrond begin to battle with the\nNine. Saruman duels several of the Ringwraiths, appearing to be able to\nhandle up to two at a time. In the end, both he and Elrond overpower the\nNine and they retreat momentarily. After Gandalf is taken away by\nRadagast, Sauron appears before the remainder of the White Council along\nwith the returning Nazgûl. Saruman readies himself for further battle\nbut appears to be paralyzed with awe of Sauron's power. Galadriel rises\nin a terrifying ethereal form and begins a battle of wills with Sauron.\nSaruman barely seems to notice this, still stunned in amazement of\nSauron. Galadriel eventually gains the upper hand and banishes Sauron\nfrom Dol Guldur. After recovering from his shock, Saruman notes that\nwhile Galadriel has banished Sauron, it took nearly all of her power to\ndo it and tells Elrond to take her back to Lothlórien, When Elrond\nargues that Sauron must be found and permanently destroyed, Saruman\nreplies that without the One Ring, Sauron will never regain his full\nstrength. He then tells them to go and 'leave Sauron to me.' This is\nmost likely the point, where Saruman begins his fall into evil. Although\nhe spoke of Sauron not regaining his full power, Saruman was clearly\ndumbfounded after witnessing his power first hand, foreshadowing his\neventual loss of any hope of defeating him.\n\nThere is also a song called “The Voice of Saruman” created by the heavy\nmetal band called “Lorien.”\n\nRalph Bakshi version\n\n\n\nIn Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film of _The Lord of the Rings_, Fraser\nKerr provided the voice of Saruman. At one point in that film's\ndevelopment, film executives thought that the names “Saruman” and\n“Sauron” were too similar, and would confuse the audience, and decided\nthat Saruman should be renamed “Aruman”. This decision was eventually\nreversed, but some references to “Aruman” remained in the finished film.\nThe dialogue of Bakshi's film retained Saruman's adoption of the title\n“Saruman of Many Colours”, and the character was dressed in red. In\nRalph Bakshi's animated film, Saruman sends a swirling stream of magical\nfire from Isengard to Helm's Deep to blow apart the ramparts and walls\nof Helms Deep.\n\nRadio version\n\nPeter Howell played Saruman in BBC Radio's 1981 serialisation of _The\nLord of the Rings_."

While in Valinor he\ntook a form similar to that of the Valar, but when he left he was a\n“naked flash of light, shining in the fullness of his splendour.” He was\nsaid to be less mighty than Arien, the guardian of the Sun.

    "lotrUrl": "https://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Sauron",
    "race": "Maiar",
    "text": "SAURON (or _'Þauron (Thauron_'); Quenya; IPA: or Vanyarin; IPA: - “The\nAbhorred”), the eponymous LORD OF THE RINGS, was a fallen Maia, the\ncreator of the One Ring, and the most trusted lieutenant of his master\nMelkor (Morgoth, the first Dark Lord). After Melkor's defeat in the\nFirst Age, Sauron became the second Dark Lord and strove to conquer Arda\nby creating the Rings of Power. In the Second Age, he was defeated in\nthe War of the Last Alliance by the last line of defense: Elves and Men\nunder kings Gil-galad and Elendil.\n\nDuring that battle, Isildur managed to cut off Sauron's finger with the\nRing on it, causing the destruction of his corporeal form and scattering\nhis armies. After spending hundreds of years lying dormant and slowly\nregaining his strength, Sauron returned to power in the Third Age, but\nwas finally defeated in the War of the Ring through the destruction of\nthe One Ring by Frodo Baggins.\n\nHe was called GORTHAUR THE CRUEL by the other Maiar.\n\n\nBiography\n\nOrigin\n\n\n\nSauron was originally a Maia of Aulë the Smith; his name then was\nMAIRON, meaning “the admirable.” He learned much from Aulë in the ways\nof forging and crafting, becoming a great craftsman, and mighty in the\nlore of Aulë's people. Although he was a Maia spirit, and not as\nmighty as the Valar, Mairon was one of the most if not the most powerful\nMaiar, being far stronger than others such as Olorin and Curumo (who was\nalso a servant of Aulë).\n\nDuring this time, Mairon was as Eru had created him: good and incorrupt.\nHis greatest virtue was his love of order and perfection - his dislike\nof anything wasteful. However, this would also prove to be the cause of\nhis downfall, for in the Dark Lord Morgoth, Mairon saw the will and\npower that would help him achieve his own goals and desires faster than\nif he had pursed them on his own. So great was his allegiance that even\nin later days, after Morgoth was defeated and locked outside the\nconfines of the world, Sauron encouraged and coerced some Men to worship\nMorgoth as the one and true god. However, while Morgoth wanted to either\ncontrol or destroy the very matter of Arda itself, Mairon's desire was\nto dominate the minds and wills of its creatures.\n\nAfter allying himself with Morgoth, Mairon maintained his appearance of\nbeing faithful to the Valar, but secretly fed Morgoth information about\ntheir dealings. It was only when Morgoth established his strongholds in\nMiddle-earth that Sauron left the Blessed Realms and openly declared his\nallegiance, and ever after remained a foe of the Valar and the Free\nPeoples of Middle-earth.\n\nThe Sindar in Beleriand called him GORTHAUR, meaning “dread\nabomination”, and to the Ñoldor, he was named SAURON, meaning “the\nabhorred” or “the abominable” (a mockery of his original name).\n\nFirst Age\n\nDuring the First Age, the Ñoldorin Elves left the Blessed Realm of\nValinor in the Utter West (against the counsel of the Valar) in order to\nwage war on Morgoth, who had stolen the Silmarils of Fëanor, enchanted\ngems that glowed with light from the now-destroyed Trees of Valinor. In\nthat war, Sauron was counted as the “greatest of  servants\nthat have names”. He was soon feared as a lord of terrible phantoms and\ndreadful beasts--a shape shifter, sorcerer, and a cunning servant of his\ndark master.\n\nBefore Melkor's captivity, Sauron commanded the fortress of Angband and\nserved as Melkor's lieutenant. When the Vala Tulkas came and captured\nMelkor, Sauron had already fled and was not found.\n\nWhen Morgoth left Angband to corrupt the newly awakened Atani (Men),\nSauron directed the war against the Elves. He conquered the Elvish\nisle of Tol Sirion, so that it became known as _Tol-in-Gaurhoth_, the\nIsle of Werewolves. He was the Lord of the Werewolves there, and\nDraugluin was the sire of the Werewolves. Sauron's herald was the\nvampire Thuringwethil.\n\nAfter Dagor Bragollach, Sauron's hunters brought Gorlim and questioned\nhim of Barahir's, father of Beren, location. Gorlim told them none,\nuntil Sauron himself came forth and bartered with the man. Gorlim asked\nfor his wife Eilinel, whom he thought captured. Thus, Sauron agreed and\nGorlim yielded the information. However, Sauron revealed that Eilinel\nwas dead, and he put Gorlim to death afterward. During the Quest for the\nSilmaril, Beren and Finrod King of Nargothrond were captured by Sauron.\nThere Finrod and Sauron fought songs of power. He stripped them off\ntheir Orc disguises and cast them into the dark pits where werewolves\ndevoured their companions. When a werewolf came to attack Beren, Finrod\nwrestled with it and passed away from his injuries.\n\n\n\nSoon afterward, Lúthien and Huan the wolf-hound arrived at the bridge of\nTol-in-Gaurhoth. Sauron sent wolves to capture Lúthien, but all were\nslain by Huan. One of them was Draugluin, but he fled and told his\nmaster that Huan was there. Therefore, Sauron disguised himself as a\nwerewolf and leaped to attack Lúthien. Huan sprang and subdued Sauron.\nHe yielded the tower to Lúthien and escaped in a form of a vampire.\n\nAfter his defeat by Lúthien, Sauron played little part in the events of\nthe First Age (possibly hiding from Morgoth's wrath), and after his\nmaster was defeated and taken to Valinor in chains, Sauron seemed to\nrepent and plead to Eönwë and the victorious Host of the West for mercy.\nAlthough his plea was probably genuine, Sauron was unwilling to return\nto the Utter West for judgment, and so he fled and hid somewhere in\nMiddle-earth.\n\nSecond Age\n\nForging of the One Ring\n\n\n\nAfter lying hidden and dormant for 500 years, he began revealing himself\nonce more, and by SA 1000 he gathered his power and established himself\nin the land of Mordor in eastern Middle-earth and began building the\ndreaded Dark Tower of Barad-dûr near Mount Doom. Sauron, like Morgoth,\nsoon began raising massive armies of Orcs, Trolls, and possibly other\ncreatures, as well as corrupting the hearts of Men with delusions of\npower and wealth, chiefly Easterlings and Southrons (the Haradrim).\n\nAlthough Sauron knew that men were easier to sway, he sought to bring\nthe Elves into his service, as they were far more powerful. By about SA\n1500, Sauron put on a fair visage in the Second Age, and calling himself\nAnnatar, the “Lord of Gifts”, he befriended the Elvish smiths of\nEregion, including Celebrimbor, greatest of craftsman as he was\ndescended from Fëanor, and counseled them in arts and magic. Not all the\nElves trusted him, particularly Lady Galadriel, Elrond, and Gil-galad,\nHigh King of the Ñoldor.\n\n\n\nTo the elves who listened, Sauron gave knowledge and encouragement in\nforging the Rings of Power, though in secret Sauron forged his own, the\nOne Ring, to rule the Elvish rings. Upon that ring Sauron left the black\nspeech inscription, _Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg\nthrakatulûk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul._ In Westron the inscription\ntranslated into: _One Ring to Rule Them All, One Ring to Find Them, One\nRing to Bring Them All, and in the Darkness Bind Them._\n\nHowever, as soon as Sauron put the Ring on his finger the Elves sensed\nhis treachery, and removed their rings and hid them. Enraged, Sauron\ncame against them in open war and demanded that all the Rings of Power\nbe given to him. The Elves managed to hide the three greatest of the\nRings from him, but the other sixteen Rings of Power were either\ncaptured by Sauron, destroyed, or lost. To the Dwarves he had given\nSeven, but to Men he had given Nine, knowing that they would be the\neasiest to enslave. The Dwarf Lords who received the Rings proved to be\nvery resistant to their power, and neither “faded” nor became enslaved\nto Sauron's will. The Rings, however, created in them an insatiable lust\nfor gold, which ultimately caused a great deal of grief for the\nDwarves.\n\nAs Sauron predicted, the nine Men were all corrupted by their Rings and\nbecame the Nazgûl, Sauron's deadliest and most cruel servants. Had the\nElves not recognized Sauron's treachery and forsaken the power of their\nrings, the results would have been catastrophic for the Free Peoples of\nMiddle-earth. It seems that most if not all of the native Men of\nMiddle-earth succumbed to the power of the Ring once the Nazgûl were\ncreated; the Númenóreans were spared because of their distance. The\nElves, had they been captured in this fashion, would have become the\nslaves of Sauron, and thus Celebrimbor's resistance was of immense\nimportance in the history of Middle-earth.\n\nIn this era, during which he marshalled and commanded great armies,\nSauron became known as the Dark Lord of Mordor and his fortress of\nBarad-dûr was completed. He was very powerful even without control of\nthe Elves, and he conquered nearly all of Middle-earth during the War of\nthe Elves and Sauron. However, the armies of Númenór's King Tar-Minastir\nwere finally able to defeat him at a last battle near Gwathló or the\nGreyflood in SA 1700. Defeated but not vanquished, Sauron retreated back\nto Mordor and began recouping his strength over the many centuries.\n\n\n\nTowards the end of the Second Age, Sauron was once again powerful enough\nto raise again large armies to attempt to rule Middle-earth. By this\ntime, he assumed the titles of “LORD OF THE EARTH” and “KING OF MEN”.\nSauron's rise in power and apparent intention to crown himself the King\nof all Men offended the Númenóreans; the powerful Men descended from\nthose who had fought against Melkor in the War of Wrath. Some were the\ndescendants, through Elros, of Beren and Lúthien.\n\nLife in Númenor\n\nThese Men lived on the island of Númenor in the sea between Middle-earth\nand Valinor. The Númenóreans, who were then proud, came to Middle-earth\nwith astounding force of arms. King Ar-Pharazôn, who desired no less\nthan the kingship of Middle-earth, marched his troops all the way to\nMordor without a single battle, and demanded that Sauron abase himself\nbefore the King. Sauron could see clearly that even the most powerful of\nhis servants could not stand against the Númenóreans, and so came from\nBarad-dûr without any offer of battle. He assumed a fair form and\nflattered Ar-Pharazôn, but the King demanded that Sauron come back to\nNúmenor as a hostage. Sauron feigned unhappiness at this development but\nsecretly was delighted, for this presented him with an opportunity to\ndestroy the Númenóreans from within. After only a few short years in\nNúmenor he grew from captive to the King's most trusted adviser, and\nnearly all the King's court fawned upon him. Drawing on their fear of\ndeath, he converted many Númenóreans to the worship of Morgoth, lying\nthat Morgoth had the power to save them from mortality. As his power and\ninfluence reached its peak, he raised a great Temple in which he\nperformed human sacrifices to Morgoth. Finally, he convinced Ar-Pharazôn\nto rebel against the Valar and attack Valinor itself and claim it for\nhimself.\n\nBut here, Sauron's cunning overreached itself, for Eru then directly\nintervened - Númenor was drowned under the sea, and the great navy of\nNúmenor was destroyed and the army that reached Aman was buried under\nmountains of falling rock and imprisoned in the Caves of the Forgotten.\nThe world was bent, so that thereafter, only Elven-Ships could sail into\nthe Utter West. Sauron's body was destroyed, but his spirit was not\ndiminished, and he fled back to Mordor bearing the Ring, where he slowly\nrebuilt a new body and his strength during the time known as the Dark\nYears. From this point on, he lost the ability to assume a fair shape,\nand ruled now through terror and force. A few faithful Númenóreans led\nby Elendil were saved from the flood, and they founded Gondor and Arnor\nin Middle-earth.\n\nLoss of the Ring\n\n\n\nAfter learning that Elendil, whom he had most hated, had survived and\nwas ordering a realm on his borders, Sauron, after a while, made war\nwith them. He struck too soon, however, and had not restored most of his\nstrength, whereas the Elven-king, Gil-galad had increased his power on\nMiddle-earth in his absence. Therefore, when Gil-Galad allied with\nElendil to create the Last Alliance and together fought Sauron, they\nfinally defeated his armies at the Battle of Dagorlad, and laid siege to\nBarad-dûr for seven years. Finally, Sauron himself came forth and dueled\nboth Elendil and Gil-galad, slaying them both singlehandedly. Then\nIsildur, son of Elendil, took up his father's broken sword, Narsil and\ncut the One Ring from Sauron's finger. Sauron's physical body was\ndestroyed. With nearly all of his power stored in the ring, he was\nvanquished when it was cut from his finger. Without their leader's dark\nwill driving them on, Sauron's armies were routed and fled, and thus,\nhis campaign to defeat the free peoples was seemingly ended, and his\ngreatest weapon taken from him.\n\nBut while Isildur had taken the ring, he could not bring himself to\ndestroy it in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged, instead he\nbecame corrupted by the One Ring and kept it for himself. He was\neventually betrayed by it a few years later, and slain by Orcs at\nGladden Fields. The Ring fell into the river Anduin, and was lost for\ncenturies before being found by the two Stoorish friends Smeagol and\nDéagol.\n\nThird Age\n\nDespite his defeat, Sauron was not vanquished permanently. Though\ngreatly weakened, and in non-corporeal form, he still existed, due to\npouring most of his native power, strength, and will into the One Ring.\nThus, as long as it existed, he could never be truly defeated, and\nduring the first thousand years of the Third Age, he lay in hiding,\nslowly recovering his strength until he was once again able to create a\nbody for himself.\n\nThe Necromancer of Dol Guldur\n\n\n\nIn the year TA 1000, Sauron at last began to rise again, taking the\nstronghold of Dol Guldur, the Hill of Sorcery, in southern Mirkwood in\nTA 1050. There, he was disguised as a dark sorcerer known as “THE\nNECROMANCER”, and the Elves did not realize at first that he was\nactually Sauron returned.\n\nAround this time, the Valar sent the five Wizards, or Istari, including\nGandalf Greyhame, who later changed into Gandalf the White, to oppose\nSauron and rally the free peoples of Middle-earth against him.\n\nWhile Sauron continued to gather his strength, the Ringwraiths\nreappeared in the year TA 1300, and began steadily assaulting the\nNumenorian kingdoms in exile until, one by one, they fell. Whether the\nWitch King was acting on his own, or was being guided by Sauron, is not\nknown.\n\nSuspecting that Sauron had returned and was guiding the Nazgûl, the\nwizard Gandalf infiltrated the fortress in TA 2063 to confirm his\ntheory, but Sauron fled into the East to conceal his identity. This\nmarked the beginning of the Watchful Peace, which ended with Sauron's\nreturn to Dol Guldur in TA 2460. During the same year, the One Ring was\nfinally discovered by the stoor Smeagol and his friend Deagol.\n\n\n\nGandalf the Grey made a second intrusion into Dol Guldur in TA 2850, and\nfinally discovered that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron. Eventually,\nthe White Council put forth their might and drove Sauron from Dol Guldur\npermanently in TA 2941. Without the Ring in his possession, Sauron could\ndraw on only the smallest fraction of its strength, so that his enemies\nwere able to drive him from Dol Guldur with relative ease. However, the\nDark Lord, having had ample time to prepare, was willing to abandon Dol\nGuldur, and returned to Mordor, where he openly declared himself in TA\n2951, and began preparations for his final war against the free peoples\nof Middle-earth.\n\nSauron bred immense armies of Orcs and allied with and enslaved Men from\nthe east and south. He gathered his most terrifying servants, the Nazgûl\n(_airi_ in Quenyan), or Ringwraiths, each wearing one of the nine rings\ndesigned for mortal men. He adopted the symbol of a lidless eye, and was\nable to exert his will over Middle-earth, so that the Eye of Sauron\nbecame a symbol of power and fear.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nAfter the creature Gollum, who had previously possessed the ring, was\ncaptured, Sauron had him tortured and learned that he once had a magic\nring, and from him he heard the words _Shire_ and _Baggins_. He deduced\nthat Gollum's ring was the One Ring, and sent his servants, the dreaded\nNazgûl, to find _Shire_ and search for _Baggins,_ so that the One Ring\nmight be found and returned to him.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Sauron had allied with Saruman the White (another fallen\nMaia, or Istari), whom he had ensnared into his service, expecting the\nwizard to move against Rohan and thus remove one of the major threats\nSauron faced in his planned conquest of Gondor and the remaining Elves.\nSaruman failed however, and Sauron lost his most potent ally as well as\nSaruman's massive orc army of Uruk-hai.\n\nShortly after Saruman's defeat, Peregrin Took looked into the Palantír\nthat Saruman had possessed and accidentally communicated with Sauron,\nwho believed that Saruman had captured either the Halflings bearing the\nRing, or some who might know of it. However, shortly thereafter Aragorn\ntook the Palantir and revealed himself to Sauron with the intent of\ncausing him unease. Upon seeing Aragorn, Sauron realized that Saruman\nhad fallen and concluded that the heir of Isildur carried the One Ring.\nFearful that his enemies would use the Ring against him, Sauron sped up\nhis plans and attacked the city of Minas Tirith in Gondor sooner than he\nhad planned, seeking to raze the city and crush last true human\nresistance to his rule before his enemies could fortify it.\n\nFortunately, due to the combined efforts of Gondor, Rohan, and the\nDúnedain of Arnor, Sauron's army was defeated. Despite still possessing\nmore than enough armies to destroy Minas Tirith and enough military\nstrength to easily conquer Middle-earth once Gondor fell, doubt began to\ngrow on Sauron. As such, he watched and waited, hoping for a period of\nstrife between Aragorn and other potential Ringlords in which he could\nmove out and take the Ring for himself.\n\nDownfall\n\nDespite their successful repulsion of Sauron's armies at Minas Tirith,\nGandalf and Aragorn knew that the bulk of Sauron's forces remained in\nMordor, readying themselves for another, deadlier strike against the\ncity. Filled as Mordor was with Sauron's troops, Frodo stood almost no\nchance of reaching Mt. Doom undetected. In light of the situation,\nAragorn called for a council consisting of the major commanders of all\nthe forces present in Minas Tirith, and appointed Gandalf to be their\noverlord until the crisis had passed. Gandalf made it clear to all those\npresent that, despite their great victory, they ultimately could not\nhope to defeat Sauron's armies by force. Therefore, they had two options\navailable. They could station their remaining force, considerably\ngreater than it had been before the battle due to the reinforcements\nfrom Rohan and southern Gondor, at Minas Tirith and hope to endure\nSauron's next attack. Or, they could take a force to the Black Gate and\nattempt to challenge Sauron directly. This force, as Gandalf suggested,\nwould only need to be great enough to challenge battle, and the rest of\ntheir forces could remain behind to garrison Minas Tirith. This option,\nthough suicidal for all those involved, would serve to distract Sauron\nfrom gazing into his own land, through which the Ringbearer would be\ntrekking. Furthermore, Gandalf theorized that once Sauron learned that a\nforce too small to pose any real threat to him was on its way to the\nBlack Gate to directly assault Mordor, that he would likely believe that\nwhomever was leading the attacking force would have the One Ring in\ntheir possession. Gandalf believed that Sauron would assume that the\nRing itself would influence its wielder, and that in the wielder's pride\nin his newfound power, he might be foolish enough to challenge Sauron's\nmight with a force too small to assault Mordor in earnest.\n\nTheir ploy worked, as Sauron marshaled most of his remaining forces and\nmarched them towards Udun to crush the Men of the West and regain his\nprize. This action left the Plains of Gorgoroth largely deserted and\nallowing Frodo and Sam to reach Mt. Doom with far less difficulty than\nthey would have otherwise had. However, once Frodo reached the Crack of\nDoom, he finally succumbed to the power of the Ring. As he put it on and\nprepared to leave Mt. Doom, Sauron suddenly became aware of him,\nimmediately drawing his gaze towards the mountain. Though enraged,\nSauron was suddenly gripped with terror having realized his own folly,\nand he frantically sent the Ringwraiths towards the mountain to retrieve\nthe Ring. He was too late however, and Gollum, after taking the Ring\nfrom Frodo, slipped and plunged into the Cracks of Doom, and the Ring\nwas unmade. The earth shook as a great shockwave rippled across Mordor,\nand the foundations of Barad-dûr were finally destroyed, causing the\ngreat fortress to fall into ruin once and for all. Mt. Doom was\ncompletely destroyed in a cataclysmic eruption that consumed the eight\nremaining Nazgul, who had left their combat with the Great Eagles to\nrace to Mount Doom, in its fiery ruin.\n\nWith his source of power gone, Sauron was utterly defeated and his\narmies were destroyed or scattered, bereft of the driving will behind\ntheir conquest. With the Ring's destruction, Sauron was permanently\nrobbed of his physical form, reducing him to a malevolent spirit that\nhovered above Mordor as a “huge shape of shadow, impenetrable,\nlightning-crowned, ...terrible but impotent,” only to be blown away by a\ngreat wind.\n\n\n\nWith the destruction of the Ring, the vast majority of Sauron's being\nand his power was forever lost. With that, Sauron's power was forever\ncrippled, and the threat of his dominion was forever removed.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_SAURON_ is the Quenya term for “the Abhorred”. In Sindarin, it is\ntranslated as _GORTHAUR_ from _gor_ (“horror, dread”) and _thaur_\n(“abominable, abhorrent”).\n\nOther names\n\nHis original name was said to be MAIRON (“the Admirable”, from _maira_\nmeaning “admirable, excellent”), a name he used while in Númenor, adding\nthe title “Tar” for “Tar-Mairon” (“King Excellent”). When disguising\nhimself in the Second Age, he called himself ANNATAR (“Lord of Gifts,\n_anna_ = gift and _tar_ = king, lord”), ARTANO (“High-smith”), and\nAULENDIL (“Friend of Aulë”).\n\nHis name is sometimes seen written as THAURON (ÞAURON), an earlier\npronunciation of _Sauron_.\n\nTitles\n\n-   THE ENEMY\n-   THE NAMELESS ENEMY\n-   THE DECEIVER\n-   THE DARK LORD (Post-First Age)\n-   THE LORD OF BARAD-DÛR\n-   THE LORD OF MORDOR\n-   THE NECROMANCER (First Age/Third Age)\n\nEarlier names\n\nTHÛ was Tolkien's earliest name for Sauron, in the original Lay of\nLeithian. Thu is reintroduced as an alternate name for Sauron in Beren\nand Luthien (2017).\n\n_TEVILDO_, before that, was the name of the forerunner character to\nSauron, a “Prince of Cats” who is a villain told of in the stories of\n_The Book of Lost Tales_. In Beren and Luthien (2017) Tevildo is\npresented as a separate character from Thu/Sauron, and one of Morgoth's\nother minions.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nDespite being the title character of _The Lord of the Rings_, Sauron is\nnotable in that he never directly appears during the events of the\ntrilogy. Nowhere is any detailed description given of what he looks\nlike, other than in vague terms.\n\nIn _The Silmarillion_, however, Sauron is described as being a shape\nchanger, and took many forms, including that of a serpent, a vampire,\nand a great wolf. After Morgoth's fall, Sauron appeared in fair form as\n“Annatar”, the Lord of Gifts, and maintained this appearance until the\nFall of Númenor, in which he was unable to ever take fair form ever\nagain. _The History of Middle-earth_ includes a passage vaguely\ndescribing how the Númenoreans saw him: “Upon that ship which was cast\nhighest and stood dry upon a hill there was a man, but greater than any\neven of the race of Numenor in stature...And it seemed to men that\nSauron was great; though they feared the light of his eyes. To many he\nappeared fair, to others terrible; but to some evil.”\nA few clues are given as to Sauron's appearance as the Dark Lord, after\nhe lost his ability to take a fair form: Tolkien described Sauron in one\nof his letters as having the form of a man of more than human stature,\nbut not gigantic, and as an image of malice and hatred made visible. He\napparently gave off great heat, so much so that Gil-galad was burned to\ndeath by his mere touch, and Isildur described Sauron's hand as black,\nyet burning like fire, suggesting that his entire body was blackened\nfrom fire and heat.\n\nGollum, having apparently seen Sauron directly, described him as having\nonly four fingers on his black hand, suggesting that Sauron was unable\nto regenerate the finger from which Isildur took the One Ring, similar\nto how the wounds Morgoth took from Fingolfin never healed. He was not\nconfined to a flaming eye in a tower.\n\nIn addition to his physical appearance, Sauron also apparently had an\naura of incredible malevolence. A passage in _The Silmarillion_\ndescribes him as having a “dreadful presence,” and daunting eyes.\nFurthermore, his mere presence could bend all but the strongest\nwills.\n\nRegarding Sauron's personality, Tolkien had this to say from his\nletters:\n\nPhilosopher and Tolkien scholar Peter J. Kreeft proposes that Sauron is\nin fact the main character of _The Lord of the Rings_, inasmuch as he\nhas the largest significance to the work of good and evil in the story,\ngiven his shared essence with the Ring; and given the title's referral\nto him.\n\n\nWeapons and powers\n\nSauron was among the mightiest of the Maiar. Originally of Aulë's\npeople, he acquired great “scientific” knowledge of the world's\nsubstances and how to use them. He would retain this knowledge\nthroughout his tenure as the Dark Lord in Middle-earth, using it to\nforge the One Ring and construct his fortress of Barad-dûr. Sauron also\nseemed primarily linked to the use of fire, and as Morgoth's chief\nlieutenant, his ability to tap into the fires in the earth was of great\nvalue.\n\n\n\nAmong Sauron's chief powers were deception and disguise: In the First\nAge Sauron took on many forms. His battle against Luthien and Huan in\n_The Silmarillion_ has him taking on no less than four separate shapes:\nhis “normal” shape, presumed to be that of some kind of terrible dark\nsorcerer, a great wolf, a serpent, and finally a vampire “dripping blood\nfrom his throat upon the trees” (“Of Beren and Lúthien,” _The\nSilmarillion_). At the end of the First Age, Sauron took on a fair form\nto appeal to the Captain of the Hosts of the Valar and ask for pardon.\nIn the Second Age, Sauron took up that fair form again and used it under\nthe alias “Annatar” to deceive the Elves into creating the Rings of\nPower. The level of deception required to fool the Elves of Eregion must\nhave gone beyond simply taking on a fair form. Sauron was literally\ninstructing the Elves to make artifacts that while capable of great\ngood, were ultimately purposed for his own domination and were imbued\nwith power to arrest the natural order of the world. The Elves were\nunaware of who they were dealing with until the eleventh hour, and only\nnarrowly escaped his trap. Centuries later, Sauron was able to deceive\nthe Númenóreans and steer them directly to their own destruction under\npromises of eternal life. Such destruction is a testament to Sauron's\nmanipulative nature and ability to twist the perceptions of his enemies.\n\n\n\nAn interesting dichotomy is set up between his deceptive nature and his\nsymbol. While rarely appearing personally and deceiving all but the most\nwary, he represented himself as an all seeing eye that could pierce all\ndisguises. He himself was able to disguise himself by changing shape and\ntaking a fair form. But after the Fall of Númenor he was incapable of\ntaking physical form for many years, and then later became a horrific\nDark Lord. After losing the Ring it took even longer for him to regain\nphysical form, although by the War of the Ring he had regained it.\n\nThe extent, nature, and specifics of Sauron's power are largely left to\nthe imagination. Like his master Morgoth, he was capable of altering the\nphysical substance of the world around him by mere effort of will.\n\n\nSigns and Symbols\n\nThe Symbol of Sauron was the _Eye of Sauron_, particularly after he\narose in Mirkwood at Dol Guldur. The Evil Eye is also the most popular\nrepresentation of Sauron, though it is but a representation of his will\nand semi-omniscient. It is known as The Eye of Sauron in _The\nSilmarillion,_ and in _The Lord of the Rings_ is also known as the\n_Great Eye,_ the _Eye of Barad-dûr,_ the _Red Eye,_ the _Lidless Eye,_\nand the _Evil Eye._ The term _Red Eye_ is also used to refer to the\nactual Eye of Sauron.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nSince the earliest versions of the _Silmarillion_ legendarium (as\ndetailed in the History of Middle-earth series), Sauron has undergone\nmany changes. The prototype of this character was TEVILDO, Prince of\nCats, who played the role later taken by Sauron in the earliest version\nof the story of Beren and Lúthien in _The Book of Lost Tales_. Tevildo\nlater (but still in the _Book of Lost Tales_ period) was transformed\ninto THÛ, the Necromancer. The name was then changed to GORTHÛ, SÛR, and\nfinally to SAURON. _Gorthû_ in the form GORTHAUR remained in _The\nSilmarillion_. In Númenor he was known (according to the _Notion Club\nPapers_ and associated writings) as _ZIGÛR_.\n\n_Beren and Luthien_ (2017) reintroduces some of the ideas from _The Book\nof Lost Tales_ into the complete tale of Beren and Luthien, however\nTevildo is introduced as a separate character to Thu/Sauron in its\nadaptation of the story.\n\nPrior to the publication of _The Silmarillion_, Sauron's origins and\ntrue identity were unclear to those without full access to Tolkien's\nnotes, so that early editions of the _Guide to Middle-earth_ described\nSauron as “probably of the Eldar elves”.\n\n\nAppearances\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Hobbit_ (Only mentioned as “the Necromancer”)\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n-   _The Silmarillion_\n-   _The Children of Húrin_\n-   _Unfinished Tales_\n-   _The History of Middle-earth_\n\nIn films\n\n-   _An Unexpected Journey_ (As the “Necromancer”)\n-   _The Desolation of Smaug_ (As the “Necromancer” and as himself)\n-   _The Battle of the Five Armies_\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_\n-   _The Return of the King_\n\nIn video games\n\n-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth_\n-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II_\n-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of\n    the Witch-king_\n-   _The Lord of the Rings: Conquest_\n-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age_\n-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_\n-   _LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game_\n-   _LEGO The Hobbit: The Video Game_\n-   _Guardians of Middle-earth_\n-   _Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor_\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\n_The Lord of the Rings_ film trilogy\n\nSauron's primary appearance in Peter Jackson's trilogy is as the Eye of\nSauron, a titanic, flaming eye atop Barad-dûr; many characters refer to\nit as “the Eye” or “the Great Eye.” His prior physical form was as a\nmassive being clad in nine-foot-tall black armor, seen only in two\ncontexts: in flashbacks to the War of the Last Alliance throughout the\ntrilogy, and very briefly in the center of the Eye in an extended scene\nwith Aragorn and the _palantír_ in _The Return of the King_. When Sauron\nspeaks, it is telepathically through the One Ring or the _Palantír_; he\nis voiced by Alan Howard. Sala Baker portrays his physical form.\n\n“_There is no life in the void, only death._”\n\n- Sauron in _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n\nAs in the books, Sauron is the primary antagonist throughout the films.\nHe is depicted as an almost god-like entity whose mere presence, even\nwhen mediated by a medium like the _Palantír_, causes immense pain and\ninjury. Most of his bidding is achieved through his various servants\nsuch as the _Nazgûl_ and Saruman, who calls him “the Lord of the Earth.”\nSauron is most extensively depicted in the prologue to _The Fellowship\nof the Ring_, shown forging the One Ring and leading his armies at the\nBattle of Dagorlad in the War of the Last Alliance. He wears black armor\nand a mask based on Tolkien's description of Morgoth in _The\nSilmarillion_, and wields a giant mace capable of killing scores of men\nin one hit.\n\nSauron was originally intended to appear in physical form at the climax\nof _The Return of the King_, appearing at the Battle of the Morannon to\nfight Aragorn. However, this was ultimately scrapped from the film due\nto the fact it was not in the book and the developers believed it would\ntake the main focus away from Sam and Frodo. Furthermore, Jackson\nbelieved it would take away from Aragorn's act of sacrifice.\n\nThe Eye of Sauron's feline appearance is a reference to the character of\n“Tevildo” in the first drafts, who took the form of a cat.\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\n\n\nSauron's role from _The Hobbit_ is greatly expanded in Jackson's\n_Hobbit_ film trilogy. He is voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch.\n\nSauron appears in _An Unexpected Journey_ in the form of a black,\nhumanoid ghost, alluding to Tolkien's description of the Necromancer as\na man with blackened skin. He is briefly witnessed in this form by\nRadagast.\n\nIn the _The Desolation of Smaug_, Sauron reveals a greater extent of his\npowers. He is first seen speaking with Azog, ordering him to break off\npursuit of Thorin II Oakenshield, whose head he had promised the Orc, in\norder to lead his armies. When Gandalf arrives in Dol Guldur to\ninvestigate tales of an evil there, Sauron first confronts him as a mass\nof black smoke. After killing Thráin II and initiating a brief duel with\nthe Grey Wizard, Sauron is able to overpower the wizard and reveals\nhimself as an armored figure within the shape of an enormous, flaming\neye.\n\nIn _The Battle of the Five Armies_, Galadriel, Elrond, and Saruman (the\nWhite Council) travel to Dol Goldur to free Gandalf. There, Sauron\nreleases the _Nazgûl_ upon them, but the Ringwraiths are defeated by the\nCouncil. It is then that Sauron appears as a spectral armored form\nwithin a flaming eye, accompanied within the fire by the Ringwraiths'\nghostly forms. Sauron threatens the Council with the fall of the East\nand the rise of Angmar, but is engaged by Galadriel (in her spectral\nform) in a magical duel of minds. Sauron cannot overcome Galadriel, and\nhe flees as a ball of fire into the East. Afterward, Saruman promises\nthe Council that he will handle Sauron personally.\n\nThe extended edition confirms Sauron has forged an alliance with Smaug,\nas well as showing him murdering Thrain during his battle with Gandalf.\n\nVideo games\n\n-   In _The Lord of the Rings Online_, Annatar was depicted in a mural\n    in the ruins of Tham Mírdain. He was called Antheron (Gift Lord),\n    because Turbine doesn't have the rights to the name Annatar. In the\n    session play quest 'Daughter of Strife' from Volume I: Book XV,\n    where the player takes on the character of Narmaleth, Sauron is also\n    encountered in his disguise of Annatar (Antheron), at the time he\n    taught the elves of Eregion the secrets of the Rings.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   In the strategy game ''The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for\n    Middle-earth II, ''Sauron is one of the Ring Heroes, the other beng\n    Galadriel, which can be summoned when a player successfully finds\n    Gollum and take the One Ring by killing him. He can only be summoned\n    by the evil factions Mordor, Isengard and Goblins. Sauron is one of\n    the strongest, if not, the strongest unit in the game, as he is very\n    hard to kill and able to instantly kill most infantry and cavalry\n    units with his mace. More powerful units, such as Trolls and Ents\n    are still no match for him in small amounts, being easily killed by\n    a few blows of his mace. Sauron is also able to summon fiery rocks\n    from the skies and demoralize enemy units, causing them to run\n    around in panic. When Sauron is killed, he explodes violently,\n    heavily damaging any enemy units in the vicinity. Upon his death, he\n    drops the One Ring, which may be picked up to summon another Ring\n    Hero.\n\n\n\n-   In the 2014 _Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor_ video game, Sauron\n    appears before Celebrimbor as Annatar, the Lord of Gifts, and\n    deceives him into creating the Rings of Power. After the secret\n    forging of the One Ring, Annatar takes Celebrimbor to Mordor to\n    pefect the One Ring. Celebrimbor later escapes Mordor with the Ring\n    and uses its power to challenge Sauron into battle. At the last\n    moment, the Ring slips from Celebrimbor's finger. As vengeance,\n    Sauron transforms back into Annatar and proceeds to kill\n    Celebrimbor.\n-   In the 2017 sequel to the above, Middle-earth: Shadow of War, he\n    ends up fighting Celebrimbor despite still being weakened by the\n    loss of the One Ring. Despite putting up a good fight, he is\n    overwhelmed by Celebrimbor and his new host Eltariel planning on\n    dominating him with the power of their own New Ring. Before\n    succumbing, he cuts off Eltariel's ring finger like Isildur had done\n    to him years earlier, and consumed Celebrimbor's wraith. While he\n    survives, this forces him into a new form; a burning eye at the top\n    of Barad-Dur, locked in a battle of wills with the elf until the One\n    Ring is destroyed decades later.\n-   \n\n&nbsp;\n-   Sauron appears in both LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game\n    and LEGO The Hobbit: The Video Game; in the first he is a boss and\n    playable character while he is featured as a playable character in\n    the latter.

    "race": "Maiar",
    "text": "“DURIN'S BANE” refers to the particular BALROG of Morgoth that had fled\nfollowing Morgoth's defeat during the War of Wrath to live and slumber\ndeep within the depths of the Dwarven kingdom of Moria.\n\nAlthough its true name and history are largely unknown, this Balrog\nbecame an important figure during the War of the Ring, eventually being\nawakened by the Dwarves of Moria, wreaking destruction upon them. Moria\nbecame left to the Balrog, and became known as a place of darkness and\nfear for hundreds of years, and it was not until the Fellowship of the\nRing had passed through Moria and inadvertently awakened the Balrog that\nit was finally slain in a great duel with the wizard Gandalf.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nDurin's Bane was one of the Maiar spirits that existed before The\nCreation of the world (of the same race as Gandalf and Saruman), who\ndescended into Arda with the Valar. It was eventually seduced and\ncorrupted by Melkor, becoming one of the Valaraukar and joining with the\nother balrogs in Morgoth's service. The balrog fought in many battles of\nthe War of the Jewels, up to and including the War of Wrath. It somehow\nmanaged to survive Morgoth's defeat, fleeing east and taking refuge\nbeneath the Misty Mountains.\n\nFor more than five thousand years, the balrog lay dormant at the roots\nof the mountain Barazinbar beneath the dwarf kingdom of Khazad-dûm. It\nremained undisturbed throughout the Second Age and most of the Third\nAge, until the miners of Dwarf-King Durin VI awoke it when they mined\ntoo deeply and too greedily in their search for mithril. The balrog slew\nDurin, and was thereafter known as Durin's Bane.\n\n\n\nThe dwarves attempted to fight the balrog, but its power was far too\ngreat. Despite their efforts to hold Khazad-dûm against it, King Náin\nand many of the dwarves were killed, and the survivors were forced to\nflee. News of the disaster reached the Silvan Elves of Lothlórien, who\ncalled the balrog the _Nameless Terror_ (not knowing its true nature at\nthe time) and began to refer to Khazad-dûm as _Moria_ (dark abyss).\n\nFor five hundred years, Moria was left to the balrog. Sauron began to\nput his plans for war into effect around the year TA 2480 of the Third\nAge, and sent orcs and trolls to the Misty Mountains to bar all of the\npasses. Some of these creatures came to Moria, where they stayed in\nuneasy alliance with the balrog, whom they feared.\n\nTolkien did not clarify whether Sauron was aware of the balrog's\npresence prior to this time, and thus the full extent of their alliance\nremains unclear.\n\nThe Balrog had a small but important role at the Battle of\nAzanulbizar, the climactic battle in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. In\nTA 2799, the dwarves finally defeated the majority of the orcs occupying\nMoria, but Dáin II Ironfoot, having slain the orc Azog, felt the terror\nof the Balrog at the gate and declared that Moria itself remained beyond\ntheir power to conquer. Despite an attempt to recolonize Moria by Balin\nin TA 2989, Durin's Bane remained a menace in the ancient kingdom of the\nDwarves, its true nature hidden to the outside world.\n\n\n\nIn January of TA 3019, the Fellowship of the Ring traveled through Moria\non their way to Mordor. There, they were attacked in the Chamber of\nMazarbul by orcs. The Fellowship fled through a side door, but when\nGandalf, who was also a Maia, tried to place a “shutting spell” on the\ndoor to block the pursuit behind them, the Balrog entered the chamber on\nthe other side and cast a counterspell. Gandalf spoke a word of command\nto stay the door, but the door shattered and the chamber collapsed. The\ncompany fled with Gandalf, but the orcs and the balrog, taking a\ndifferent route, caught up with them at the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. At the\nBridge, Legolas instantly recognized it as a Balrog, and Gimli\nrecognized it as Durin's Bane. Gandalf then challenged it in order to\nallow the others to escape.\n\nThe balrog ignited its whole body in flames, then attacked with its\nflaming sword, which melted into red-hot liquid metal when it met\nGandalf's own sword, Glamdring. The Balrog ignited its body a second\ntime, then took out its red-hot whip and swung it about. Gandalf then\nsmote the Bridge before him with his staff. The staff broke asunder, a\nblinding sheet of white flame springing up, and the bridge cracked at\nthe feet of the Balrog, who fell forward into the abyss. But as the\nBalrog fell, it swung its whip upwards. The thongs of the whip wrapped\naround Gandalf's legs, dragging him over the edge and into the darkness\nbelow with the Balrog.\n\n\n\nAfter a long fall, the two crashed into a great subterranean lake, which\nGandalf later said was as cold as the tide of death and almost froze his\nheart. The water quenched the Balrog's fire, reducing it to “a thing of\nslime, stronger than a strangling snake”. Despite this relatively weak\nstate, Durin's Bane renewed its attack on the wizard, and the two fought\nin the water, with the Balrog clutching at Gandalf to strangle him, and\nGandalf hewing the Balrog with his sword, until finally the Balrog fled\ninto ancient tunnels of unknown origin. There, Gandalf pursued the\ncreature out of the tunnels, back into Moria and up the Endless Stair.\nThe chase ended atop the peak of Zirakzigil, or Celebdil, when the\nBalrog's bodily flames were renewed, restoring much of its power. There,\nbeginning on the 23rd of Solmath, the pair of Maiar fought what was\nlater known as the Battle of the Peak. After a climactic battle that\nspanned for an increasingly broad amount of days, Gandalf prevailed and\nfinally slew the Balrog, casting it down from the peak and sending it\ncrashing onto the mountain side. The wounded and exhausted Gandalf died\nshortly afterwards, but was eventually “sent back, for a brief time,\nuntil his task was finished”. The great eagle Gwaihir the Windlord (lord\nof the Great Eagles of Middle-earth) found him and carried him to\nLothlórien where he was healed and clothed in white – he had become\nGandalf the White.\n\nThe ultimate fate of Durin's Bane is not known, as only its physical\nform died, as with all Maiar when they were “killed,” but what happened\nto the spirit of the balrog was not revealed. It is also unknown if it\nwas the last of its kind, or if there were other Balrogs who managed to\nescape the War of Wrath and remained hidden in long forgotten\nplaces.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nRalph Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings\n\n\n\nDurin's Bane appears in Ralph Bakshi's animated film, and follows\nTolkien's description in that it is bigger than a man, but not huge.\nHowever, its appearance has been mocked by reviewers, noting that it\nappears to have wings similar to a butterfly, appears to have fuzzy\nfeet, has the head of a lion-like creature, and roars repeatedly. After\nits fall into the chasm of Khazad-dûm, it changes into a half snake,\nhalf demon-like creature.\n\nPeter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nThe Balrog was also portrayed in Peter Jackson's live-action film\ntrilogy, where it was a large, black creature covered in flame. Although\nTolkien described it as being taller than a man but not huge, Durin's\nBane in the film was practically enormous, at least twenty feet tall or\nso. Rather than having a voice of any kind, when it roared, it sounded\nsimilar to an erupting volcano - the vaporous presence of heat emanating\nas its breath. Its weapons, rather than physical in nature, were\ncompletely comprised of flame, taking the form of a sword first and a\nwhip second. More than its use of obliteration, it was flames that were\nits key weapon of choice against Gandalf. The fight between the two\nplays out very much like the version in the book: Gandalf shatters the\nBalrog's fiery sword (using a magical shield which Gandalf forms around\nhimself, in conjunction with Glamdring), and then strikes bridge of\nKhazad-dûm, breaking it in half, and causing the Balrog to fall into the\ndeep abyss below. As the Balrog falls, its whip latches onto Gandalf's\nlegs and drags him into the abyss. \n\nThe Two Towers\n\nThe balrog appears in a few flashbacks in _The Two Towers_. The first\nflashback shows the events that take place following Gandalf's plunge\ninto the abyss of Khazad-dûm: Gandalf hurtles down the chasm after the\nbalrog, recovering his sword Glamdring in midair and catching up to the\nbalrog. He and the balrog attempt to kill each other as they continue to\nfall down the seemingly endless abyss, with Gandalf managing to land\nseveral blows on the balrog while it makes constant attempts to strike\nat Gandalf with its fists and claws. They fall for a few minutes, until\nthey at last crash violently into the underground lake, temporarily\nextinguishing the balrog's flames. \n\nThe second flashback shows Gandalf and the balrog now dueling atop Mount\nZirakzigil during a great storm, in which Gandalf manages to imbue his\nsword with electricity from a lightning strike and stabs the balrog\nthrough the heart, mortally wounding it and causing it to fall from the\npeak and crash onto the mountain side, its flames forever extinguished. \n\nBoard Games\n\nBalrog was introduced into the _War of the Ring_ by the game's first\nexpansion pack, the Lords of Middle-earth. He is an optional character,\na “Lesser Minion” which the Shadow Player can optionally recruit which\ngrants him the use of a special Action Die to use for various actions in\nthe game, though specifically accustomed to the use of Balrog. His\nrecruitment though comes at a cost, mustering the Elves and Dwarves upon\nnews of his arrival to war a little closer on the game's so-called\nPolitical Track.\n\nIn the game, Balrog made it harder for the Fellowship of the Ring to\ntravel past him and by adding two dice to combat rolls in battle and\noffering three re-rolls on misses, he is possibly the most powerful\ncharacter in the game when it comes to boosting combat. To limit his\nmassive strength and make his use more canonical, he can be only used if\nhe is “Awakened”, while the Free People's player can put him back to\nsleep (effectively immobilizing him) in several ways, including using\nGandalf. Though the thing is, if Balrog is rendered inactive anywhere\noutside Moria, he is permanently banished from gameplay.\n\nVideo Games\n\nIn _The Fellowship of the Ring_ video game, Gandalf battles Durin's Bane\nin a two-stage boss battle at the end of Moria. After weakening the\nbeast with his lightning bolts, Gandalf must battle it with his sword.\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth_, the balrog\nappears as a boss in the first level. The player is forced to fight the\nbalrog solely with Gandalf, using his Lightning Sword strike multiple\ntimes to kill it.\n\nIn the Evil mode, the balrog can be summoned using its respective power.\nThe balrog can ignite its sword to cause additional melee damage, strike\nwith its whip, roar to cause enemies to flee in terror, fly to certain\nareas, and most importantly, blast enemies and structures to ashes with\nits incinerate skill. The balrog, not surprisingly, is deadly in melee.\n\nThe balrog is both a boss and a playable hero in _The Lord of the Rings:\nConquest_. In the Good campaign, the player must kill it to reclaim\nMoria from the orcs, playing as Gandalf the White. In the Evil campaign,\nit appears twice: once to kill Gimli, and once to kill Treebeard. Its\nweapon in this game is a flaming sword and Fire Breath.\n\nDurin's Bane appears in _The Lord of the Rings: Tactics_ as an unique\nunit in the second mission of the game, armed with a sword of flame and\nfiery breath. In the Fellowship campaign, the player must get Aragorn,\nGimli, Legolas, and Frodo across the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, fighting off\ngoblins and using Gandalf to stall the balrog. In the Mordor campaign,\nDurin's Bane is a playable unit which is being targeted by Gandalf,\nAragorn, Boromir, and several Rangers of Ithilien; the player's goal is\nto defeat the enemy heroes before they can defeat the balrog.\n\nTwo balrogs also feature in _The Lord of the Rings Online_. The first\none, called Thaurlach, was created for the purposes of the game, and is\nthe last 'Boss' in the famous Rift Raid, a 12-player instance in the\nregion of Angmar. The other balrog, Durin's Bane, features in one of the\nintroductory quests to the Mines of Moria expansion of the game; an\nillusionary copy of it can later be fought in the Fear Wing of the Ost\nDunhoth raid.\n\nThe balrog appears in _LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game_.\nWhile its fight against Gandalf remains the same as in the film, it\nbelches at one point, causing Gandalf to wave the fumes away in disgust.\nThis same incarnation of the Balrog later appeared in _LEGO Dimensions._\n\nThe balrog is a main boss in the _The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age_,\nwhere it initially appears in a cutscene at the bottom of a mithril mine\nand is later fought on the bridge of Khazad-dûm where Gandalf becomes a\ntemporary party member.\n\nIn Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, the Legendary Graug's in-game\ndescription notes it is speculated to be a “Balrog given flesh” though\nthis is never confirmed.\n\n\nGallery"

    "text": "ALATAR (Quenya; IPA: - “After-Comer”), also called MORINEHTAR (Quenya; )\nwas a Maia and an immortal Istar wizard. He travelled to Middle-earth in\nthe Second Age with Rómestámo (Pallando), and they became the Ithryn\nLuin, or “Blue Wizards”. They travelled to the east of Arda, to\ncountries in far eastern Middle-earth such as Rhûn and Khand, where they\nwere sent to stir up rebellions against those serving Sauron. In this,\nthey were successful, and they later returned to Middle-earth in the\nThird Age and travelled East and South once again, but they never\nreturned to the West after their journey with Saruman. It is possible\nthat they became the founders of secret and magical cults, but their\nultimate fate remains unknown.\n\n\nBiography\n\nSecond Age\n\n\n\nAlatar was originally a Maia of Oromë the Huntsman named MOHRINEHTAR,\nand presumably lived in his forests on the continent of Aman, west of\nMiddle-earth. The other servants of Oromë included Rómestámo (later\nPallando), who was a friend of Morinehtar's, and whom he would later\nchoose to journey with him. At some point in the Second Age, around the\nforging of the Rings of Power, Mohrinehtar and Rómestámo were chosen to\nbecome the first of the Istari, and were sent to the East of\nMiddle-earth to stir up rebellion against Sauron and assist the few\ntribes of Men who had refused to worship Morgoth in the First Age.\n\nThird Age\n\nDuring the Third Age, the Valar selected Mohrinehtar, renamed ALATAR,\nmeaning “after-comer”, and Pallando to be two of the five Maiar to\ntravel from the Undying Lands to Middle-earth and serve as Istari\nwizards. Alatar, Curumo (Saruman the White) and Olórin (Gandalf the\nGrey) were assigned the objective of encouraging the peoples of\nMiddle-earth to oppose Sauron. However, two more joined the original\nthree Wizards and they became five. Aiwendil (Radagast the Brown) was\nchosen by Yavanna to travel with Curumo, and Alatar took Pallando the\nBlue as a companion. Upon arrival in Middle-earth, Alatar and Pallando\nwere dressed in robes of sea-blue. Due to this, they were called the\nBlue Wizards (or Ithryn Luin, in Sindarin). With Saruman, they travelled\neast in an attempt to help free the last Men of Númenor, who were now\nHaradrim and Easterlings. Later, Saruman came back to the west alone.\nHowever, Alatar and Pallando were never seen again, and their ultimate\nfate, and whether or not they failed their mission, is unknown.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nAlatar probably means “after-comer” (as he was one of the original two\nMaiar to be chosen to become Wizards and follow Sauron to Middle Earth).\nJ.R.R. Tolkien specifically stated that neither Alatar nor Pallando had\na name in the West of Middle-earth, unlike the other three Wizards (who\nall had two names). Therefore, Tolkien probably intended “Alatar” to be\nmore of a title or a description than a name. Later in his life, Tolkien\nwrote a note, suggesting that the names of the Blue Wizards were\nMorinehtar and Rómestámo. It is not clear whether these names were\nintended to replace the names Alatar and Pallando, or whether Morinehtar\nand Rómestámo were alternate names for the Blue Wizards, possibly those\ngiven to them by the peoples of Middle-earth.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nWhen Alatar came to Middle-earth, he was clothed in flesh and had the\nappearance of a wizened old man, though he did not look as old as\nGandalf. He and Pallando were dressed in robes of sea-blue, which was\nwhy they were named “the Blue Wizards”. He had a white beard which\nwas not as long as Gandalf's or Saruman's. He carried a staff, as did\nthe other Wizards, which he could use to channel his magic.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Hobbit trilogy\n\nWhen talking to Bilbo, Gandalf the Grey mentions the two Blue Wizards in\n_The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_. When Bilbo asks how many Wizards\nthere are, Gandalf states that there is him, Saruman, the two Blue\nWizards (whose names he cannot remember), and Radagast the Brown. They\nare never mentioned in the Lord of the Rings films, only referenced by\nSaruman who mentions “the rods of the five wizards” in the extended\nedition of the third film."

He was taken to Middle-earth at the bidding of Alatar, another\nIstar who took him as a friend.\n\nPallando and Alatar (known as the Blue Wizards for their sea-blue robes)\ntraveled to the east of Middle-earth with Curumo (Saruman the White) to\naid some men and subdue others, primarily the Easterlings and Southrons\nwho worshiped Sauron, and whose numbers were steadily increasing.\nSaruman later returned to the West, but Pallando along with Alatar\nstayed behind.\n\nOther than this, not much is positively known about Pallando or Alatar,\nbut it is thought that Pallando most likely failed his mission\neventually. However, in Tolkien's later years he provided an alternate\nname for the wizard, RÓMESTÁMO, meaning “helper of the East”. Here it is\nthought that rather than fail his mission altogether, Pallando perhaps\nhad the opposite fate, and he and Alatar may have in fact played some\ncrucial role in the War of the Ring and in the victory of the Army of\nthe West, unnoticed but significant.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nWhen Pallando came to Middle-earth, he was clothed in flesh and had the\nappearance of a wizened old man, though he did not look as old as\nGandalf.

The eyes of Arien were said to be too bright for even the Eldar\nto look upon. In the Years of the Trees, Arien tended to the golden\nflower gardens of Vána where Arien would water the flowers with great\nbright dews collected from the great golden Tree Laurelin. Later, Arien\nwas chosen by the Valar to carry the vessel of the Sun because she was\nthe only one who was not afraid and could bear the heats of the great\nTree Laurelin and so was unhurt by it. While in Valinor , Arien took\na physical form similar to that of the Valar; but when Arien left\nValinor, she forsook her raiment and became a “naked flame of fire,\nterrible in the fullness of her splendour”.\n\n\n\nLater on, when the great Two Trees of Valinor were destroyed by Morgoth\n and Ungoliant, the golden Tree Laurelin managed to produce one last\ngolden fruit before it died away. Subsequently Aulë, the _Greatest\nCraftmans of the Earth_, then created a vessel to hold the last golden\nfruit of Laurelin. However the Maia Tilion, chosen to steer the vessel\nof the Moon, had traversed seven times before the vessel of the Sun was\nready. So after the vessel for the Sun  also named _'Anar' _was at last\nmade ready, Arien carried the vessel of the Sun away up into the Heavens\ngiving light to the World. Hence, _Anar_ rose in glory and the first\ndawn of the Sun was like a great fire glowing upon the towers of\nthe Pelóri Mountains in Aman. And the clouds of Middle-earth was kindled\nand there was heard the sound of many waterfalls. Then indeed\nMorgoth was dismayed and he descended to the lowest pits of Angband and\nalso withdrew all his servants as well. There, Morgoth sent forth great\nreeks and darkness of clouds to hide his land from the the light of the\n_Daystar_. For of Arien, Morgoth feared with a great fear and dared not\ncome close to her having indeed no power to do so now.\n\nIt has been told that Arien was more powerful than Tilion who was drawn\nto Arien and occasionally followed Arien through the night sky but when\ncatching up to her, the Island of the Moon became burned and blackened\nby Arien's heat when in close proximity to her. Moreover, the Valar\nstored the great radiance of the Sun in many vessels, vats, and pools to\nuse for their comfort in times of darkness. As Arien was the\n“Guardian of the Sun”, she was one of the most loved of the Maiar by\nmortal Men for her first journey across the sky was the signal of the\nAwakening of Men.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Arien_' is a word that means “Maiden of Sunlight” in Quenya from _áirë_\n(“sunlight”) and _-ien_, a feminine ending.\n\nEarlier Names\n\n_URIEN_ and _URWENDI_ are the earlier names for Arien, which both meant\n“Maiden of Fire”.\n\n\nOther Versions of the Legendarium\n\nIn other writings, Morgoth wanted to claim Arien as a wife, and ravished\nher, upon which she abandoned her body and “died”, leaving the Sun to\ntravel through the skies uncontrollably and burning parts of Arda.\n\nIt was also stated that Arien, then named _Urwendi_, fell into the Sea\nand met her “death”. FIONWË, later called Eönwë, a son of Manwë, defeats\nMelkor, driven by his love for _Urwendi_.\n\nIn some versions, FIONWË, later named Eönwë, is the one who will kill\nMorgoth for his love for Urwendi (Later named Arien).\n\nIt was told that Arien and her maidens, before the rising of the Sun,\nentered into _Fôs Almir_ which was a bath of flame that would make one\npure."

Plus ever\nafterwards, Uinen was the one who restrained her Spouse's violence in\nthe seas and on the coasts.\n\nLater on, the Teleri remained long on the coast of the western seas,\nawaiting still for Ulmo to take them to Aman. Likewise, Uinen and Ossë\ncame among the Teleri at the coasts and befriended them. In addition,\nthe Teleri had much love for Uinen and her spouse, for Uinen and Ossë\ncontinued being friends with the Teleri who then dwelt by the mouths of\nthe great river Sirion of Beleriand which flowed into the sea.\nUltimately, the Teleri with their King Olwë at last reached Aman where\nthey built their dwelling as a city-haven named 'Alqualondë' on the\nshores of Eldamar in Aman. However later on, the 'Kinslaying at\nAlqualondë' took place at the Swanhaven of the Teleri where Fëanor,\neldest son of King Finwë of the Ñoldor, and his host of exiled Ñoldor\nattacked the Teleri and forcefully stole their white ships for their\nvoyage to Middle-earth. Notwithstanding though, Uinen wept for the many\nof the Telerin mariners who had been wickedly slain and tossed into the\nsea. What's more, the sea then rose in great wrath by Uinen against the\nNoldorin slayers in that so many of the Telerin ships were wrecked and\nthose of the Ñoldor in them were drowned.\n\nWhen the Hiding of Valinor took place, Ossë raised the enchanted Isles.\nThen next, Uinen enchanted those who ever managed to reach the Isles by\nweaving them in her hair before Irmo (_Master of Dreams & Desires_) put\nthem to age-long sleep.\n\nSecond Age\n\nDuring the Second Age, the mariners of Númenór would cry to Uinen for\nhelp, because she was the only one capable of calming Ossë who loved to\ncreate tumults in the seas, And the Númenóreans lived under her\nprotection while their respect for the Valar endured. Therefore, the\nNúmenóreans held the Maia Uinen in reverence as equal to the Valar.\n\n\nOther Versions of the Legendarium\n\nIn a Númenórean legend, it was told that Uinen had the Isle of Tol Uinen\nplaced in the Bay of Rómenna as a gift to the people of Númenór.\n\nIn the original story of the Sun and the Moon, it was Uinen herself who\nwove the sails for the ship of the Moon. Uinen had made them as white\nmists and foam and some were spread like glittering scales of silver\nfish while others were threaded with tiny stars looking like points of\nlight."

    "race": "Elf",
    "text": "ELU THINGOL was an Elf of the Teleri during the First Age. His brother\nwas Olwë, who became the Lord of Alqualondë, Lord of Tol Eressëa, and\nHigh King of the Teleri of Aman, both of whom may have had a second\nbrother called Elmo. He was a good friend of Finwë, the first High King\nof the Ñoldor during the times before the elves reached Aman.\n\nHe was the founder and first King of the northern Elven Kingdom of\nDoriath and was respected by all the Sindar of the Beleriand, who\nconsidered him to be the High King of the Sindar and the Lord of\nBeleriand.\n\n\nBiography\n\nSundering of the Elves\n\n\n\nElwë was born in Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees to unnamed\nparents. He first appears in the history of the Eldar when he travels\nfrom Cuiviénen with Oromë as ambassador of the Teleri to see the land of\nValinor. Interestingly, since Thingol had previously visited Valinor as\nan ambassador of the Teleri, he is debateably both of the Sindar and of\nthe Calaquendi. Upon his return, he manages to convince many of his\npeople to follow him back to that country. On the Great Journey to the\nWest, the Teleri lag behind, and do not arrive at the coast until after\nthe departure of the moving island of Tol Eressëa. Thus, they stay in\nBeleriand for many years until Tol Eressëa is brought again to fetch\nthem. By this time, many of the Teleri have grown to like Beleriand, and\ndecide to stay there. Elwë is among them, having encountered Melian the\nMaia in the woods of Nan Elmoth and fallen deeply in love with her.\nAfterwards, he disappeared for many years causing many of his people to\nlinger in Middle-earth or stay there until he could be found.\n\n\n\nRule of Doriath\n\nFor centuries Elwë remained lost until he reemerged as a respected lord\nand many of his people joined him in the great forested area of the\nBeleriand. Now known as Thingol, he and Melian become king and queen of\nthe Teleri who stay in Beleriand, who then become known as the Sindar.\nHe founded a realm in a large forested area in the Beleriand first known\nas Eglador (Land of the Forsaken). During these early days under the\nstars, Thingol and Melian have a daughter named Lúthien, who is said to\nbe the fairest woman ever to have lived.\n\nAs Lord of Beleriand, he welcomed his long lost kin now known as the\nLaiquendi or Green-elves vast lands in Ossiriand which they would name\nLindon. He was also the first elf to make contact and alliances with the\nDwarves of Belegost who helped delve the caves of the great\nFortress/City of Menegroth which became the capital of Thingol's\nkingdom. When the Dwarves first became aware of unknown but savage\ncreatures coming from out of the North, Thingol was the first to know\nabout it and not having any heavy weapons of war he once again asked the\nDwarves for their aid. They forged for him weapons and armour he needed\nto fight them.\n\nThe Quest for the Silmaril\n\nWhen Melkor returned to Middle-earth, he sought once again to master\nMiddle-earth and its peoples and declared war on them. He sent his great\nhosts of Orcs into the Beleriand starting what became known as the First\nBattle of Beleriand. Thingol led his people to victory against the Orcs\nsuccessfully driving them out of his kingdom and most of the Beleriand.\nAfterwards, Melian set the Girdle around his kingdom which would be\nknown from then on as Doriath which no one could enter without his\npermission. When the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth, he gave them leave\nto dwell in the north part and dealt only with the House of Finarfin as\nthey were kin through his brother Olwë. When he learned of the\nKinslaying at Alqualondë, he was outraged and wanted nothing to do with\nmost of the Ñoldor and their war and even outlawed the use of Quenya in\nhis kingdom.\n\nThingol was drawn into the war with Morgoth and the deadly Oath of\nFëanor when after the Dagor Bragollach, Lúthien fell in love with a man\nnamed Beren. Thingol did not wish for the two to be wedded to each\nother, as he valued his daughter very highly and disliked the race of\nMen. As a bride-price he asked for a Silmaril from the crown of Morgoth,\nthinking there was no way that Beren could fulfill this demand. Thus,\nThingol was drawn into the quarrels over the great jewels and ultimately\nthe doom of Fëanor.\n\nDeath\n\nIt was, however, this very bride-price that doomed him. After Húrin\nbrought the treasures of Nargothrond to Doriath, Thingol summoned\nDwarves of Belegost to Menegroth and invited them to work the treasure\ninto jewelry. The finest of these pieces was the Nauglamír.\n\nThe Nauglamír was the second-greatest treasure of Doriath, prized above\nall but Beren and Lúthien's Silmaril. After the smiths of Belegost\nfinished their work on the Nauglamír, Thingol requested that the Dwarves\nof Nogrod set the Silmaril in it. The Nauglamír, now bearing the\nSilmaril was held to be the fairest object in Arda.\n\nEnthralled by its beauty and greedy for the Silmaril, the Dwarves\ndemanded the necklace insisting that as dwarf work it belonged to them.\nThingol was unwilling to surrender the treasure and replies with an\nimpertinent answer. In their anger, the Dwarves attempted to slay him.\nAfter a long battle between Dwarves and elves inside the city, Dwarves\nwere driven out of the city, two escaped to Nogrod and persuaded the\ncity to march on Doriath. They escaped and told a much different story\nto their home cities and got them to march on and sack Doriath. Later\nwith the help of certain treacherous elves also possessed of the cursed\ntreasure they regained entrance past the Girdle. Thingol was lured out\non a hunt with but a small company of arms, where he was ambushed by\nwaiting Dwarves, and was slain. The fortress of the Thousand Caves was\ntaken at unawares and plundered. They could not seize nor harm Melian,\nand she left to seek Beren and Lúthien.\n\nThingol's heir was Dior Eluchil, the son of Beren and Lúthien.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ELU THINGOL_ derives from the Sindarin _Elu Sindacollo_, meaning “Elu\nGreycloak”, from _thind_ or _sinda_ (“grey”) and _collo_ (“cloak”).\n\nThe original form of his name was _ELWË SINGOLLO_ from the Quenya _el_\n(“star”) and _wë_ (“person”).\n\n\nWeapons\n\nThingol's sword was called ARANRÚTH (“King's Ire”) which later became\nthe sword of the Númenórean kings. He also owned Anglachel, the sword\nforged by Eöl who gave it to him as payment for dwelling in Nan Elmoth\nalone.\n\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nThingol underwent quite a bit of developmental changes. In some of the\nearlier writings, and in particular the drafts for The Hobbit, Thingol\nwas said to be the leader of the Dark Elves, and was a Dark Elf himself.\nThis note of him being referred to as the Dark Elf as one of his\nnicknames/titles/insults is still seen in the published _Silmarillion_:\n“...this Dark Elf in his caves!”"

    "race": "Human",
    "text": "EÄRENDIL (Quenya; IPA: ) was one of the most important figures in J.R.R.\nTolkien's Middle-earth mythology: a great Half-elven mariner who voyaged\nto Valinor and carried a star across the sky. His story is found in _The\nSilmarillion_, and there are several references to him throughout _The\nLord of the Rings_.\n\nHe is the father of Elros, the first King of Númenor, and of Elrond, the\nLord of Rivendell and an important figure in Middle-earth during the\nSecond and Third age.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEärendil was the Half-elven son of Tuor and Princess Idril daughter of\nTurgon. He was born in FA 503 and was raised in Gondolin. When he was\nseven years old, he and his parents escaped the sacking of Gondolin,\nliving afterwards in Arvernien by the mouth of Sirion. The\nsurvivors of Gondolin and Doriath mingled at the Havens of Sirion. In FA\n530, Eärendil wedded Elwing daughter of King Dior Eluchil. Two years\nlater, Elros and Elrond were born to them, and Eärendil began his voyage\nin search for Tuor and Idril, who had departed earlier over the Sea.\nWith the aid of Círdan the Shipwright, Eärendil built a ship,\nVingilótë.\n\n\n\nAt this time, Elwing had in her possession the Silmaril that Beren had\nwrested from Morgoth. News of this came to the sons of Fëanor that were\nstill living, and they attacked the people living in Arvernien, and slew\nmost of them. Círdan and Gil-Galad sent ships to help them but were too\nlate. But Elwing, rather than be captured, threw herself with the\nSilmaril into the sea, leaving her young sons behind.\n\nHearing of the tragedy that had befallen Arvernien, Eärendil then sought\nafter Valinor, and he and Elwing found their way there at last. Eärendil\nthus became the first of all mortals to set foot in Valinor. Eärendil\nthen went before the Valar, and asked them for aid for Men and Elves in\nMiddle-earth, to fight against Morgoth; and the Valar accepted his\nplea.\n\n\n\nBecause Eärendil had undertaken this errand on behalf of Men and Elves,\nand not for his own sake, Manwë forbore to deal out the punishment of\ndeath that was due; and because both Eärendil and Elwing were descended\nfrom a union of Elves and Men, Manwë granted to them and their sons the\ngift to choose to which race they would be joined (a gift that was\nfurther passed to the children of Elrond, who became known as the\nHalf-elven). Elwing chose to be one of the Elves. Eärendil would have\nrather been one of the Men; however, for the sake of his wife, he chose\nto be one of the Elves.\n\nThe Valar, having listened to Eärendil's plea, went with a mighty host\nto Middle-earth, and overthrew Morgoth, and bound him. Eärendil took\npart in the battle, riding on Vingilot beside Thorondor and the Eagles.\nIt was his blow that slew the great dragon Ancalagon and cast it down\nonto Thangorodrim, the event which, along with the sheer devastation\ncaused by the War of Wrath, led to the Ruin of Beleriand. Eärendil's\nfate was to eternally traverse the Great Ocean with the Silmaril that\nBeren and Luthien had wrested from Morgoth and guard the Sun and Moon.\n\nIn the Second Prophecy of Mandos, it is told that Eärendil will return\nfrom the sky for the love of the Sun and Moon that Melkor would blot\nout, and fight in the Dagor Dagorath.\n\n\nLater mentions\n\nThe Hobbit of the Shire, Bilbo Baggins, wrote a Song of Eärendil which\nwas sung in Rivendell, the house of Eärendil's son, Elrond.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n His father-name _EÄRENDIL_ is a\nQuenya name which means “Lover of the Sea”, from _eä_ (“sea”) and the\nsuffix _-ndil_ (“devoted to, friend, lover”). His mother-name is\nARDAMÍRË “Arda-jewel”, from the Quenya term _mírë_ (“jewel”).\n\nThe first rendering of his name, before the making of his final tale in\n_The Silmarillion_, was EÄRENDEL.\n\nThe Adûnaic translation of Eärendil is AZRUBÊL.\n\nEpithets\n\nEärendil was given many epithets: Eärendil Halfelven, Eärendil the\nMariner, Eärendil the Blessed, and Bright Eärendil.\n\nName history\n\nTolkien created the name based on Old English literature. Tolkien's\nhimself states (_Letters, 297_) that the name is derived from\nAnglo-Saxon _éarendel_. He says that he was struck by the “great beauty”\nof the name as early as 1913, which he perceived as\n\n    _entirely coherent with the normal style of A-S, but euphonic to a\n    peculiar degree in that pleasing but not 'delectable' language._\n\nThere is a poem by Tolkien dated to 1914 entitled _The Voyage of\nEärendel the Evening Star_ (published in HoME 2 267 - 269). Tolkien was\nalso aware of the name's Germanic cognates (Old Norse _Aurvandill_,\nLombardic _Auriwandalo_), and the question why the Anglo-Saxon one\nrather than the Lombardic or Proto-Germanic form should be taken up in\nthe mythology is alluded to in the _Notion Club papers_. The Old Norse\ntogether with the Anglo-Saxon evidence point to an astronomical myth,\nthe name referring to a star, or a group of stars, and the Anglo-Saxon\nin particular points to the Morning Star as the herald of the rising Sun\n(in _Crist_ Christianized to refer to John the Baptist).\n\nTolkien was particularly inspired by the lines:\n\n    _Crist_, _éala éarendel engla beorhtast / ofer middangeard monnum\n    sended_\n    “Hail Earendel, brightest of angels, sent over Middle-earth to men.”\n\nThis was the inspiration not only for the role of Eärendil in Tolkien's\nwork, but also for the term “Middle-earth” (translating _Middangeard_)\nfor the inhabitable lands (c.f. Midgard).\n\nThe first line is paralleled by Frodo's exclamation in Cirith Ungol,\n_Aiya Eärendil Elenion Ancalima!_ which is Quenya, and translates to\n“Hail Eärendil, brightest of stars.” Frodo's exclamation was in\nreference to the 'Star-glass' he carried, which contained the light of\nEärendil's star, the Silmaril. It also echoes Eönwë's exclamation who at\nthe end of the First Age greeted Eärendil and his quest in Aman.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nEärendil was described as the following:\n\n\nConcept and creation\n\n\n\nIn 1914, Tolkien wrote a poem “The Voyage of Eärendil the Evening Star”\nwhich was inspired by the “Crist” poem of Cynewulf. While studying at\nOxford, Tolkien developed a constructed language that later became known\nas Quenya. Already around 1915 he had the idea that this language needed\nan internal history and was spoken by Elves whom his invented character\nEärendil meets during his journeys. The next step in the creation of the\nunderlying mythology was the _Lay of Eärendil_, a work composed of\nseveral poems that describes the mariner Eärendil and his voyages and\nhow his ship is turned into a star. The mysterious land of Valinor and\nits Two Trees of gold and silver were first described in this cycle.\n\nTolkien's legend of Eärendil has elements resembling the medieval Celtic\nImmram legends or the Christian legend of St. Brendan the Navigator.\n\nHumphrey Carpenter in his biography of Tolkien remarked that Eärendil\n“was in fact the beginning of Tolkien's own mythology”."
