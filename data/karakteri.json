    "text": "AEGNOR was a Ñoldorin Elf, the third son of Finarfin, elder brother of\nGaladriel, younger brother of Finrod Felagund and Angrod and lord of the\nÑoldor of Dorthonion in the First Age.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nAegnor was born in Tirion sometime during the Noontide of Valinor.\nWhen Fëanor spoke in Tirion, Aegnor was moved by his words as was his\nbrother but neither spoke against their father; however, he and his\nbrothers followed the host of the Ñoldor to Middle-earth. When the\nÑoldor returned to Middle-earth, he together with Angrod held the\nnorthern slopes of the highlands of Dorthonion against Morgoth\nthroughout the time of the Siege of Angband.\n\nAegnor never married but he was in love with the Bëorian wise-woman\nAndreth, and she returned his feelings. They spent much time discussing\nMen and Elves and their fates in the world, which are fully explained in\nthe _Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth_. However, it was wartime and he did\nnot make his intentions towards her clear enough. He was killed along\nwith his brother soon after when Morgoth broke the Siege at the start of\nDagor Bragollach in FA 455.\n\n\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Aegnor_ is a Sindarin form of his Quenya name _AIKANÁR_ or\n_AIKANÁRO_, meaning “Sharp Flame” or “Fell Fire”.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn the early versions of Tolkien's legendarium (see _The History of\nMiddle-earth_), a character named _EGNOR_ appears. In some of the\nearliest stories (see: _The Book of Lost Tales_), this was the name of\nthe father of Beren (who then was a Ñoldorin elf, not a Man as in later\nwritings). It is far from certain if this Egnor was the same character.\n\n\nTrivia\n\n-   The name _Aegnor_ was also assigned to the movie-only character\n    Figwit for the trading card game.",

It was\nmentioned that Adanel had many other brothers and sisters as well, and\nlike Magor her brother, they also might have been younger than she.\n\n\nBiography\n\nAdanel ended up marrying Belemir of the House of Bëor, a great-grandson\nof Bëor the Old himself. Adanel was the mother of five children and her\nfifth and last child was a son Beren. Adanel's son Beren later was\nthe grandfather of his great namesake grandson the renowned Beren\nErchamion (_Beren the One-handed_) of whom his daughter the famed\nEmeldir _the Man-hearted_ named after him. Thus, Adanel was the\ngreat-grandmother of Beren son of Emeldir, her granddaughter.\n\nThe Wise of the People of Marach were the only Men to preserve the tale\nof their original sin, when, soon after their awakening, the Men chose\nto worship Melkor instead of Eru. Adanel told this tale (called the\n'''Tale of Adanel '''in Morgoth's Ring) to Andreth of the House of Bëor.\n\nAndreth was a very distant niece of Adanel's husband Belemir through the\nline of Baran, the eldest son of Bëor, and Belemir through the line of\nhis grandfather Belen who was the youngest son of Bëor. In addition,\nAndreth's nephew Barahir married Adanel's granddaughter Emeldir.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Adanel_ was a Sindarin name of unclear meaning. It is likely\nto have come from the words _adan_, meaning 'man' (as a race, rather\nthan in gender), and _el_, meaning 'star'. This would give the meanings\n“star of man” or perhaps “man of the star” to her name.",

Amandil, who was the leader of the Faithful in Númenor though\nnot openly, supported the ban of the Valar and for the old traditions\nwhereas Pharazôn followed the counsel of his father and that of his own\nwill. Pharazôn deprived the Lords of Andúnië of their lordship due to\ntheir support of the old King Tar-Palantir and he commanded Amandil to\ndwell in Rómenna. Andúnië he took and made it to his chief harbour of\nhis ships but he did not dismiss him from his council or in any other\nway molest him.\n\nIn SA 3261 Pharazôn brought Sauron to Númenor and over the years he was\nbeing convinced by the lies of Sauron.\n\nSensing the impending doom of Númenor, he urged his son Elendil not to\ninterfere in the upcoming war, but to expect, and prepare for, a forced\ndeparture from the island. He himself decided to set sail for Valinor,\nthere to plead with the Valar for forgiveness and mercy for the\nNúmenórean people, since at least a few had remained faithful.\n\nHe departed into the West either SA 3310 and SA 3316, just before\nthe Great Armament was ready to launch in an attempt to reach Valinor\nand save Númenor. He set sail in a small ship with three servants dear\nto him (though no names are given for them) at night from Rómenna\nsteering East, like it was his goal to reach Middle-earth, but soon he\nturned and journeyed into the West.

    "text": "AMROD was the youngest son of Fëanor, along with his twin brother Amras.\nOf Fëanor's twin-sons, Amrod was the eldest.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nAmrod and his brother Amras were born sometime during the Years of the\nTrees in Valinor. During the rebellion of the Ñoldor, Amrod and his\nbrothers swore the Oath of Fëanor. Before they left for Middle-earth,\nNerdanel Amrod's mother begged Fëanor to leave her two youngest son with\nhim or at least one of them. Fëanor refused her, and Nerdanel prophesied\nthat one of them will not set foot on Middle-earth.\n\nIn accordance to _The Silmarillion_, Amrod did not die during the\nBurning of the ships at Losgar. In this version, Amrod and his six\nbrothers rescued their father during the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. He had\nalso held the lands of Estolad with his brother. In FA 583, Amrod and\nAmras died during the Third Kinslaying at the Havens of Sirion.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_AMROD_s father-name is TELUFINWË “Last Finwë”, most likely from the\nQuenyan _tella_ (“hindmost, last”). The short form of this name is\nTELVO. Originally, his mother-name was AMBARUSSA “Top-russet”, from\n_amba_ (“upwards”). When Fëanor insisted on different names for the\ntwins, Nerdanel called Amrod UMBARTO, “the Fated”. Fëanor later changed\nit to AMBARTO, “Upwards-exalted”, from _amba_ and _arta_ (“exalted,\nlofty”).\n\nEarlier names\n\nIn earlier versions, Amrod was given the name DAMROD and his brother\nAmras was named DIRIEL.\n\nOther Names\n\nIn Old English, Amrod's name is DEORMOD “the Brave-hearted”.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn _The Peoples of Middle-earth_, when arriving in Middle-earth, Fëanor\nhad roused his sons to burn the ships. Yet in the morning, Amras noticed\nthe absence of his twin brother Amrod and asked for him. Amras explained\nto his father Fëanor that Amrod did not sleep on the ground in great\ndiscomfort but slept instead in one of the ships. Then in great dread,\nFëanor perceived that his son Amrod had wished to sail back and rejoin\nhis mother Nerdanel in Valinor but the ships had all been burnt now with\nhis son in one of them. Thus sadly, Amrod perished there in Losgar when\nthe ships had been set to fire by the command of his father. And none\ndared to speak to Fëanor about this matter afterward.\n\nIt was mentioned that Amrod and his twin brother Amras remained alike,\nbut eventually Amrod, the elder of the two, grew darker in hair. It was\nalso said that among his twin-sons, Fëanor held Amrod to be more dear to\nhim.",

    "text": "AMROTH was an Elven king of Lothlórien.\n\nAlthough he was descended from the Sindarin Elves, Amroth was pleased to\nadopt the customs of the Galadhrim and to live in a high house on Cerin\nAmroth, a hill in Lothlórien.\n\n\nBiography\n\nThird Age\n\nWhen Amroth's father, Amdír, was killed during the Battle of Dagorlad in\nSA 3434, Amroth became the King of Lothlórien. He became the last of the\nruling Sindar over Lorien.\n\nAmroth and Nimrodel\n\nAmroth's beloved, a beautiful Elf Maiden named Nimrodel, regretted that\nElves from Beleriand, which was under assault by Morgoth, were being\nadmitted into Lothlórien. She believed that these foreign Elves brought\nwars and destroyed the peace that Lothlórien's inhabitants had once\nenjoyed. When a Balrog was awakened in Moria by the delvings of the\nDwarves and they fled north to the Grey Mountains, many of the Elves\nliving on the west side of Lórien moved inward, and the Galadhremmin\ntightened their guard. Nimrodel, living on the west side of the forest\nby the stream that afterward bore her name, preferring not to mix with\nthe Galadhremmin who she deemed invaders of the golden wood, instead\nfled to Fangorn Forest in TA 1981 (Third Age). Amroth followed her to\nthe forest, which was much closer to Lothlórien than it later became.\nUpon attempting to enter the forest, Nimrodel was halted and badly\nfrightened by the movements and murmurings of the Black Huorns who\nbarred her entrance. She lingered on the edge of the forest, unsure of\nwhat to do. Amroth found her there a day later.\n\nThere, Amroth and Nimrodel spoke long and earnestly with one another,\nAmroth begging for her favor. Eventually, the Elf-Maiden promised that\nshe would marry Amroth only if he brought her to a peaceful land.\n\nAmroth vowed that he would leave the Elves of Lothlórien, even if a time\ncame when they needed him most. However, none of Middle-earth was at\npeace and Amroth believed that the Elves would never enjoy peace again.\nHe suggested that he and Nimrodel should travel across the Sundering\nSeas to the Undying Lands.\n\nAmroth knew that the Sindarin Elves had come to the Bay of Belfalas, a\nhaven south of Lothlórien, long ago. Although the majority of those\nelves had left Middle-earth and sailed to the Undying Lands, Amroth was\naware that some of their kind still built ships and offered passage to\nany of the other elves wishing to leave Middle-earth. After Amroth made\nthe necessary arrangements, he and Nimrodel left Lothlórien.\n\nHowever, they somehow became separated on their journey. Amroth looked\nfor Nimrodel, but his search was unsuccessful so he continued south\ntowards the Sundering Seas.\n\nFate\n\nAt the havens on the Bay of Belfalas, Amroth found that the few\nremaining Sindarin Elves who remained in Middle-earth were preparing to\nleave aboard the only seaworthy ship that they had. Although they\nwelcomed Amroth aboard, they were unwilling to wait for Nimrodel. They\nhoped that she was in Gondor and that she had not attempted to cross the\nWhite Mountains, where many unfriendly Men and evil creatures lived.\n\nThe summer was almost over and it would soon be autumn, which was\nexpected to bring dangerously strong winds. However, the Elves saw that\nAmroth was extremely upset. They had removed all their possessions from\ntheir houses on the shore, so they waited with Amroth on their ship for\nmany weeks. Summer passed and autumn came, but Nimrodel still did not\narrive.\n\nOne night, one of the fiercest storms in the recorded history of Gondor\ncame from the Northern Wastes, swept through Eriador and caused an\nenormous amount of destruction to Gondor. Many of the ships that the Men\nof Gondor had built were swept away from the coast and sank. The wind\nbroke the light Elven-ship from its moorings and hurled the vessel far\nfrom the Bay of Belfalas, driving it towards the coasts of Umbar.\n\nAt dawn of the following morning, the storm dissipated. However, when\nAmroth awoke, he saw that the ship was already far from its port. Full\nof despair, Amroth screamed Nimrodel's name, threw himself into the\nwater below and drowned.\n\nThe ship was never seen again in Middle-earth, although it is likely\nthat the vessel left the Circles of the World and eventually reached Tol\nEressëa, an island that the Eldar used to enable them to complete the\nGreat Journey.\n\nNeither Elves nor Men ever saw Amroth or Nimrodel again, but there were\nmany legends concerning Nimrodel's fate.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe Elf Maiden shared her name with a stream where she once lived, which\nindirectly flowed into the Bay of Belfalas. According to Elven legend,\nAmroth's voice continued to emanate from the sea and Nimrodel's voice\noften resonated from the stream that shared her name.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Amroth_ means “upclimber” or “high climber”, from _am_ (“high, going\nup”). It refers to his having built and dwelt in a flet high in the\ntrees on Cerin Amroth. The name was of Lemberin language (later\n“Avarin”), along with other Sindarin names such as _Legolas_,\n_Nimrodel_, and _Thranduil_.\n\n\nAmroth in Song\n\nLegolas sang an extract from a long and sad song to Frodo Baggins by the\nbanks of the Nimrodel. The song, which depicted the story of Amroth and\nNimrodel, was sometimes sung in Rivendell.\n\n An Elven-maid there was of old, A shining star by day: Her mantle white\nwas hemmed with gold, Her shoes of silver-grey.\n\nA star was bound upon her brows, A light was on her hair As sun upon the\ngolden boughs In Lórien the fair.\n\nHer hair was long, her limbs were white, And fair she was and free; And\nin the wind she went as light As leaf of linden-tree.\n\nBeside the falls of Nimrodel, By water clear and cool, Her voice as\nfalling silver fell Into the shining pool.\n\nWhere now she wanders none can tell, In sunlight or in shade; For lost\nof yore was Nimrodel And in the mountains strayed.\n\nThe elven-ship in haven grey Beneath the mountain-lee Awaited her for\nmany a day Beside the roaring sea.\n\nA wind by night in Northern lands Arose, and loud it cried, And drove\nthe ship from elven-strands Across the streaming tide.\n\nWhen dawn came dim the land was lost, The mountains sinking grey Beyond\nthe heaving waves that tossed Their plumes of blinding spray.\n\nAmroth beheld the fading shore Now low beyond the swell, And cursed the\nfaithless ship that bore Him far from Nimrodel.\n\nOf old he was an Elven-king, A lord of tree and glen, When golden were\nthe boughs in spring In fair Lothlórien.\n\nFrom helm to sea they saw him leap, As arrow from the string, And dive\ninto the water deep, As mew upon the wing.\n\nThe wind was in his flowing hair, The foam about him shone; Afar they\nsaw him strong and fair Go riding like a swan.\n\nBut from the West has come no word, And on the Hither Shore No tidings\nElven-folk have heard Of Amroth evermore.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nAmroth was briefly the son of Galadriel and Celeborn, brother of\nCelebrían. In this version, he lived in Eregion and fled with Galadriel\nand Celebrían between TA 1350 and TA 1400.\n\nHe was called as Ammalas in earlier writings, and was the lover of\nInglorel (Nimrodel).",

She was wise in thought and\nlearned in the lore of Men and thus was called '''Saelind\n_'(_Wise-heart) ''by the Elves of her time. In her earlier life she\nlived in the house of Belemir in Ladros, where she had learned the lore\nof the House of Marach from Adanel.\n\nAndreth was deeply in love with Aegnor, son of Finarfin. The love was\nreturned but never fulfilled, since Aegnor departed from motives of\nwisdom as he felt his coming death, thus they never married and had no\nchildren. She had a close friendship with Aegnor's brother Finrod\nFelagund, who often visited her during the Siege of Angband to converse\nand debate with her on the matters of Elves and Men. One such\nconversation was written down and later known as _ATHRABETH FINROD AH\nANDRETH_, where she and Finrod discussed differences between Elves and\nMen.\n\n\n\nShe probably died when Morgoth broke the Siege of Angband in Dagor\nBragollach in FA 455 of causes unknown.

    "text": "AR-PHARAZÔN, also known as AR-PHARAZÔN THE GOLDEN, was the twenty-fifth\nand last King of Númenor. Of all the Kings of Númenor, he wielded the\nmost power, but used it most unwisely; his desire for more eternal life\ncaused the destruction of Númenor and the Change of the World.\n\n\nBiography\n\nAr-Pharazôn was the son of Gimilkhâd, the leader of the King's Men\nduring the reign of Tar-Palantir of Númenor. Ar-Pharazôn grew into a Man\nof great strength, stature, and will, not unlike the ancient heroes of\nthe Edain. In these earlier days, he was good friends with Amandil, the\nfuture Lord of Andúnië and his line of people. However, he was his\nfather's child and thus was instructed to follow in the ways of the\nKing's Men.\n\nAr-Pharazôn became a man of great pride and was eager for more wealth\nand glory. He grew restless in his homeland and was often abroad leading\nlike-minded Númenóreans in the wars that they were waging against the\nmen of Middle-earth. In this he fared well on both land and sea for he\nwon great wealth, and gained great respect as a captain. When he finally\nreturned home, the people rejoiced in him and he was very popular and\ngenerous with the wealth and fortunes he won in Middle-earth.\n\nUpon the death of his uncle, Tar-Palantir, who had no son, Ar-Pharazôn\ndecided to wed his daughter, Míriel, which was against her will. As\nTar-Míriel was the rightful Ruling Queen of Númenor, Ar-Pharazôn was\nable to usurp the throne. He gave to his wife the name Ar-Zimraphel,\nrefusing to use the Elven speech, whilst persecuting the last vestiges\nof the Faithful.\n\nAs time passed, it came to his attention that Sauron, the Lord of\nMordor, was expanding his power throughout Middle-earth and was being\ncalled the Lord of Men. Ar-Pharazôn, ever prideful, resolved to\nchallenge him lordship of the earth. In SA 3261, he marched upon Mordor\nwith an army so powerful that Sauron's forces simply deserted him. But\nSauron was cunning, and he feigned to be overawed at Ar-Pharazôn's\nmight. However, Ar-Pharazôn did not trust Sauron, and brought him back\nto Númenor as a hostage. However, Sauron quickly took advantage of his\nsituation to gain Ar-Pharazôn's trust, and by way of careful flattery,\nlies and half-truths, he soon became the king's closest and most trusted\nadvisor. He was able to corrupt Ar-Pharazôn, convincing him to worship\nMorgoth in the hope that he would be able to cheat mortality. Some of\nthe results of Sauron's cunning were the erecting of a Great Temple to\nMorgoth, intense persecution of the Faithful, and the chopping down of\nthe White Tree of Númenor. Soon the king and his followers were\nworshiping Morgoth openly and burning innocents at the altar of the\ntemple as sacrificial offerings to appease the false god.\n\nThen, as Ar-Pharazôn felt the bite of old age upon him, Sauron was able\nto convince him to attack Valinor and claim the right to immortality by\nforce. He began the building of a huge fleet, the Great Armament, to\nattack Valinor in SA 3310 and finally broke the Ban of the Valar,\nlanding on the shores of the Undying Lands in SA 3319. The Valar then\nlaid down their guardianship of the world and called upon Eru, the One.\nHe sank Ar-Pharazôn's fleet and all of Númenor beneath the ocean,\nchanging the shape of the world. Valinor was no longer connected to\nMiddle-earth, and mortals could no longer find it. Afterwards, only\nelves and a few remarkable exceptions could reach it following the\nStraight Road into the far west. Ar-Pharazôn and his mighty host who\nlanded on Aman were buried by mounds of dirt and remain in the Caves of\nthe Forgotten until the last battle, or Dagor Dagorath. He and his great\narmy's role in the end of days has not been made clear.\n\n\nLegacy and successors\n\nAr-Pharazôn's tyrannical rule and rebellious resolve to break the Ban of\nthe Valar and make war upon the west led to the end of the royal\nNúmenórean line. Instead, the line of Elros was continued from the long\nline of the Lords of Andúnië. As Amandil of Andúnië did not return from\nhis venture into the west, his son Elendil became the successor of a new\nkingdom that would rule from Middle-earth in exile. His two surviving\nsons, Isildur and Anárion followed him into exile and would in turn\nbecome his successors as well.\n\nAr-Pharazôn was remembered by the surviving Númenorean lineage with a\nsort of grudging respect. Despite his errors, he was the first and last\nHuman capable to beat and humiliate the powerful dark lord Sauron by\nhimself. In remembrance to this feat, in Umbar was erected a monument to\nthe Golden King of Númenor: a dark crystal globe, on a tall white\ncolumn, which absorbed sunrays and glimmered in the night for everyone\nto see. The monument was destroyed when Umbar corsairs swore allegiance\nto Sauron.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis chosen royal name of _Pharazôn_ which means “GOLDEN” was in Adûnaic;\nhis name in Quenya was _Tar-Calion_ with _Calion_ meaning “SON OF\nLIGHT”.",

He and Isildur lived at the\nhaven of Rómenna on the east coast of the island of Númenor. Their\nfather was Elendil son of Amandil, the Lords of Andunie.\n\nIn SA 3262, the Kings of Númenor, took Sauron captive and brought him to\nNúmenor. Sauron allowed himself to be taken because he wanted to corrupt\nthe Númenóreans. He used their desire for immortality and power to\nconvince them to renounce Eru and worship Morgoth.\n\nAs Sauron's influence increased, the Faithful began to prepare to leave\nNúmenor. They filled their ships with many of their prized possessions,\nincluding the Palantíri.\n\nSauron's lies convinced Ar-Pharazôn that he could achieve immortality in\nthe Undying Lands. In SA 3319, Ar-Pharazon set out with a great fleet\nintending to take the Undying Lands by force but when he set foot on the\nshore, Eru caused the Seas to open up. The fleet sank and Numenor was\ndestroyed by a great wave.\n\nFounding of Gondor\n\nThe ships of the Faithful were spared, and a great wind from the west\nsent them to the shores of Middle-earth. Elendil landed in the north,\nwhilst Isildur and Anárion came to the Mouths of the Anduin in the\nsouth. Elendil and his sons established the Northern-kingdom of Arnor\nand the Southern-kingdom of Gondor in SA 3320. Elendil was the High King\nof both realms, but he dwelled in Arnor and committed the rule of Gondor\nto his sons.\n\nIsildur and Anárion had their thrones side by side in the Great Hall of\nOsgiliath, the city they founded on the Anduin. Anárion lived in Minas\nAnor on the western side of the Anduin, while Isildur made his home in\nIthilien on the eastern side of the Anduin. Anárion had one of the\nPalantír, which he used to communicate with his brother and father.\n\nWar of the Last Alliance\n\nWhen Sauron and the forces of Mordor began attacking Gondor in SA 3429,\nIsildur and the royal family were forced to move from Minas Ithil to\nAnnúminas in Arnor. Anárion successfully defended the city and realm and\nwas able to drive the enemy from Ithilien. The War of the Last Alliance\nbegan in SA 3434. Sauron's forces were defeated in the Battle of\nDagorlad and the army of the Last Alliance entered Sauron's realm and\nlaid Siege of Barad-dûr. The siege lasted seven years and many Men and\nElves were killed. Anárion was killed in SA 3440 in Mordor when a stone\ncast from Barad-dûr, either from falling debris or by catapult, killed\nhim.\n\nHis father Elendil later fought Sauron, and his brother Isildur would be\nthe one to cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand with Isildur's broken\nsword.\n\nTwo years later, his fourth child Meneldil becomes the third King of\nGondor, and so his three older children may have been female or they\nmight have died with him.",

    "text": "ARAGORN II, the son of Arathorn II and Gilraen, also known as ELESSAR\nand STRIDER, was the 16TH CHIEFTAIN OF THE DÚNEDAIN OF THE NORTH; later\ncrowned KING ELESSAR TELCONTAR (March 1, 2931 - FO 120 or SR 1541), the\n26th King of Arnor and 35th King of Gondor - and first High King of\nGondor and Arnor since the short reign of Isildur. He was a great ranger\nand warrior, and as Isildur's heir he bore the shards of Narsil,\nreforged and renamed _Andúril_, in the War of the Ring.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly years\n\n\n\nAragorn was a descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur. His ancestor Arvedui was\nwedded to Fíriel, who was descended from Anárion, who bore their son\nAranarth, making Aragorn the last descendant of Anárion as well.\n\nWhen he was only two years old, his father Arathorn was killed while\npursuing orcs. Aragorn was afterwards fostered in Rivendell by Elrond.\nAt the request of his mother, his lineage was kept secret, as she feared\nhe would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity\nas the descendant of Elendil and Heir of Isildur became known. Aragorn\nwas renamed _ESTEL_ and was not told about his heritage until 2951.\n\n\n\nElrond revealed to “Estel” his true name and ancestry when he was\ntwenty, and gave to him the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil.\nElrond withheld the Sceptre of Annúminas from Aragorn until he “came of\nthe right” to possess the item. It was also around this time that\nAragorn met and fell in love with Arwen, Elrond's daughter, newly\nreturned from her mother's homeland of Lórien where she had visited her\ngrandmother Galadriel.\n\nAragorn thereafter assumed his proper role as the sixteenth Chieftain of\nthe Dúnedain and the Rangers of the North, and left the comforts of\nRivendell for the wild, where he lived with the remainder of his people,\nwhose kingdom had been destroyed through civil and regional wars\ncenturies before.\n\nAragorn met Gandalf the Grey in 2956 and they became close friends.\nHeeding Gandalf's advice, Aragorn and the Rangers began to guard a small\nland known as the Shire inhabited by the diminutive and agrarian\nHobbits, and he became known among the peoples just outside the Shire's\nborders as STRIDER.\n\nFrom TA 2957 to TA 2980, Aragorn undertook great journeys, serving in\nthe armies of King Thengel of Rohan, and Steward Ecthelion II of Gondor.\nMany of his tasks helped to raise morale in the West and counter the\ngrowing threat of Sauron and his allies, and he earned priceless\nexperience which he would later put to use in the War of the Ring.\nAragorn served his lords in disguise and his name in Gondor and Rohan\nduring that time was THORONGIL (“Eagle of the Star”). With a small\nGondor squadron of ships, he led an assault on the long-standing rebel\nprovince of Umbar in 2980, burning many of the Corsairs' ships and\npersonally slaying their lord during the battle on the Havens. After the\nvictory at Umbar, “Thorongil” left the field and, to the dismay of his\nmen, went east.\n\n\n\nLater in 2980, he visited Lórien, and there once again met Arwen. He\ngave her the heirloom of his House, the Ring of Barahir, and, on the\nhill of Cerin Amroth, Arwen pledged her hand to him in marriage,\nrenouncing her elvish lineage and accepting the Gift of Men: death.\n\nElrond withheld from Aragorn permission to marry his daughter until such\na time as his foster son should be king of _both_ Gondor and Arnor. As\nboth Elrond and Aragorn knew, to marry a mortal, Arwen would be required\nto choose mortality, and thus deprive the deathless Elrond of his\ndaughter while the world lasted. Elrond was also concerned for Arwen's\nown happiness, fearing that in the end she might find death (her own and\nthat of her beloved) too difficult to bear.\n\nBefore the events of _The Lord of the Rings_ properly take place,\nAragorn also traveled through the Dwarven mines of Moria, to Harad,\nwhere (in his own words) “the stars are strange.” Tolkien does not\nspecify when these travels occurred nor does he indicate what happens\nwhen Aragorn visits.\n\nIn 3009, Gandalf grew suspicious of the origin of the ring belonging to\nthe Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, which later turned out to be the One Ring, the\nsource of the Dark Lord Sauron's evil power. Aragorn went at his request\ninto Rhovanion in search of Gollum, who had once possessed the Ring. He\ncaught the creature in the Dead Marshes near Mordor, and brought him as\na captive to Thranduil's halls in Mirkwood, where Gandalf questioned\nhim.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nAragorn joined Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's adopted heir, and three of his\nfriends at the Inn of the Prancing Pony in Bree. Though originally\nthe hobbits were suspicious of Strider, they eventually trusted him and\nprepared to escape Bree and the Ringwraiths. These four had set out\nfrom the Shire to bring the One Ring to Rivendell. Aragorn was aged 87\nat that time, nearing the prime of life for one of royal Númenórean\ndescent. With Aragorn's help, the Hobbits escaped the pursuing\nNazgûl. The elf-lord Glorfindel later arrived and led them to\nRivendell.\n\nThere, Aragorn chose to join Frodo, thus forming the Fellowship of the\nRing that was formed to guard Frodo, tasked with destroying the Ring in\nthe fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. Besides Aragorn, Gandalf, and Frodo,\nthe company included  Frodo's cousins Pippin and Merry, his best friend Samwise Gamgee,\nLegolas the elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and Boromir of Gondor.\n\n All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost;\nThe old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by\nthe frost. From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the\nshadows shall spring; Renewed shall be Blade that was Broken, The\ncrownless again shall be king.\n\n    — Bilbo's poem about Aragorn\n\nBefore the group set out, the shards of Narsil were reforged, and the\nrestored blade was named Andúril.\n\nAragorn accompanied the group through an attempt to cross the pass of\nCaradhras and through the mines of Moria. He helped protect Frodo from\nan Orc captain and became group leader after Gandalf was presumed lost\nin battle with a Balrog. Aragorn led the company to Lórien, where\nLady Galadriel gave him the Elessar.\n\nAfter Lórien, Aragorn and the Fellowship sailed down the river Anduin to\nthe Falls of Rauros. Though his original plan was to set out for Gondor\nand aid its people in the War, he felt responsible for Frodo after the\nloss of Gandalf.\n\n\n\nAfter passing into the Argonath, the Fellowship camped in Amon Hen.\nFrodo saw that Boromir had been driven mad by the influence of the One\nRing trying to take it. Frodo put the ring on, rendering him invisible,\nand ran away from Boromir. Frodo climbed to the high seat on Amon Hen;\nfrom there he could see Sauron's eye looking for him. The Hobbit felt\nthe eye but it was distracted by Gandalf the White later found in\nFangorn Forest by (Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli looking for Merry and\nPippin.) Frodo would struggle against the power of Sauron, finally\ntaking the ring off. Then Frodo knew what had to be done: He was to go\nalone to Mordor to destroy the ring. On the way back to the river he\nmeets Sam, who goes with him.\n\n\n\nAt this same time, the others were attacked by Saruman's Uruk-hai and a\nbattle ensued. During the ensuing battle, Boromir was killed defending\nMerry and Pippin and giving up his desire for the ring in a last attempt\nto resist the ring. After discovering that Frodo had left, Aragorn and\nthe others decided that they would leave Frodo and Sam to continue their\nquest on their own. Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn put Boromir's body and\nwar gear in one of the elven boats as a funeral boat and tribute to\nBoromir for his bravery and courage. His body would be sent to the Falls\nof Rauros.\n\nWhile Frodo continued his quest with Samwise Gamgee, Aragorn, Legolas\nand Gimli went to Rohan to free Merry and Pippin, who had been captured\nby the Uruk-hai working for Saruman.\n\nThe Three Hunters\n\n\n\nIn the fields of Rohan, the Three Hunters Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli\nencountered Éomer, who had recently been pursuing rumours of an orc raid\nin the area. From Éomer, Aragorn learned that the Orcs who had kidnapped\nMerry and Pippin had been destroyed and that the Hobbits had not been\nfound. Dejected, he led Legolas and Gimli to the site of the battle.\nClues led Aragorn to believe that the Hobbits might still be alive, and\nhe led the Three Hunters into Fangorn Forest. They did not find the\nHobbits, but they did find Gandalf the White, sent back from Valinor to\ncontinue his struggle against Sauron. Gandalf told the Three Hunters\nthat the Hobbits were safe with the Ents of Fangorn.\n\n Where now are the Dunedain, Elessar, Elessar? Where do thy kinsfolk\nwander afar? Near is the hour when the lost should come forth, And the\nGrey Company ride from the North. But dark is the path appointed to\nthee: The Dead watch the road that leads to the Sea.\n\n    - Galadriel's message to Aragorn\n\nTogether, Gandalf and the Three Hunters travelled to Edoras, where\nGandalf freed Théoden from Saruman's enchantment and helped him organize\nthe Rohirrim against Saruman. He allied with Théoden and led the\nrefugees to Helm's Deep.\n\n\n\nAragorn, Legolas and Gimli then help the people of Rohan in the Battle\nof the Hornburg, in which they conclusively and victoriously defeated\nSaruman's army.Afterward Aragorn went with Gandalf to Isengard only\nto find Isengard in ruins by the work of the Ents. Aragorn, being\npresent with Gandalf, Theoden, Éomer, Legolas and Gimli, negotiate in a\nfinal parley with Saruman. Saruman at first tries to bend Theoden to his\nwill and at first Theoden is almost swayed but then he masters his will\nand refuses to join with Saruman. Saruman then sneers at Theoden and\nturns his attention to Gandalf and tries to sway him, only to be laughed\nat. Then Gandalf offers him a chance of repentance without limits.\nSaruman turns white in his face at this, sadly in the end however\nSaruman refuses to repent out of pride and to leave Orthanc. Gandalf\nbreaks Saruman's staff as he is no longer the head and is banished from\nthe Order of Wizards and The White Council. After Saruman crawls away,\nGrima Wormtongue then throws the Palantír of Orthanc at Gandalf as he\nand the others are leaving the Orthanc tower. But misses not being able\nto decide who he hated more Gandalf or Saruman. Thus ending the Battle\nof the Hornburg and the Battle of Isengard.\n\nReturn of the King\n\n\n\nIn order to defend the city, Aragorn travelled the Paths of the Dead,\nand summoned the Dead Men of Dunharrow who owed allegiance to the King\nof Gondor. It had been prophesied by Isildur and Malbeth the Seer that\nthe Dead would be summoned once more to pay their debt for betraying\nGondor a millennia before. With their aid the Corsairs of Umbar were\ndefeated.\n\nAragorn, a small force of Rangers, and a large contingent of men and\nsoldiers from the southern regions then sailed up the Anduin to Minas\nTirith. When they arrived at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Aragorn\nunfurled a standard that Arwen had made for him which showed both the\nWhite Tree of Gondor along with the jeweled crown and seven stars of the\nHouse of Elendil. With the help of the southern forces the armies of\nGondor and Rohan rallied together and defeated Sauron's army.\n\nThe Steward Denethor II declared that he would not bow to a descendant\nof Isildur (years before, he had seen “Thorongil” as a rival to his\nfather's favor). Aragorn healed Faramir, Denethor's last heir, winning\nhim the immediate recognition of Faramir as rightful heir to the throne;\nhis humility and self-sacrifice gained him the hearts of the inhabitants\nof Gondor's capital city. Aragorn's healing abilities, moreover, were a\nsign to the people of Gondor of the identity of their true king; as\nIoreth said, _“The hands of the King are the hands of a healer, and so\nshall the rightful king be known.”_ The people hailed him as King that\nsame evening.\n\nDespite his immediate success and popularity, however, and despite his\nclaim to the throne through raising the royal banner, Aragorn decided to\nlay aside his claim for the time being. He knew that if he aggressively\npromoted his claim, rival claimants or debates as to his legitimacy were\nnot out of the question, and this could be a fatal distraction for\nGondor at a time when the West needed to be united against Sauron. So,\nto avoid conflict, after he had healed people during the following\nnights of March 15–16, he left Minas Tirith and symbolically refused to\nenter it again until he was crowned King on May first.\n\nAs Reunited King of Gondor and Arnor\n\n\n\nUpon Sauron's defeat, Aragorn was crowned as KING ELESSAR, a name given\nto him by Galadriel. He became the TWENTY-SIXTH KING OF ARNOR,\nTHIRTY-FIFTH KING OF GONDOR and the first HIGH KING OF THE REUNITED\nKINGDOM, though it would be several years before his authority was\nfirmly reestablished in Arnor. His line was referred to as the House of\nTelcontar (Telcontar being Quenya for “Strider”). Aragorn married Arwen\nshortly afterwards, and ruled the Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor until 120\nof the Fourth Age. His reign was marked by great harmony and prosperity\nwithin Gondor and Arnor, and by a great renewal of cooperation and\ncommunication among Men, Elves, and Dwarves, fostered by his vigorous\nrebuilding campaign following the war. Aragorn led the forces of the\nReunited Kingdom on military campaigns against some Easterlings and\nHaradrim, re-establishing rule over much territory that Gondor had lost\nin previous centuries.\nDuring his coronation, Aragorn sang Elendil's Oath: _“Et Eärello\nEndorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta!”_\n(“Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. In this place I will\nabide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.”)\n\nDeath and End of Reign\n\n\n\nWhen in the year 120 of the Fourth Age, King Elessar realised his days\nwere at an end, he went to the House of the Kings in the Silent Street.\nHe said farewell to his son Eldarion and his daughters and gave Eldarion\nhis crown and sceptre. Arwen remained at Aragorn's side until he died.\nShortly a year after Aragorn died, Arwen soon died of a broken heart.\nEldarion began his reign as the Second King of the Reunited Kingdom\nafter his father's and mother's death.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nTolkien gives a brief but detailed description of him in _The Lord of\nthe Rings_: lean, dark, tall, with “a shaggy head of dark hair flecked\nwith grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keen grey eyes.”\n\nIn _The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen_, he was said to be often grim and\nsad, with unexpected moments of levity. Some time after the\npublications of the books, Tolkien wrote that he was six feet six inches\ntall.\n\nAragorn possessed Elven wisdom due to his childhood in Rivendell with\nElrond and the foresight of the Dúnedain. He was also a skilled healer,\nnotably with the plant _Athelas_ (also known as Kingsfoil). He was also\na mighty warrior and an unmatched commander; after the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields, he, Éomer, and Imrahil were said to be left unscathed,\neven though they had been in the thick of the fighting.\n\nThough there is no indication of his ever doubting his role and destiny\nas the future king of the Reunited Kingdom and one of the leaders of the\nwar against Sauron (as he did in Peter Jackson's film), he was not\nimmune to self-doubt, as he doubted the wisdom of his decisions while\nleading the Fellowship after the loss of Gandalf in Moria, and blamed\nhimself for many of their subsequent misfortunes.\n\nOn one occasion, his pride (or reverence for his heritage) led to\ncomplications, as he refused to disarm and leave his sword Andúril (a\npriceless heirloom of Númenor and one of the weapons which slew Sauron)\nat the door of Edoras, as Théoden had required, and only did so after\nGandalf left his own sword (also of high lineage) behind. Even so, he\nswore that death would come to anyone else who touched it (whether by\nhis own hand or by some magic, it is left unsaid).\n\nHe also appeared to possess a nigh-indomidable will. At one point, he\nwas able to psychically challenge Sauron for control of the Palantir of\nOrthanc, and proved victorious in that struggle. It should be noted that\neven Gandalf the White was reluctant to use the Palantir for fear of\nchallenging Sauron directly and revealing himself to the Dark Lord. He\nwas accounted as “the hardiest of living Men” during his lifetime.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _ARAGORN_ means “Revered King”, from the Sindarin _ara_\n(“king”) and _(n)gorn_ (“revered”).. Aragorn was named after Aragorn\nI.\n\nOther names\n\n-   ELESSAR - Aragorn's name as king (Quenya)\n-   EDHELHARN - Sindarin translation of Elessar\n-   ELFSTONE - Westron translation of Elessar\n-   ESTEL - Aragorn's nickname during his childhood in Rivendell. It\n    means “Hope”\n-   LONGSHANKS - Used by Samwise Gamgee and some of the Men of Bree\n-   STICK-AT-NAUGHT STRIDER - Used by the Men of Bree, particularly Bill\n    Ferny \n-   STRIDER - Used by the Men of Bree\n-   TELCONTAR - Quenya translation of Strider and the name of his House\n-   THORONGIL - Aragorn's alias during his travels to Rohan and Gondor.\n    It means “Eagle of the Star”\n-   WINGFOOT - Given by Éomer\n\nTitles\n\nAs king, Aragorn had many titles:\n\n-   THE DÚNADAN\n-   CHIEFTAIN OF THE DÚNEDAIN\n-   HEIR OF ISILDUR\n-   KING OF ALL THE DÚNEDAIN\n-   KING OF THE WEST\n-   LORD OF THE DÚNEDAIN\n-   ENVINYATAR - “the Renewer”\n-   KING OF GONDOR\n-   KING OF ARNOR\n-   HIGH KING OF GONDOR AND ARNOR\n-   LORD OF THE HOUSE OF TELCONTAR\n\n\nWeapons\n\n\n\nAs a Ranger, Aragorn was trained to be proficient with various weapons,\nsuch as bows, knives, spears and swords In battle he focused primarily\non his sword play, preferring close combat to a long scale fight. He was\na mighty warrior, and as such easily defeated many types of foes,\nranging from large groups of orcs to far more powerful foes such as\nTrolls and Ringwraiths, evident throughout various battles like Helm's\nDeep and the Morannon. In each case, Aragorn's finesse in battle has\nserved him greatly and earned him much recognition and respect from both\nthe Fellowship of the Ring and the people of Rohan and Gondor. He was\narguably the greatest swordsman of the Third Age, surpassing the likes\nof Faramir, Boromir and perhaps even Elrond.\n\nAragorn's sword is Andúril, Flame of the West, the reforged sword\nNarsil, Elendil's blade that Isildur used to cut the One Ring from\nSauron's hand. Aragorn uses it with the same skill the Numenoreans had\nlong ago.\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nThe restoration of the line of Elendil to the throne of Gondor is a\nsubplot of _The Lord of the Rings_; Aragorn's adventures not only aid\nFrodo in his Quest, but also bring him closer to his own kingship which,\nthough his by right and lineage, has been left open for centuries due to\nhistorical, legal, and military circumstances. The people of Gondor have\nbeen under the rule of the Stewards of Gondor for centuries, as it was\nwidely doubted that any of the royal line still lived. Shortly after\nIsildur's departure, Meneldil, son of Anárion, had severed Gondor from\nArnor politically, although the formal title of High King remained with\nthe northern line (as Isildur was Elendil's eldest son). This\narrangement had been reinforced by the Steward Pelendur in nearly 2,000\nyears before when he rejected Arvedui's claim to the Throne of Gondor\nduring a Gondorian succession crisis (Eärnil, a member of the House of\nAnárion, was eventually chosen as King instead). It is worth noting,\nhowever, that Arvedui had also based his claim on the fact that he had\nmarried a descendant of Anárion: thus, Aragorn was technically a\ndescendant of not only Elendil and Isildur but of Anárion as well.\n\n\nConcept and creation\n\nIdentity\n\nThe “first term” of the character that later evolved into Aragorn or\nStrider was a peculiar hobbit met by Bingo Bolger-Baggins (precursor of\nFrodo Baggins) at the inn of The Prancing Pony. His description and\nbehavior, however, was already quite close to the final story, with the\ndifference that the hobbit wore wooden shoes, and was nicknamed Trotter\nfor the “clitter-clap” sound that they produced. He was also accounted\nto be “one of the wild folk — rangers”, and he played the same role in\nFrodo's journey to Rivendell as in _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\nLater Tolkien hesitated about the true identity of “Trotter” for a long\ntime. One of his notes suggested that the Rangers should not be hobbits\nas originally planned, and that this would mean that Trotter was either\na Man, or a hobbit who associated himself with the Rangers and was “very\nwell known” (within the story). The latter suggestion was linked to an\nearly comment of Bingo: “I keep on feeling that I have seen him\nsomewhere before”. Tolkien made a proposal that Trotter might be Bilbo\nBaggins himself, but rejected that idea.\n\nAnother suggestion was that Trotter was “Fosco Took (Bilbo's first\ncousin), who vanished when a lad, owing to Gandalf”. This story was\nfurther elaborated, making Trotter a nephew of Bilbo, named Peregrin\nBoffin, and an elder cousin of Frodo. He was said to have run away after\nhe came of age, some twenty years before Bilbo's party, and had helped\nGandalf in tracking Gollum later. A hint was also given as to why\nTrotter wore wooden shoes: he had been captured by the Dark Lord in\nMordor and tortured, but saved by Gandalf; a note was added by Tolkien\nin the margin, saying that it would later be revealed that Trotter had\nwooden feet.\n\nThe conception of Trotter being a hobbit was discarded with the\nfollowing recommencing of writing; another short-lived idea was to make\nTrotter “a disguised elf − friend of Bilbo's in Rivendell”, and a scout\nfrom Rivendell who “pretends to be a ranger”.\n\nQuite soon Tolkien finally settled on the Mannish identity of Trotter,\nfrom the beginning introducing him as a “descendant of the ancient men\nof the North, and one of Elrond's household”, as well as the name\nAragorn. While the history of Númenor and the descendants of Elros and\nElendil were not fully developed, the terms of it were in existence, and\nwould come to be connected with The Lord of the Rings as the character\nof Aragorn developed. Thus the evolution of the history of the Second\nand Third Ages was dependent on the bringing of Trotter to association\nwith them.\n\nFurther character developments\n\nThe development of Aragorn's connection to Gondor was long and complex,\nas was his association with Boromir. Initially it is said that Aragorn's\nforefathers were the exiles of Númenor who ruled over the people of Ond\n(early name of Gondor), but were driven out by the Wizard King “when\nSauron raised a rebellion”. The story of the two branches of Elendil's\ndescendants ruling over two kingdoms of Men through many generations\nonly emerged gradually; at one time, Tolkien even seems to have\nconceived only three generations between Isildur and Aragorn.\n\nOne significant feature which was not established until late stages was\nAragorn's relationship with Arwen. When Tolkien first introduced Éowyn,\nthe interest which she showed towards Aragorn was not one-sided, with\nsuggestions in notes that they would marry at the end of the story.\nAnother proposal was done soon, that Éowyn would die to save or avenge\nThéoden, and Aragorn would never marry after her death.\n\nThe first mention of Elrond's daughter, named Arwen Undomiel, was in\nreference to the banner which she made for Aragorn, but Tolkien did not\ngive any hint whether she had any further part to play. The references\nto her marriage with Aragorn were made later, but it was explicitly\nstated only near the completion of the book. It is only in his working\non the appendices for The Lord of the Rings that Tolkien recorded the\nfull tale of Aragorn and Arwen.\n\nA passing idea was that Galadriel gave her Ring to Aragorn, and that he\nwould accordingly be titled the “Lord of the Ring”.\n\nRejected names\n\nThe original nickname TROTTER was retained for a long while, and Tolkien\ndecided to change it to Strider only after the story was completed.\nThere were also several experimental translations of Trotter to\nSindarin: Padathir, Du-finnion and Rimbedir, with Ecthelion possibly\nbeing equivalent to Peregrin (Boffin). Instead of the latter title “the\nDúnadan”, Quenya Tarkil (“Noble Man”) was first used, synonym with\nNúmenórean.\n\nTolkien hesitated for some time about Trotter's “real” name. Although\nAragorn was the first suggestion when the Mannish descent was settled,\nit was changed a number of times. At one point Tolkien decided that an\nElvish name does not suit a Man, and thus altered it from Aragorn via\nElfstone to Ingold, where the last one is an Old English name with ing-\nrepresenting “west”. Later, however, a new plot element was introduced:\nGaladriel's gift of a green stone, and Tolkien reverted the usage to\nElfstone in order to make an additional connection. This was retained\ninto the final version of the legendarium as a side name and a\ntranslation of Elessar.\n\nAmong other names to be used instead of Elfstone Tolkien considered\nElfstan, Elfmere, Elf-friend, Elfspear, Elfwold and Erkenbrand, with\nvarious Elvish forms: Eldamir, Eldavel, Eledon, and Qendemir. The name\nof Aragorn's father also passed through many transient forms: Tolkien\nintended Aramir or Celegorn to go in pair with Aragorn before settling\nupon Arathorn; Elfhelm and Eldakar with Elfstone and Eldamir; and Ingrim\nwith Ingold.\n\n\nHistory and Mythology\n\nRichard J. Finn presented a paper entitled “Arthur and Aragorn -\nArthurian Influence in LOTR at the Forty-First International Congress on\nMedieval Studies”. The are additional similarities between Aragorn and\nArthur beyond those pointed out by Finn. Arthur is descended from Kings\nof Goddodin - Coel Hen, Aragorn becomes King of Gondor. Kings of the\nperiod in Goddodin lived at both Traprain Law and Din Eidyn (Edinburgh,\nstill known as _Dùn Éideann_ in Scottish Gaelic) remarkably similar to\nDúnadan. For “Men of the North”, Goddodin was a far northern kingdom.\nArthur was crowned by St. Dubriticus, who wore a long gray robe for\nwhich he was called “His Grey Eminence” - Gandalf the White also wore a\ngray robe at Aragorn's coronation to indicate he at one time was Gandalf\nthe Grey.",

In his youth, the\nWitch-king of Angmar was at the height of its power and destroyed the\nNorthern Kingdom, overrunning its capital city Fornost. Most of the\nsurviving people, including Aranarth, fled to Lindon, but King Arvedui\nwent north to the Ice-Bay of Forochel. Aranarth urged Círdan to\nsend ships to rescue Arvedui, but this ship never returned. It was later\nlearned that the ship had sunk with Arvedui on board as well as the\nPalantiri of the north.\n\nBy right, this made Aranarth now King of Arnor, but since that was lost\nhe could not claim the title. Aranarth rode with the army of Gondor\nunder Eärnur and saw the destruction of Angmar. Aranarth's people became\nknown as the Rangers of the North (or Dúnedain), and he was the first of\ntheir Chieftains who dwelt in the wilds of in Eriador.

Aranarth's son Arahael was born\nin Rivendell, and was given a name with the Kingly prefix of _Ar(a)-_,\nto signify that by right he would be King of Arnor.\n\nArahael succeeded his father at his death in TA 2106.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Sindarin, _Aranarth_ means “Noble King”, from _aran_ (“king”) and\n_arth_ (“noble, exalted”).",

But\nafter two hundred years, the longing for the forests and wide lands\novercame her, and she asked leave to depart. Turgon was unwilling,\nfearing the exposure of the Hidden Kingdom, but eventually relented and\nallowed her to leave.\n\nRiding with companions Glorfindel, Ecthelion, and Egalmoth, they were\ndenied entrance to Doriath, it being closed to the Ñoldor. But they did\ntell her of the best way to find the Sons of Fëanor, and so they went\naround to the north, where she was separated in the dangerous region of\nNan Dungortheb and reported lost. However, she reached Himlad safely,\nand waited there to meet Celegorm who was abroad, but eventually she\nwandered out of boredom and became lost in the forest of Nan Elmoth.\n\n\n\nEöl the Dark Elf ruled those woods; seeing Aredhel and noticing her\nbeauty, he set enchantments about her so that she could not escape the\nforest. Eventually, she wandered to Eöl's dwelling in the woods, where\nhe finally revealed himself to her. After marrying him, she stayed with\nhim many years. They had a son named Maeglin, and telling him of her\nformer life and home, she desired to see them again, and left Nan Elmoth\nwith Maeglin while Eöl was away. They reached Gondolin (not realizing\nthat Eöl was following them all the while), and were received with\nrejoicing. Eöl was also discovered and brought before Turgon, but rather\nthan accept Turgon's judgment to remain, he attempted to kill his son\nfor disobeying him with a poisoned javelin concealed in his cloak.\nAredhel stepped in front of it and was hit by it and because of its\npoison, she died that night from the wound.\n\nEöl was cast down from the city walls and died, while Maeglin became\nmighty in Gondolin but later betrayed it to Morgoth.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHer name in Quenya was IRISSË. The names AREDHEL (“noble elf”) and\nAR-FEINIEL (“noble white lady”) were both originally intended to stand\nalone, and be used as the main name of Irissë.\n\nWhile preparing _The Silmarillion_ for publication Christopher Tolkien\ncould not discover which name was intended to be used as her final name,\nand he therefore chose to use both names: a decision he later stated in\n_The History of Middle-earth_ series was possibly mistaken.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nAredhel was tall and strong, fond of hunting and riding in the forests.\nHer skin was pale and her hair dark; she always wore silver and white.\nThough fond of the Sons of Fëanor, she never fell in love with any of\nthem.\n\n\nGallery",

While\nthe War in the South raged on, Arwen wove a banner for Aragorn, which\nwould become his standard after he became king.\n\n\n\nBefore taking the Paths of the Dead, Aragorn was met by a group\nconsisting of Dúnedain, and Arwen's brothers, Elladan and Elrohir. They\nbrought to him a banner of black cloth: a gift made by Arwen, and a sign\nthat encouraged him to take the difficult path. When the banner was\nunfurled at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields to reveal the emblem of\nElendil in Mithril, gems, and gold, it was the first triumphant\nannouncement of the King's return.\n====After the War==== \n\nArwen arrived at Minas Tirith after Aragorn had become King of Gondor\nand Arnor, and they married on Midsummer's Day in the year TA 3019,\nafter the end of the War of the Ring. She became Queen of the Reunited\nKingdoms of Arnor and Gondor. After marrying Aragorn, she bestowed upon\nFrodo Baggins a gift: Her place on the ships to Valinor. She bore\nAragorn's son, Eldarion, and several unnamed daughters, some time during\nthe Fourth Age.\n\nFourth Age\n\nIn the year 121 of the Fourth Age, after Aragorn's death, Arwen died of\na broken heart at Cerin Amroth in Lórien, and was buried there one\nyear after the death of Aragorn, to whom she had been wedded for 122\nyears. She was 2901 years old.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Arwen_ means “Noble Maiden”, from the Sindarin word _ar(a)_\n(“royal, noble”) and _wen_ (“maiden”). Her epessë UNDÓMIEL means\n“Evenstar”, from the Quenya _Undómë_ (“evening twilight”) and _el_\n(“star”).\n\n\nCharacter\n\nArwen was described to be the most beautiful of the last generation of\nHigh Elves in Middle-Earth, and was even said to bear a remarkable\nresemblance to her ancestress, Lúthien. Tolkien described Arwen as\nfollowing:\n\n_On Fellowship of the Ring's film version, Arwen proved wise. She proved\ncourage and kind as shown when she risked her own life and defied the\nNazgul to protect Frodo as well as acting to heal Frodo's wounds. She\nalso showed a great sense of humour when she traded barbs with Aragorn.\nShe also loved Aragorn so much she was ready to give up immortality so\nshe can be with him._\n\n\nLineage\n\nArwen was the youngest child of Elrond and Celebrían; her elder brothers\nwere the twins Elladan and Elrohir. Through her father, she was the\ngranddaughter of Eärendil the Mariner (the second of the Half-Elven),\ngreat-granddaughter of Tuor of Gondolin, and therefore a direct\ndescendant of the ancient House of Hador. Arwen was also a descendant of\nKing Turgon of the Ñoldor through her great-grandmother, Idril. Through\nher mother, she was the granddaughter of Lady Galadriel and the\ngreat-granddaughter of Finarfin. Éomer of Rohan said that the Lady Arwen\nwas more fair than the Lady Galadriel of Lórien, but Gimli son of Glóin\nthought differently. Through both of her parents Arwen was a direct\ndescendant of the ancient Elven House of Finwë. Furthermore, Arwen was a\ndescendant of Beren and Lúthien Tinúviel, whose story resembled hers.\nIndeed, Arwen was held to be the reappearance in likeness of her\nancestress Lúthien, fairest of all the Elves, who was called Nightingale\n(Tinúviel).\n\n\n\nArwen was a very distant relative of her husband Aragorn. Aragorn's\nancestor, Elros Tar-Minyatur, the first King of Númenor, was her father\nElrond's brother, who chose to live as a man rather than one of the\nEldar. This means that Aragorn also has very distant Elvish ancestry.\nElros died in SA 442, some 3240 years before Arwen was born.\n\nArwen eventually became Queen of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and\nGondor when she married Aragorn, who was of the line of the Kings of\nArnor.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring ended, Arwen and Aragorn produced the future\nheir of the throne, Eldarion.\n\nBy Arwen and Aragorn's marriage, the long-sundered lines of the\nHalf-elven were joined. Their union also served to unite and preserve\nthe bloodlines of the Three Kings of the High Elves (Ingwë, Finwë, and\nthe brothers Olwë and Elwë) as well as the only line with Maiarin blood\nthrough Arwen's great-great-great grandmother, Melian, Queen of Doriath,\nand also on Aragorn's side, through the line of kings of Arnor and\nNúmenor to Elros, Elrond's brother, whose great-great-grandmother was\nalso Melian.",

    "text": "FRODO BAGGINS, son of Drogo Baggins, was a Hobbit of the Shire during\nthe Third Age. He was, and still is, Tolkien's most renowned character\nfor his leading role in the Quest of the Ring, in which he bore the One\nRing to Mount Doom, where it was destroyed. He was a Ring-bearer, best\nfriend to his gardener, Samwise Gamgee, and one of the three Hobbits who\nsailed from Middle-earth to the Uttermost West at the end of the Third\nAge.\n\n\nBiography\n\nChildhood\n\nMuch of Frodo's youth was spent at Brandy Hall in Buckland, the\nancestral home of the Brandybuck family, including his mother (Primula\nBrandybuck). Frodo was known as something of a rascal, befriending\nMeriadoc (Merry) Brandybuck and Peregrin (Pippin) Took and causing\ntrouble wherever they went. They would often steal mushrooms from Farmer\nMaggot's farm Bamfurlong.  \n\nIn TA 2980, when Frodo was only 12 years old, his parents drowned in a\nboating accident on the Brandywine River. An only child, Frodo stayed in\nBrandy Hall until his 99-year-old “uncle” Bilbo adopted him in TA 2989.\nBilbo took Frodo to live with him in his home at Bag End and made him\nhis heir.\n\n\n\nThe two grew very close in the following years; Frodo learned much of\nthe Elvish language during his time with Bilbo, as well as much of the\nlore of Middle-earth. The two shared the same birthday, September 22 by\nShire Reckoning (around September 12–14 of our calendar), and a party\nof special magnificence was held at the beginning of The Fellowship of\nthe Ring when Frodo came of age of thirty-three and Bilbo hit the\npeculiar year of 111.\n\nBilbo gave a memorable Birthday Speech before playing a joke on his\nfellow hobbits by using the One Ring to disappear, at which Gandalf\nquickly reacted and used his staff to create a blinding flash where\nBilbo had been standing. The hobbits at the Party were left confused and\ndisgruntled, and Bilbo was never again seen in the Shire.\n\nBefore departing for his journey to Rivendell, Bilbo had a long\nconversation with Gandalf, who finally persuaded him to voluntarily\nsurrender the One Ring. Bilbo left it on the fireplace mantel with a\nnote for Frodo, who would now become the next Ring-bearer.\n\nComing of Age and Quest Beginning\n\n\n\nAfter the party finished, Frodo returned home and discovered that he was\nnow the master of Bag End and the recipient of Bilbo's magic ring.\nGandalf, ever more curious about the ring's origin, power, and purpose\n(but not yet positive it was the One Ring), advised the young hobbit\nagainst the using the ring. For the next seventeen years, Frodo complied\nwith the wizard's request and hid the Ring in a safe place. However, on\nApril 12, 3018, Gandalf returned to Bag End and warned Frodo that the\nRing was actually the One Ring, which the evil lord Sauron needed to\nrule over Middle-earth. Realizing that Sauron would be looking for the\nRing, Gandalf advised the Hobbit to secretly follow Bilbo's journey to\nRivendell.\n\nAfter Frodo's discussion with Gandalf, a rumor started that he was\nrunning out of money. This rumor, although not begun by Frodo, was\nencouraged by him. Merry helped Frodo to purchase a small house at\nCrickhollow. With the exception of his gardener Sam Gamgee, who had\nagreed to accompany him to Rivendell, Frodo told the other Hobbits of\nthe Shire that he intended to move to Buckland. He sold his home to the\nSackville-Baggins, and, on the September 23, 3018, the day after his\nfiftieth birthday, Frodo left from Bag End, taking with him Sam and\nPippin. They left in the early morning for Bree, and just in time, as\nSauron's most powerful servants, the nine Nazgûl, had entered the Shire\ndressed as Black riders searching for a hobbit with the name of Baggins.\n\nTo Bree\n\nFrodo was unable to find much information about his pursuers from his\nconversations with the High Elves and Farmer Maggot, but what they were\ntold was less than encouraging. When Frodo arrived at Buckland, where\nMerry was waiting, he found that Merry and Pippin already knew about\nFrodo's “secret” journey. Frodo was left with no alternative but to\nbring the two youngsters with him. They cut through the Old Forest and\nthe Barrow-downs in hopes of losing the Black Riders, which did succeed.\nThey met other troubles in those places though, at the hands of Old Man\nWillow and the Barrow-Wights, but were rescued twice by Tom Bombadil, a\nmysterious being who dwelled in a glade in the middle of the Old Forest.\n\nStrider\n\n\n\nIn Bree, the hobbits stayed at The Prancing Pony, an old inn. Frodo went\nby the name of Mr. Underhill, attempting to raise as little suspicion as\npossible. When he noticed a mysteriously cloaked Man sitting in the\nshadows and smoking a long-stemmed pipe, Frodo asked the innkeeper,\nBarliman Butterbur, who the man was. The innkeeper referred to the man,\na Ranger, as Strider.\n\nThat night, black riders arrived in Bree and attacked the inn in search\nof Frodo and the One Ring, but Strider had managed to hide the Hobbits\nfrom them in time. Having gained their trust, Strider introduced himself\nas Aragorn to Frodo and the others, to whom he also revealed the\nbackstory of the black riders, also called Nazgûl or Ringwraiths. With a\npony named Bill that the Hobbits had acquired at Bree, Strider led Frodo\nand his companions into the Wild. Aragorn would be their guide to\nRivendell, and he would lead them through the Midgewater Marshes and to\nthe top of Weathertop.\n\nWeathertop\n\n\n\nOn the night of October the sixth, the Hobbits were attacked by five of\nthe nine Ringwraiths at the hill of Weathertop. In the presence of the\nNazgûl, Frodo made the mistake of putting on the Ring. He was able to\nresist their attempt to take him by drawing his sword and invoking the\nname of one of the Valar, Elbereth Gilthoniel. Unfortunately, the leader\nof the Nazgûl, the Witch-king of Angmar, stabbed Frodo in the shoulder\n(he would have stabbed his heart) with a Morgul-blade. If it had caught\nhim in the heart, Frodo would have become like the Nazgûl, only weaker\nand under their control. The Ringwraiths were driven away by the\nappearance of Aragorn and his martial skill; also because he had\ntorches, one of their few weaknesses.\n\nThough Aragorn was a skilled healer, he could not heal Frodo's wound. A\nfragment of the Ringwraith's blade remained in Frodo's flesh, where it\ncontinued to move towards his heart. Near death (or worse), Frodo was\nrescued by Glorfindel, an Elf-lord, who put the injured Hobbit upon his\nhorse, named Asfaloth. They were pursued by the Nazgûl as Asfaloth\ncarried Frodo to the Ford of Bruinen, at the entrance to the valley of\nRivendell. Once they had crossed the River Bruinen, Frodo turned and saw\nthe Nine Ringwraiths on the other side. They ordered him to give up the\nRing, but Frodo refused.\n\n\n\nSubsequently, the Ringwraiths were washed away in a flood called up by\nElrond, the leader of Rivendell. He was healed in Rivendell by Elrond,\nalthough both of them knew that the wound would never fully heal, as it\nwas as spiritual as it was physical. On the 24th of October 3018, Frodo\nawoke in Rivendell and was reunited with Bilbo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Sam,\nMerry, and Pippin. Although Elrond had healed his wound, it continued to\nbother him for as long as he lived in Middle-earth.\n\nQuest of the Ring\n\nCouncil of Elrond\n\n\n\nAfter his healing, Frodo was summoned to a great Council that Elrond had\norganized. Representatives of all the Free Peoples of Middle-earth\ndiscussed the history of the Rings of Power and decided that the One\nRing must be destroyed. As the ring was shown and tempers flared,\nargument broke out as to who should carry the Ring on this mission,\nuntil Frodo bravely volunteered to take the Ring to Mordor and cast it\ninto the fires of Mount Doom. A member of each of the Free Peoples\noffered to join Frodo in his quest, thus forming the Fellowship of the\nRing.\n\nThe Fellowship consisted of Frodo, Samwise, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn,\nGandalf, Boromir of Gondor, Legolas of the Woodland Realm, and Gimli of\nthe Dwarves. Before leaving Rivendell, Bilbo gave Frodo his dwarf-made\ncoat of mithril mail and his elven blade Sting. The mithril coat had\nbeen given to Bilbo by Thorin after the events of _The Hobbit,_ and\nSting had been taken by Bilbo from the den of a troll. On December 25,\nthe Fellowship of the Ring departed from Rivendell and headed south.\n\nMoria\n\n\n\nOn January 11, 3019, the Fellowship attempted to cross the Misty\nMountains (specifically the Pass of Caradhras), but were unable to due\nto a snowstorm. They instead traveled through the underground city of\nMoria at the urging of Gimli. \n\nMoria (also named Khazad-dum), was the most ancient and grand of Dwarven\ncities, but was deserted when the dwarves uncovered a Balrog, known only\nas Durin's Bane, beneath the city, and had been defeated by legions of\ngoblins. When they entered the Chamber of Mazarbul, the Fellowship was\nattacked by Orcs and a cave-troll. Frodo helped to defeat the troll\nbefore he was stabbed by an orc captain, his mithril shirt saving him\nfrom a deadly blow. The Fellowship ran through Moria to the Bridge of\nKhazad-dum, where Gandalf fell while confronting Durin's Bane. Once\noutside Moria, while the Fellowship was grieving, Gimli took Frodo and\nSam to look upon the Mirrormere, even in their great hurry.\n\nLothlórien\n\n\n\nDeeply grieved by their loss, the Fellowship journeyed to the Elven\nkingdom of Lothlórien, where they met the Lady Galadriel and Lord\nCeleborn. Galadriel showed Frodo a vision of the future in her Mirror.\nFrodo offered her the One Ring, but she resisted the temptation to take\nit, passing the test that was laid before her, and accepting the\ndiminishing of the power of the elves. Before the Fellowship departed\nfrom Lothlórien, Galadriel gave each member a gift. To Frodo, she gave a\nphial with the light of the star Eärendil captured inside; this gift\nwould prove hugely important later on in the quest. They were also\nprovided with elven way-bread, other supplies, and ships for their\nvoyage down the Anduin River.\n\nThe Breaking of the Fellowship\n\n\n\nThe Fellowship continued their journey south to Amon Hen. There,\nBoromir, a Man of Gondor and a member of the Fellowship, attempted to\nconvince Frodo to bring the Ring to Minas Tirith and regroup from there.\nWhen the hobbit asked for an hour alone to consider his options, Boromir\nfollowed him. Seeing that Frodo did not intend to take the suggested\ncourse of action, Boromir tried to take the Ring from him by force.\n\nFrodo put on the Ring and escaped to the Seat of Seeing, where he\nwatched as war brewed across Middle-Earth and the Eye of Sauron\nsearching for him as he traveled.\n\n\n\nTaking off the Ring, he decided to take the item to Mordor alone,\nwithout telling the other members of the Fellowship. However, he was\njoined by his friend Samwise Gamgee, who felt it was necessary that he\nshould protect and guide Frodo. Frodo gave in to Sam's protests, and\nalthough reluctant to lead anyone else to his fate, was glad to have\nSam's company.\n\nThe two hobbits continued toward Mordor, dividing the Fellowship. Here\nBoromir was killed by uruk-archers while defending Merry and Pippin; the\ntwo young hobbits were then captured by Uruk-hai, and were to be taken\nto Isengard. Instead of following Samwise and Frodo to Mordor, the Three\nHunters decided it more important to rescue Merry and Pippin from their\ncaptors. The breaking of the Fellowship was now complete.\n\nEmyn Muil\n\nAfter leaving what remained of the Fellowship at Amon Hen, Frodo and Sam\ntried to navigate through the winding paths of the Emyn Muil. After\ngetting lost several times, they were found by Gollum, who at first\ntried to take the One Ring, but was captured by Sam (with Frodo's help)\nand tied up with the Elven rope. Frodo, now pitying the creature,\ndecided not to slay Gollum, but forced him to swear an oath of servitude\nto the master of the precious. Gollum then led them out of the maze and\ninto the Dead Marshes.\n\nThe Dead Marshes\n\n\n\nThe Dead Marshes followed the razor-sharp rocks of Emyn Muil, and were\njust as disorienting, if not more so. There was thought to be no route\nthrough the marshes, as orcs marched for miles around, although Gollum\nhad secretly discovered a path when out on one of his many errands. He\nled Frodo and Sam on a safe pathway through the marshes, warning them\nnot to follow what seemed like small torches in the water.\n\nIthilien\n\nGollum led the two Hobbits to the Black Gate of Mordor, as Frodo had\ndesired, but stopped the Hobbits from passing its doors, as the danger\nwas too great. He then explained about a secret way into Mordor, 'Up the\nstairs and through the tunnel'. The Hobbits once again found themselves\nbeing led by Gollum. After venturing into Ithilien, and witnessing a\nskirmish between a company of warriors from Haradrim (along with\nOliphaunts) and rangers from Gondor, they were apprehended by the\nranger's captain, Faramir. When the skirmish had ended, Faramir\nblindfolded the ring-bearer and his companions and led them to Henneth\nAnnûn, the Window on the West. Upon much interrogation, Samwise\nfoolishly misspoke, and gave away that Frodo was indeed carrying the One\nRing. Realizing the importance of the quest, Faramir proved his quality,\nunlike his brother, Boromir, and let the ring-bearer go free. Later,\nGollum was captured in the Forbidden Pool and forcibly taken into the\nhidden lair. Frodo begged for his safety, and he was not killed,\nalthough the rift between master and servant had once again begun to\nopen.\n\nMinas Morgul and Shelob's Lair\n\n\n\nGollum led the Hobbits past the lair of the Witch-King of Angmar, Minas\nMorgul, and up the stairs into 'The Tunnel'. When they arrived at the\ntop though, they were abandoned by Gollum. They cautiously travelled\nthrough the tunnel, and managed to get to the end only to find their way\nbarred by Shelob's great web. Whilst attempting to cut through the\nwebbing, Frodo bravely stood up to Shelob and forced her back further\ninto the tunnels giving him and Sam time enough to hack through the\nthreads and escape. Upon escaping the tunnels, Frodo thought himself\nsafe; however, Shelob, through one of her many tunnels, managed to sneak\nout and jab him with her stinger. As he was being encased in Shelob's\nwebbing, Samwise was able to draw her into single combat wherein he,\nusing Sting and the Phial of Galadriel, was able to mortally wound her\nand drive her back into her caves. Sam took the Ring from around Frodo's\nneck upon hearing Orcish voices, and hid behind some nearby rocks. He\noverheard the orcs speaking of Frodo, and Sam realized that his master\nwas not dead, but merely paralyzed. Frodo was then taken to the tower of\nCirith Ungol to await further torture and questioning.\n\nCirith Ungol\n\nFrodo was taken to the utmost top of Cirith Ungol and imprisoned.  He\nwas stripped of all his clothes and all the things he carried.\nSquabbling over his mithril vest, fighting broke out amongst the two\nlead orcs and their battalions, killing almost all the orcs and Uruk-hai\nin the tower. Sam arrived at the gate of Cirith Ungol, only to find his\nway blocked by the Two Watchers; he eventually overcame them, journeyed\nto the tower where Frodo was held, and rescued his master. They fled the\ntower, having to pass the Watchers again (although this time destroying\nthem), and entered Mordor.\n\nMordor and Mount Doom\n\nFrodo and Sam crawled onward through the empty plains of Mordor, as the\nOrcs had been sent to the Black Gate to stop the Men of the West's army,\nand, after falling in and out of a company of Orcs, started to climb\nMount Doom. They journeyed on for many days with hardly any food or\nwater, and Frodo became progressively weaker as the Ring's power over\nhim grew the closer they came to Orodruin. Frodo was eventually unable\nto go on, and Sam was forced to carry him a fair distance while his\nmaster rested upon his back. It was then that Gollum decided to\nreappear, and after a brief struggle, Sam cut Gollum in the stomach, and\nFrodo fled up the mountain.\n\n \n\nInside the Crack of Doom, Frodo finally had the chance to destroy the\nring, and rid himself of his burden, but the power of the ring was at\nits strongest, due to the proximity of the cracks. It was here that\nFrodo finally yielded to the temptation and power of the ring. Sam\nyelled for Frodo to destroy the Ring, but Frodo was overcome by its\npower and claimed the Ring for himself. Gollum attacked Sam, who fell\nand hit his head on a rock, temporarily knocking him unconscious. When\nhe came to he saw Gollum fighting with an unseen foe (Frodo, having put\non the Ring). Then Gollum bit off Frodo's finger, Ring and all, and was\nreunited with his treasure for a short time, until dancing with joy he\ntoppled off the brink and fell into the depths, destroying himself and\nthe One Ring.\n\nThe two hobbits tried to escape as the volcano erupted. Just as it\nlooked as though they were doomed, Gwaihir the Lord of Eagles saw them,\nand with his Eagle companions Landroval and Meneldor rescued Sam and\nFrodo and flew them to safety.\n\nThe End of the War and the Departure of Frodo\n\nThe Scouring of the Shire\n\n\n\nAfter recovering in Minas Tirith, and witnessing the coronation of King\nAragorn, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin all returned to the Shire. When\nthey arrived though, they found it under the control of a man named\nSharkey (later revealed to be Saruman) and his forces. Saruman was\nruling the Shire from Bag End, although he was later murdered by Grima\nWormtongue. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin however, started to gather all\nthe Shirriffs and townsfolk in the Shire, and they successfully defeated\nthe Ruffians employed by Sharkey at the Battle of Bywater.\n\n\n\nFrodo wasn't directly involved in the fighting at the Battle of Bywater;\ninstead, he made sure that no Hobbits were harmed (saying that no Hobbit\nhad ever intentionally harmed another in the Shire and that it was not\ngoing to begin there), and also that any ruffians that surrendered were\nnot harmed.\n\nThe Fourth Age\n\n\n\nFrodo briefly served as Deputy Mayor of the Shire, but soon realized\nthat he still bore the wounds of his quest, and so retired. He was also\nin continual pain from his shoulder wound, which pained him each\nanniversary of their stay on Weathertop. On 22 September SR 1421 (Fourth\nAge), at the age of 53, Frodo joined Bilbo, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel,\nand Círdan aboard an Elven ship. He was allowed passage across the sea\nto the Undying Lands, as he was a ring-bearer, with the hope of healing\nthe damage to his spirit that bearing the Ring had caused. Sometime\nafter the year 61 in the Fourth Age, fellow ring-bearer and best friend\nSamwise Gamgee, reunited with Frodo in the undying lands where it was\npresumed they lived out the remainder of their days.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nFrodo, as described by Gandalf, was “taller than some and fairer than\nmost, (with) a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye.” (_The\nFellowship of the Ring_, Chapter 10, “Strider”)'' ''He was a shy, young\nhobbit with thick, curly brown hair like most other hobbits, and had\nlighter-than-usual skin due to his Fallohide ancestry through his\nBrandybuck mother. He could be described as fairly good looking for a\nhobbit. Frodo is described as appearing thirty-three, even when he is\nfifty, due to the influence of the Ring. Bilbo and Frodo shared a common\nbirthday on September 22, but Bilbo was 78 years Frodo's senior. At the\nopening of _The Fellowship of the Ring_, Frodo and Bilbo were\ncelebrating their thirty-third and eleventy-first (111th) birthdays,\nrespectively. Frodo, like Bilbo, was considered by many others in\nHobbiton to be a little odd. His curiosity of the outside world,\nfascination with Elves and faraway places (like those to which Bilbo\ntravelled in _The Hobbit_) did not fit the general content personality\nof most Hobbits. This curiosity was also attributed to his Took\nancestry. He was very kind and compassionate, pitying Gollum and\nallowing him to guide him and Sam to Mordor despite Sam's distrust of\nthe creature. This act of kindness later proved to be a factor in the\nquest's success in destroying the Ring. The influence of the Ring and\nthe wound by the Morgul-Blade seems combined to have given him the\nability to see into the spirit world, for instance he sees faraway\nevents in his dreams on several occasions. He also can see the ring of\npower worn by Galadriel and he seems to be able to sense danger.\n\n\nWeapons and Attire\n\nFrodo was dressed in typical Hobbit-fashion when he left the Shire: knee\nbreeches, shirt, waistcoat, jacket, and cloak. Colors such as bright\ngreen and yellow were typical for Shire-folk. He was unarmed, save for a\npocketknife.\n\nWhen his little group was waylaid by Barrow-wights, he lost his\nsummer-weight clothing and was wearing a burial shrift when rescued by\nTom Bombadil. When their pack-ponies returned, he was forced to put on\nheavier woollen clothing intended for colder weather. The Hobbits found\nseveral long Dúnedain daggers in the wight's treasure. These served as\nshort-swords for the Hobbits, but Frodo's was broken when he resisted\nthe Witch-king at Weathertop. At Imladris, he removed his Hobbit\nclothing upon finding new Elven clothes that fitted him perfectly.\nTherefore, throughout his quest, he wore a green silk tunic, trousers\ntogether with cloaks made of fur for the first stages of the quest, and\nthen towards Mordor he shed them to wear his tunic and trousers in the\nwarmer weather. Later, his Uncle Bilbo gave him both Sting, a magic\nElven dagger, and a coat of mithril chain mail. The mail saved his life\ntwice, first when it deflected a spear-point in the Mines of Moria, and\nsecond when it turned aside the dagger that Saruman used to try and kill\nhim.\n\nAs with the other members of the Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo received\na special cloak from Galadriel in Lórien, which allowed him to blend in\nwith natural surroundings. Upon being betrayed by Gollum and captured by\nOrcs at Cirith Ungol, Frodo lost all of his clothing and most of his\npossessions. Sam Gamgee saved Sting, however. After the two tribes of\norcs had slain each other in the tower of Cirith Ungol, Frodo dressed\nhimself in Orc-garb. This successfully fooled the Mordor-Orcs they\nencountered, but he dropped the Orc mail and helmet as he and Sam\napproached Mount Doom.\n\nCombat\n\nSword\n\nFrodo used Bilbo's famed short sword Sting for melee combat, it was also\nput to great use as it warns him of nearby orcs and goblins by glowing\nblue.",

    "text": "BALIN was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of\nDwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II\nOakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.\n\nA Dwarf Lord, Balin was old and wise, he was one of Thorin's closest\nfriends and advisors, and was always willing to listen and offer wise\ncounsel. Balin is distantly related to Thorin, and is a descendant of\nthe noble house of Durin.\n\nHe later went to reestablish the kingdom of Dwarves, Moria, but in five\nyears it was reovercome by Orcs, and he was killed there.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\nBalin was a Dwarf, son of Fundin, and likely born in the Lonely Mountain\nbefore the coming of Smaug the Dragon. He had a younger brother named\nDwalin and was one of those driven from their homes when the dragon\nSmaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards he may have lived in\nDunland as a refugee. He fought in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. Many\nyears later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the\nfather of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain\nhimself, but Thráin was captured and lost.\n\nThe Quest of Erebor\n\n\n\nBalin was part of the company assembled by Thorin Oakenshield that\njourneys to the Lonely Mountain with Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf to defeat\nSmaug and retake the mountain kingdom of Erebor. He was the second Dwarf\nto arrive at Bilbo's house, where like his brother Dwalin he played a\nviol as big as himself. Among the Dwarves of the company, Balin was the\nsecond-eldest dwarf on the quest, and loosely, held the position of\ndeputy leader. He led the Dwarves in their escape from the spiders and,\nwhen Thorin was absent, spoke for the party when the Elven King\nThranduil captured them.\n\nHe is described as “always their look-out man”: He spots Bilbo\napproaching The Green Dragon Inn at Bywater, he spots the trolls' fire,\nand he's the first to spot the Elves in Mirkwood. He noted that not even\na mouse had ever passed him on watch, and wondered why he did not notice\nBilbo (hidden by wearing the magic ring) when he was lookout for the\ncompany after escaping the Orcs in the Misty Mountains.\n\nBalin gained respect for Bilbo's abilities, and was the only dwarf who\nvolunteered to accompany Bilbo down the secret passage to Smaug's\nchamber. Of all the Dwarves in the quest, Balin was the only one known\nto have visited Bilbo at Bag End after their experiences on the quest\nfor the Lonely Mountain.\n\nExpedition and Death\n\n\n\nBalin later led an expedition in an attempt to reclaim the ancient dwarf\nkingdom of Moria, hoping to regain both the wealth of Moria and the last\nof the Seven Rings of the Dwarves. Ultimately, the search for the\nring—which conferred great wealth and a curse of greed on its owners—was\nin vain, as it had been recaptured from Thráin II by Sauron. Balin\nhimself was killed by an Orc during his quest to re-establish the\ndwarven kingdom of Moria.",

    "text": "BARAHIR was an Edain Man of Dorthonion during the First Age, heir to the\nHouse of Bëor, youngest son and last child of Bregor, the fifth\nchieftain of the People of Bëor, and husband of Emeldir who was also of\nthe House of Bëor through the line of Belen, the youngest son of Bëor.\nBarahir was most famous for being the father of the renowned Beren\nErchamion. He was also the fourth Lord of Ladros and the seventh and\nprobably last Chieftain of the Bëorians after his deceased elder brother\nBregolas. Besides his elder brother, Barahir had three elder\nsisters: _Bregil_, _Hirwen_, and _Gilwen_.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarlier, Barahir had fought at the Dagor Bragollach, saving Finrod\nFelagund's life earning him and his house the friendship of the House of\nFinarfin. For this, he received “Barahir's Ring”, which was then handed\ndown the family line. After the Dagor Bragollach by FA 456, Barahir\nlived with twelve companions on the highland of Dorthonion at Tarn\nAeluin as outlaws defying the will of Morgoth whose forces hunted him\nand his company like wild beasts. The members of Barahir's outlaw\nband was his son Beren, his nephews Baragund the elder and Belegund the\nyounger, Radhruin and Dairuin, Dagnir and Ragnor, Gildor and Gorlim _the\nUnhappy_, Arthad, and Urthel, and Hathaldir _the Young_. As for his wife\nEmeldir, she parted from Barahir when she became the leader of the women\nand children of Bëor's folk that fled Dorthonion. For her bravery in\nthis, Barahir's wife was known as _Emeldir the Man-hearted_,\n\nFor five years, Barahir led his doomed band of outlaws until FA 460 when\nthey were betrayed to Sauron by Gorlim, a lovesick member of Barahir's\noutlaw band and Barahir was killed at Tarn Aeluin along with everyone in\nhis company save for Beren his son who was gone on an errand for them\nand thus luckily happened to be not there. Barahir's remains were buried\nin a cairn by his son at Tarn Aeluin save for his hand which was chopped\noff by an Orc captain of Morgoth. Beren later slew that Orc-captain and\nrecovered the renowned Ring of Barahir. Barahir's son then escaped\nDorthonion after all and lived on to fulfill a great destiny.\n\nLegacy\n\nBarahir's service to Finrod and House of Finarfin left behind a legacy\nof respect between the House of Bëor, later generations of Men, and\nElves. This friendship led to the close association of the elves and the\nDúnedain of Númenor and Arnor and Gondor. His ring also became an\nheirloom of the Dúnedain of the North of Middle-earth.\n\n\nLater namesakes\n\nBarahir was also the name of the eighth Steward of Gondor and was also\nthe name of the grandson of Faramir and Éowyn in the Fourth Age, who\nwrote _The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen_.\n\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nThe character of Barahir evolved out of the character Egnor bo-Rimion\n(see _The Book of Lost Tales_ and _Beren and Lúthien_ novel). In the\noriginal Barahir was originally a Gnome, an Elf. The Tale of Tinúviel\nsaw a 1925 (and later) edit that changed Egnor into Barahir a Noldoli\nElf. At some point the character evolved into a Man. However, its noted\nin _'Beren and Luthien_ that the in the original pre-1917 transcript\nwhich J.R.R. Tolkien erased and wrote over that Beren was originally a\nMan, before he rewrote the character as an Elf, and would go back to\nmaking him a Man in _Lay of Leithian_ (though the narrative included in\nthe new novel has Beren switching between both races depending on the\nsection documents).",

    "text": "BARD, known also as BARD THE BOWMAN, and less chiefly, BARD THE FIRST,\nwas a man of Laketown, the slayer of the dragon Smaug, and the founder\nand first king of the new Kingdom of Dale. He was succeeded as King of\nDale by his son, Bain.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nBard was descended from Lord Girion of Dale, whose wife and child had\nescaped to Laketown when Smaug ruined Dale and took the Lonely Mountain\nin TA 2770.\n\nIn TA 2941, when Smaug emerged from the Lonely Mountain and attacked\nLaketown, Bard, as captain of a company of town archers, was encouraging\nthe archers and urging the town Master to order them to fight to the\nlast arrow. Bard himself fired many arrows with his great yew bow. He\nwas down to his last arrow when a thrush came and perched on his\nshoulder. Because Bard was of the race of Dale, he was able to\nunderstand the thrush's words. The bird told him of the weak spot in\nSmaug's armor that Bilbo Baggins had discovered. Bard fired his Black\nArrow and struck the hollow by Smaug's left breast and the dragon fell\nfrom the sky, landing on Laketown and destroying it.\n\nBard escaped into the lake and swam ashore. The people wanted him to be\ntheir King, but he said he would continue to serve the Master of\nLaketown for the time being. Bard took charge of organizing shelter and\naid for the refugees and sent messages to the Elvenking of Mirkwood\nasking for help. Then, Bard and the Elvenking led their armies to the\nLonely Mountain, seeking a share of the treasure.\n\nWhen they arrived at the Lonely Mountain, they were surprised to find\nThorin Oakenshield and his company of Dwarves still alive. Bard sought\nreparations from Thorin on the grounds that it was he who had slain\nSmaug, that part of the Dragon’s treasure had once belonged to Dale, and\nthat the people of Laketown were suffering and needed aid. Thorin said\nthat the destruction of Laketown was not his responsibility and he\nrefused to parley with armies camped outside the mountain. Bard sent a\nmessenger several hours later asking for one-twelfth of the treasure,\nbut again Thorin refused.\n\n\n\nBilbo Baggins thought that Bard's claims were reasonable, so one night\nhe went secretly to the camp of the Lakemen and Elves. The Hobbit had\nfound the Arkenstone - the treasure that Thorin most desired - and he\noffered it to Bard and Thranduil to use to negotiate. He also told them\nthat an army of 500 Dwarves led by Dain II Ironfoot was coming from the\nIron Hills.\n\nThe next day, Bard asked Thorin for a portion of the treasure in\nexchange for the Arkenstone. Thorin was enraged, but he reluctantly\nagreed to give up Bilbo's one-fourteenth share. Dain's army arrived the\nnext day, and Bard tried to prevent them from entering the Lonely\nMountain until the exchange for the Arkenstone had been made. A battle\nseemed imminent, but then Gandalf told them that an army of Goblins and\nWargs were approaching. Bard, Thranduil, and Dain took council together\nand they joined forces to fight their common enemy in the Battle of the\nFive Armies. During the battle, Thorin had emerged from the mountain and\nhad rallied Dwarves, Elves, and Men to the attack, but he was mortally\nwounded. Bard laid the Arkenstone upon Thorin's breast when he was\nburied under the mountain, and Dain agreed to pay the one-fourteenth\nshare of the treasure as promised. Bard gave the emeralds of Girion to\nThranduil and Bilbo agreed to take a small chest of gold and one of\nsilver. Bard also contributed gold for the aid of Laketown, and although\nthe Master of Laketown absconded with much of it, Laketown was rebuilt\nand its people became prosperous.\n\nBard went to his ancestral home of Dale at the foot of the Lonely\nMountain. He rebuilt the ruined town and in TA 2944, he became King of\nDale. Bard maintained good relations with the Dwarves of the Lonely\nMountain and trade flowed freely up and down the River Running. People\ncame to settle in Dale from miles around and the land that had been\nwithered by Smaug became bountiful once more.\n\nBard died in TA 2977. His son Bain succeeded him as King of Dale.",

They\nguarded the Ford of Carrock from the Goblins and Wargs.\n\n\nBiography\n\nThird Age\n\nBeorn was a warrior with great strength who could turn into a great\nblack bear. In human form, he appeared as a, tall, black-haired man with\nhuge arms and a great beard. Beorn kept many animals at his residence,\nsuch as horses, dogs and sheep. His animals were all extremely\nintelligent; his dogs, for instance, could walk on their hind legs while\ncarrying things with their forelegs, set the table, and able to speak.\nBeorn's horses could also understand what their master said. Beorn was\nalso capable of speaking in the tongue of beasts, as he could\ncommunicate with bears. When he spoke to his dogs, his words sounded\nlike “barks twisted into some form of speech”.\n\nThe Quest of Erebor\n\n\n\nIn the years following the Battle of Five Armies, Beorn became a great\nchieftain among the folk of the Anduin Vales and his followers became\nknown as the Beornings. At some point he took a wife and sired a son,\nGrimbeorn, later known as Grimbeorn the Old. Before the War of the Ring,\nBeorn passed away, and his son Grimbeorn eventually took over his\nduties as chieftain. \n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _BEORN_ originates from an Old English term that means\n“warrior” . It is a cognate to the Old Norse _bjǫrn_ which means\n“bear”.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nDespite being incredibly powerful, Beorn respects all life forms, with\nthe absolute exception of Goblins and Wargs. He has a magic-like effect\non his animals, who seemed to be more intelligent and strong than other\nanimals. He keeps bee pastures and spends his nights patrolling the\nwoods and mountains in the form of a bear. He is wise, mysterious and\npowerful, possessing incredible strength and durability. He is fairly\ndecent, as he allows Thorin and Company to stay at his home for a short\nwhile and even offers them sanctuary from the Goblins. He is also\nvengeful. When Thorin is fatally wounded, he storms the Goblin ranks,\nrescues Thorin and then returns, destroying the Goblins and killing Bolg\nhimself.",

    "text": "BEREN, also called BEREN ERCHAMION, was a man of Middle-earth, and a\nhero whose romance with the Elf Lúthien was one of the great stories of\nthe Elder Days that were told for many ages after he lived.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nEarly life in Dorthonion\n\nBeren was an Edain (a man), the son of Barahir and Emeldir the\nman-hearted. He was a man of the royal House of Bëor of Dorthonion, and\nthe most accomplished hero and adventurer of the First Age. The battle\nof the Dagor Bragollach befell during his youth, bringing about the ruin\nof his kingdom. The young Beren lived with his father and eleven loyal\nfollowers in the highlands of Dorthonion, and the thirteen of them\nperformed many acts of bravery, to the great frustration of Morgoth, the\nDark King of Angband. After the ruin of the Outlaws of Dorthonion and\nthe death of his father, Beren lived alone in Dorthonion off the land\nand came to know the many birds and beasts that lived there, and they\nhelped him when he needed it. During this time, he hunted nothing and\nate no meat and only killed the creatures of Morgoth that roamed the\ncountry. He learned not to fear death only captivity and bondage;\nhowever, things began to grow more difficult for him in Dorthonion for\nMorgoth put an even greater price on his head and he was forced from the\nland of his birth by Sauron and Draugluin. He crossed into Doriath,\nthrough the forests of Dungortheb, where he saw and fell in love with\nLúthien, princess of the Sindar and daughter of Thingol and Melian.\n\nThe Quest for the Silmaril\n\n Thingol\nhaughtily refused to give Lúthien's hand in marriage. He said that he\nwould allow the marriage to take place only if Beren brought back a\nSilmaril from the Iron Crown of Morgoth. The task was intended to be\nimpossible, but Beren and Lúthien, with the aid of Finrod of Nargothrond\nand Huan the Great Hound (both of whom died protecting Beren), braved\nmany perils (even besting Sauron, then Morgoth's most powerful\nlieutenant) and captured a Silmaril. However, as they escaped from\nAngband, the great wolf Carcharoth, whom Morgoth had personally bred,\nawoke. Beren held out the Silmaril, hoping that its radiance would avert\nthe beast, but he was mistaken. Carcharoth bit off his hand swallowed it\nand the Silmaril (thus Beren was called ERCHAMION, One-hand), and\nproceeded to run rampant through Doriath. Lúthien and the unconscious\nBeren were rescued by the Eagles of Manwë. When he presented himself to\nThingol, he demonstrated to him that he had obtained, then lost the\nSilmaril at the cost of one of his hands; he was then given the name\nCAMLOST, Empty-handed. Beren participated in the hunting of Carcharoth,\nwhere the beast was slain and the Silmaril recovered; the quest was\naccomplished, but in the process Beren was mortally wounded.\n\nSecond life\n\n\n\nLúthien's love for Beren was so strong that, upon hearing of his death,\nshe lay down and died. Her soul went to the Halls of Mandos, where she\nmanaged to charm Mandos into granting her a wish. Both she and Beren\nwere miraculously restored to life, but both of them would live as\nmortals and die the death of Men, and go beyond the walls of Arda to a\nplace unknown. Thus Beren and Lúthien lived again, and dwelt on Tol\nGalen in the middle of the river Adurant in Ossiriand. There they stayed\napart from other mortals; Beren was involved with the events of the\nFirst Age only one further time, when he waylaid a group of dwarves who\nhad destroyed Doriath and stolen the Nauglamír (and the Silmaril with\nit).\n\nLúthien bore Beren a son, named Dior, Thingol's heir, considered to be\none of the fairest beings to ever live, for in him flowed the blood of\nmen, of elves, and of the Ainur. Through his descendants, the blood of\nBeren and of Lúthien was preserved among the Eldar and the Edain.\n\nLegacy\n\nBeren's deeds inspired all the peoples opposing Morgoth to unite\nthemselves into a greater force to vanquish his power resulting in the\nvaliant but doomed Union of Maedhros. His romance and love for\nLúthien Tinúviel and what he was willing to do to ensure it helped\nfoster greater respect for men amongst the elves. He was also the first\nto mix the blood of elves and men with each other and this bloodline\ncontinued, siring the Númenórean nobility and the Dúnedain alike on\nup to Aragorn II Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Noldorin, the name _BEREN_ means “Bold”.\n\nHis epithets, _Erchamion_ (“one-handed”) and _Camlost_ (“empty-handed”),\nboth contain the Sindarin word _cam_ (“hand”).\n\n\nWeapons\n\nAs an outlaw in Dorthonion, Beren used Dagmor and a bow to aid him in\nhis journey. Later, he carried a knife called Angrist, which he used\nto cut the Silmaril from the Crown of Morgoth.\n\n\nInspiration and evolution of character\n\nThe story of Beren and Lúthien, though mentioned only briefly in _The\nLord of the Rings_, was a central part of the legendarium. Tolkien once\nreferred to it as “the kernel of the mythology” . He went on to say\nthat it \"arose from a small woodland glade filled with 'hemlocks', which\nhe visited while serving in the Humber Garrison in 1918 (during World\nWar I).\n\nTyr, a god of Norse Mythology, was a possible literary inspiration for\nBeren's loss of his hand to the wolf.\n\nWhen Tolkien died in 1973, he was buried in Wolvercote Cemetery (North\nOxford). The inscription on his gravestone reads:\n\n    JOHN RONALD REUEL TOLKIEN Beren 1892 - 1973\n\nThe name of _Lúthien_ also appears on the stone of his wife Edith:\n\n    EDITH MARY TOLKIEN Lúthien 1889 – 1971\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn the earliest version of the legendarium, Beren was going to be human,\nbut Tolkien erased over the original versions and wrote over much of the\ntext. The details of the original version of the story are little\nknown.\n\nIn the written draft, and published version Beren was changed to a GNOME\n(a Ñoldorin Elf), son of Egnor (which might have been an early name for\nAegnor). According to _Beren and Lúthien_ Egnor and Egnor (Aegnor)\nare two separate persons. It treats Barahir and Egnor bo-Rimion as two\nseparate persons (there is no explanation given, other than his father\nchanged concepts of Beren's race over time). But due to Christopher's\nplan to avoid too much editorial influence, he doesn't 'fix' or edit\nBeren's race to be consistent between different chapters of the story,\nbut retains whatever race his father had used at the time of wring each\nsection of the story for what he considers the 'continuous and\nstandalone story' derived from all the sources.\n\nSome of the artwork included in the book (all of which is drawn by Alan\nLee) seems to reflect Beren's interchanging Elven ancestry - in\nparticular the cover artwork, which appears to portray a scene from The\nTale of Tinúviel with Beren, Lúthien, and Huan.",

Bergil had an uncle named Iorlas,\nwho was the same age as Pippin. It is not certain whether Iorlas was the\nbrother of Beregond or of Bergil's mother, although Iorlas does not\nfollow the alliterative pattern evident in males known to be related to\nBeregond (_Bergil, Borlas_).\n\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in TA 3009, Bergil was nine years old at the time when the War of\nthe Ring began. He is one of the few children that remained in Minas\nTirith during that when the forces of Mordor were preparing to lay siege\non the city. He guides Peregrin Took throughout the city when he and\nGandalf arrived, and they became very good friends in the process.\nBefore the armies of Mordor were about to lay siege, Bergil and Pippin\nwitnessed the arrival of several armies from other parts of Gondor to\ndefend the city. During the siege of Minas Tirith, Bergil helped the\nhealers of the city as an errand runner and so eventually contributed to\nthe healing of Faramir, the Steward's son and later Prince of Ithilien.\n\nBergil who, running errands for the healers of Minas Tirith, told\nGandalf where Pippin and the injured Meriadoc Brandybuck were; Merry,\nsuffering from the Black Breath, had gotten lost during the battle over\nthe fields of Pelennor. He was also the one who brought the Athelas\nleaves to Aragorn; at that time, he showed his love for Faramir by\nbursting into tears. Bergil also kept Merry company while the Captains\nof the West led their men off to the Black Gate and then escorted him\nback to the Houses of Healing.\n\nOf Bergil's destiny the novel or its appendices tell nothing. It is\nprobable that he went with his father into Ithilien after the War of the\nRing was over. His younger brother Borlas was central to “The New\nShadow”, the soon-abandoned draft for a _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\n\nPersonality\n\nBergil is one of the few children in The Lord of the Rings who is\naffected by the course of war.

    "text": "BILBO BAGGINS was a Hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of ''The\nHobbit ''and a secondary character in ''The Lord of the Rings. ''\n\nGandalf suggested Bilbo Baggins to be hired by Thorin and Company to be\ntheir burglar in the Quest of Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of\nthe Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring, and\nthe first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He\nwrote many of his adventures in a book he called _There and Back Again_.\nBilbo adopted Frodo Baggins as his nephew after his parents, Drogo\nBaggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.\n\nBilbo was the first Hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and\nwas one of the few to visit the The Undying Lands across the ocean.\n\n*He is possibly named after a type of sword popularly used in the 16th\ncentury (which is also called Bilbo)\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nBilbo Baggins was born on September 22 by Shire Reckoning (around\nSeptember 12-14 of our calendar), in the year 2890 of the Third Age. He\nwas the only son of Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took.\n\n\n\nIn Hobbiton, Bungo Baggins constructed a spacious and luxurious\nHobbit-hole for Belladonna, which they named Bag End. The family moved\nto their new home, where Bilbo would spend much of his life.\n\nAs a young Hobbit, Bilbo was curious and eager for news of the outside\nworld. The Istar wizard, Gandalf, took interest in this unusual quality\nin Bilbo during his visits to the Shire. Bilbo would later remember\nGandalf's Fireworks displays in the dwelling of his mother's family at\nGreat Smials. Bilbo apparently practiced his rock-throwing skills in his\nyouth so much, that birds and squirrels fled the area whenever he bent\ndown to pick up a rock.\n\nWhen Bilbo's father and mother died in TA 2926 and TA 2934 respectively,\nBilbo became his own master and spent the next seven years living alone\nin Bag End. During this time, Bilbo grew fond of his life as a wealthy\nbachelor and acquired a reputation for respectability that the neighbors\nadmired.\n\nQuest of Erebor\n\nAn Unexpected Journey\n\nIn the year TA 2941, Bilbo, at the age of 50, was visited by Gandalf and\nthirteen dwarves (The Unexpected Party), led by Thorin Oakenshield.\nThese Dwarves wished to hire Bilbo as their burglar on their quest to\nreclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Bilbo reluctantly\nagreed to go, and the next morning they set off from _The Green Dragon\nInn_.\n\n\n\nThorin and company traveled through the Lone-lands along high hills and\nbeside castles. After approximately one month, Gandalf disappeared. Oín\nand Gloín failed to make a fire during a rainy night, and Balin spotted\na fire in the distance, which was rare in those regions, and sent Bilbo\nto investigate. At the fire were three Stone-trolls, Tom, Bert, and\nWilliam. Bilbo attempted to snatch something from the trolls to bring\nback to the Dwarves, to show that he was a first class burglar. However,\nhe was caught by William, but he escaped and was helpless to prevent all\nthe dwarves from being captured when they came looking for him.\nFortunately, Gandalf came in the nick of time and saved them all by\nimitating the Trolls' voices and tricking the trolls into arguing with\none another until daybreak, which turned them all to stone. After\nrescuing the party, the wizard led Bilbo and the party to the trolls'\ncave, which the latter used to hide their treasure and shield themselves\nfrom the sun during the daylight hours. In the cave, a number of weapons\nwere found, _Glamdring_ (Beater) and _Orcrist_ (Biter) among them. Bilbo\ntook an Elvish dagger from the trolls' collection, no longer than a\nsmall knife in size, which he would later name _Sting_. He kept it with\nhim for the rest of his adventure, wearing it inside his breeches.\n\nIn June they came to Rivendell. During their visit Bilbo met Elrond, and\nbecame enchanted with the Elves. On midsummer eve Elrond inspected the\nswords of Thorin and Gandalf, and looked at Thrór's Map. Elrond\nexplained that the swords were forged in Gondolin and were named Orcrist\nand Glamdring. When inspecting the map Elrond found Moon letters that\nspoke of the back door of Erebor, which read: _Stand by the grey stone\nwhen the thrush knocks, and the setting sun with the last light of\nDurin's Day will shine upon the keyhole._\n\nDiscovery of the One Ring\n\nBilbo and his companions then travelled from Rivendell and made their\nway to the Misty Mountains. It was here the companions encountered and\nfled from the Great Goblin and his immense forces. Bilbo, unfortunately,\nlost direction during the struggle and fell into a gaping hole within\nthe mountains. Luckily, he survived the fall and crawled his way through\nthe pitch-black tunnel, using his hobbit nose to gain a sense of\ndirection. Bilbo eventually stumbled upon a small ring, but thought\nnothing of it, and put it in his back pocket. Although he did not know\nit, this lost trinket was the One Ring, forged by Sauron many years ago.\nBilbo soon encountered Gollum, who had been in possession of the Ring\nfor over five hundred years. The two challenged each other to a game of\nriddles with the condition that Gollum would show the way out if Bilbo\nwon. However, Gollum was not satisfied with Bilbo's final riddle, and\nwhile mourning his loss, found that his Ring was gone. Gollum then\npaddled back on his boat towards Bilbo, who he then accused of stealing\nhis precious, but Bilbo had vanished.\n\n\n\nGollum, thinking Bilbo had known the way out and was leaving, headed to\nthe exit and was followed by Bilbo. Bilbo was soon reunited with his\ncompanions. Bilbo and the travellers had stopped for the night when\ngoblins and a pack of wargs found them near a patch of pine trees. The\ndwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf climbed up the trees to escape, but the\ngoblins were not going to leave without killing them. They started to\nburn the trees down. The Warg Chieftain was ordering the other wargs\naround when Gandalf picked up a pinecone, and with his magic set it\nablaze in a green fire. He threw it down hitting The Warg Chieftain. It\nrolled around on the ground burning while Gandalf threw more and more\npinecones down. The goblins and wargs fled and the group was rescued by\neagles. When an eagle grabbed Dori, Bilbo had to jump and grab Dori's\nlegs before he was forgotten. This prompted Bilbo to groan “My arms! My\npoor arms,” and Dori to cry, “My legs! My poor legs!” The eagles\neventually took them to their eyrie where they rested and continued\ntheir journey.\n\n\n\nThe group traveled to Beorn's house where they rested, after being\ngruffly taken in by Beorn and his animal servants. Beorn learned their\nstory and gave a large number of provisions to help their quest. Beorn\nalso lent several ponies to be used until the group reached Mirkwood.\nHowever, Beorn did not fully trust the dwarves, so Bilbo saw Beorn\ngiving careful watch to see that his ponies were unharmed. Eventually\nthe company reached Mirkwood, where the ponies were let go (to several\nof the dwarves discontent) and Gandalf left the group as well, warning\nthem, “Do not stray off the path.”\n\nThe Company began to follow the path through the treacherous forest.\nEventually the provisions ran low and the Company was forced to send\nBilbo up a tree to see where the forest ended. Bilbo climbed up a tree,\nwhere a rewarding breeze of cool air and butterflies met him. Bilbo only\nsaw more forest, so when he reluctantly climbed back down, he did not\nsee that the forest ended. He reported his findings to the dwarves,\nwhere they met the news with ill comfort, angry that the dwarves were\nfatter than Bilbo and so could not climb the trees to feel cool air or\nsee the butterflies. Eventually the last provisions were eaten. The\nCompany then came upon the Enchanted River. Bilbo saw a boat on the\nother side, leading the dwarves to retrieve it. A deer came out of\nnowhere when all the dwarves were on the other side. A dwarf shot it\nwhere it died, on the other side. The dwarves hoped for venison for\ndinner when Bilbo realized that Bombur was drowning. The dwarves fished\nhim out, where he was asleep, but the boat was knocked away, ending the\nhope for venison.\n\nWhile wandering down the path, the dwarves saw lights in the forest.\nDeciding that they would rather leave the path than starve to death they\nheaded after the lights. As soon as they got to the lights, they went\nout and one of their party fell asleep. This happened twice. On the\nthird time all of them fell asleep.\n\n\n\nWhen Bilbo awoke in the night, he was alone. He cursed the dwarves for\nleaving the path and discovered that spiders had captured his\ncompanions. Bilbo was forced to find his lost companions and cut through\nthe cocoons the spiders had formed around his companions. He distracted\nthe spiders by improvising several insulting songs to irritate the\nspiders, who left their domain to find the insulter and eat him. Bilbo\nkilled a few by throwing stones at a few spiders and he killed more via\nSting. They never found him, since he used the Ring to turn invisible.\nAfter freeing the dwarves, he led them into a charge against the\nspiders, where Bilbo killed dozens of the arachnids with the help of the\nRing and Sting.\n\nAfter traveling through Mirkwood Forest the dwarves were taken prisoner\nby Wood-elves, who believed that the company had “assaulted” the elves\nwhile they were partying (the bright lights the company had seen in the\nforest). Bilbo avoided being caught by using his ring to stay invisible,\nand followed them into the halls of the elf-king where they were held\ncaptive. Eventually Bilbo was able to rescue the dwarves and soon they\nall arrived at Lake Town, a small town occupied by men where Smaug would\nfrequently attack, though he had not been seen in many years. The group\nsearched the mountainside until they found the secret door. Bilbo alone\nwas sent in to steal some treasure from Smaug. When he arrived, Smaug\nwas awake and sensed his presence. Bilbo put on the ring so as to avoid\nbeing noticed.\n\nSmaug tried to figure out who or what Bilbo was, but Bilbo would not\ntell Smaug his true identity, answering Smaug's questions only in\nriddles. While invisible, Bilbo saw that Smaug had a bare spot on his\njewel-encrusted underbelly. Finally, Bilbo removed the ring and Smaug\nsaw that he had stolen a cup, causing him to go into a terrible rage.\nAfter Bilbo made it out of Smaug's lair safely, the dragon flew off to\nLaketown. Bilbo told a thrush to send word to Bard of Smaug's weakness.\nBard shot the Black Arrow at the bare spot, killing Smaug and sending\nhim to rot at the bottom of the lake, but destroying part of Lake Town.\n\nBattle of Five Armies and aftermath\n\nIn Lake Town, after Thorin Oakenshield reclaimed the mountain, the\nBattle of the Five Armies took place. Beorn, the Beorning chieftain,\njoined the travellers in their fight against an army of orcs. After the\nbattle, Bilbo found Thorin lying on a bed, dying. Thorin praised Bilbo\nand apologized to him for cursing him earlier.\n\nAfter Thorin's funeral, Dain offered him his one-fourteenth share of the\ntreasure, but Bilbo declined, receiving only two small chests, one with\ngold, and the other laden with silver. Bilbo traveled back with the\nwood-elf host that participated in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo\ntraveled with the wood-elves down to Mirkwood, and then went to Beorn's\nhouse with Gandalf. Then Bilbo set out with Gandalf to where Bert, Tom,\nand William had turned to stone. They dug up some of the buried treasure\nthe dwarves had buried earlier, most of which Bilbo offered to Gandalf\nto use to aid the peoples of Middle-Earth. Bilbo eventually made it back to Hobbiton, where he\nfound an auction taking place in which his relatives, the\nSackville-Bagginses, believing him dead, were selling most of his\npossessions to the other hobbits. The Sackville-Bagginses were vexed to\nsee Bilbo alive, since they wanted to live in Bag End themselves. Bilbo\nhad to buy back his sold possessions in order to avoid quarreling with\nthem. Eventually, Balin and Gandalf visited him, where they reported the\ncurrent news of Middle-earth.\n\nReturn in the Shire\n\nAlthough Bilbo returned safely to Bag End with his reward and lived in\nrelative comfort, Bilbo’s life was not quite the same as it had once\nbeen. His sudden return after having been thought dead lost him some of\nthe neighbors’ respect and he was later thought of as an oddity, and\nthere was much talk and false rumors circulated about his affairs and\ndoings. The worst of these problems came from the Sackville-Bagginses,\nwho were angry that they were not able to possess Bag End when he was\nthought to be dead. This jealousy and anger increased when Bilbo adopted\nhis nephew Frodo (a Brandybuck) as his heir apparent.\n\nBilbo ignored these things said about him and avoided the\nSackville-Bagginses as much as he could, even using the Ring once to\nhide from them. Bilbo was very generous with his money and most people\nwere willing to forgive him his oddities. He had many friends especially\namongst the Gamgees whom he consulted frequently on landscaping and on\nthe growing of vegetables. His good friend The Gaffer even allowed him\nto tutor his son Samwise Gamgee. Bilbo taught him to read and write, and\nat some point taught him various bits of poetry and told him tales of\nthe elder days. Yet, he slowly began to become weary of his settled and\nsheltered life at Bag End.\n\n\n\nBilbo was the bearer of the One Ring for six decades, ignorant of its\nsignificance. However, by TA 3001, the Ring had begun to affect him. He\ndid not appear to have aged at all, although he felt older and thin\ninside. He decided that he wanted to partake in one more adventure,\nbefore he found a place to settle down and finish his account of the\nQuest for the Lonely Mountain.\n\n\n\nOn September 22, a farewell Birthday Party was held in his honour, where\nhe announced his intention to leave the Shire, to the shock of his\nfamily and friends. Immediately afterwards, he put on his ring and\ndisappeared, as a joke on his neighbours. He returned to his house where\nhe was confronted by his friend Gandalf, who tried to persuade him to\nleave the ring for Frodo. Bilbo initially agreed, but then became\nhostile and accused Gandalf of trying to steal the ring for his own\nbenefit, which he referred to as his “precious.” Horrified by Bilbo's\noutburst, Gandalf stood to his full height and ordered Bilbo to leave it\nbehind. Immediately Bilbo returned to his senses, apologising and\nadmitting that the Ring had been troubling him lately. After a moment of\ninner struggle, Bilbo finally dropped the ring to the ground, becoming\nthe first ring-bearer to give up the ring on his own will. Bilbo and\nGandalf bade each other goodbye, and Bilbo left the Shire for his\njourney.\n\nOn the same day, Bilbo left the One Ring and his home of Bag End in the\npossession of his relative, Frodo Baggins who was eager to be his own\nmaster despite the loss of Bilbo, for he was not yet ready to leave the\nShire. After his departure, Bilbo wandered to Rivendell and then, after\na rest, accompanied some dwarves to Dale, before returning to Rivendell.\n\nLife in Rivendell\n\n\n\nBetween TA 3003 and TA 3018, Bilbo worked on the written account of his\nadventures, in a book that would later be known as the _Red Book of\nWestmarch_. He also studied the Elvish language and compiled a\nthree-volume history of the Elder Days, which he called _Translations\nfrom the Elvish_. He composed the poem _All that is Gold Does Not\nGlitter_ for Aragorn as well as a much longer poem about Eärendil during\nhis stay at Rivendell.\n\nIn October 3018, Frodo arrived at Rivendell. Bilbo learnt that his\nnephew was on a quest to destroy the One Ring so he gave him the sword\nSting and for protection his mithril shirt. However, he remained in\nRivendell while Frodo travelled south. After Frodo returned, Bilbo had\nnoticeably aged, partially freed from the Ring's effect, although he\ncontinued to desire it.\n\n\n\nSince Bilbo had been a ring-bearer, he was allowed to accompany Frodo to\nthe Undying Lands. On September 22, 3021, Bilbo turned 131, and became\nthe oldest Hobbit in Middle-earth (unless Sméagol is counted to have\nremained a Hobbit). On September 29, he, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel and\nFrodo boarded a ship docked at the Grey Havens and sailed away from\nMiddle-earth. His fate afterwards is not known but as he too was a\nmortal being, he most likely died in the light of the Blessed Realm of\nValinor.\n\n\nCharacter\n\n\n\nBilbo was a very friendly and well-mannered hobbit fond of food, drink,\na full pipe, his friends and good cheer, and was known for greeting\nstrangers and friends with hospitality saying; “At your service and your\nfamilies”. Being related to both the Tooks and the Baggins two family\ngroups that were fundamentally opposite in their mentalities, with the\nTooks being more fond of adventures and wandering, and the Baggins who\nwere more fond of the settled life, Bilbo had two different sides to\nhim, something he referred to as the “Took side” and the “Baggins side”.\nThis meant that he secretly relished having adventures but still wanted\nto remain settled and was very afraid.\nBilbo seemed to be happy with his life at Bag End, and would have been\ncontent to remain a child of his father, had adventure not come upon\nhim. Still very afraid and wishing he had never left his hobbit-hole,\nthe Took side eventually won out, even after he returned home to his old\nlife. Thus, his desire for another adventure never truly departed from\nhim in his heart even into his old age. This he demonstrated in his\nsudden departure from Bag End in TA 3001.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nOther names\n\n-   Bur-a-hobbit\n-   The Barrel Rider\n-   Burglar\n-   Thief in the Shadows\n-   Child of the kindly West\n-   Clue-finder\n-   Guest of Eagles\n-   The Lucky Number\n-   Luckwearer\n-   Old Mad Baggins\n-   The Ring Winner\n-   The Spider Stinger\n-   Stinging Fly\n-   He that walks unseen\n-   Mr. Boggins\n-   The Web Cutter\n\nEarlier names\n\n-   Bilba Labingi, the original hobbit name for Bilbo\n\n\nBilbo's writings\n\n\n\nTranslations\n\n-   _Translations from the Elvish_\n-   _The Fall of Gil-galad_\n\nComposed works\n\n-   _There and Back Again_\n-   _The Road Goes Ever On_\n-   _All that is Gold Does Not Glitter_\n-   _Song of Eärendil_\n-   _The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late_\n-   _A Walking Song_ (Wrote the lyrics)\n-   _Warning of Winter_\n-   _Bilbo's Last Song_\n\n\nAppearances in the Books and Films\n\nIn the books\n\n-   _The Hobbit_ (First appearance)\n-   _The Lord of the Rings_\n-   _The Silmarillion_\n-   _Unfinished Tales_\n\nIn the films\n\n-   _An Unexpected Journey_\n-   _The Desolation of Smaug_\n-   _The Battle of the Five Armies_\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _The Two Towers_ (Mentioned only)\n-   _The Return of the King_.",

He is best known for being\ncompanions to Bilbo Baggins, Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf on the quest\nto reclaim Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, along with his brother\nBombur and cousin Bifur.\n\n\nBiography\n\nBofur was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, but was not of\nDurin's Folk. He and his family hailed from the Blue Mountains. As such,\nthey felt less strongly about the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain\nfrom the dragon Smaug, more interested in the adventure than a home\nthey'd never seen.\n\nBofur's family were miners, and he and his cousin Bifur also dabbled in\ntoy-making, crafting the wonderful mechanical toys that were so famous\nin Dale. Life in the Blue Mountains was difficult, but Bofur remained\ncheerfully optimistic, with a love of mince pies, cheese, and music - he\nplayed the clarinet. Bofur maintained a close but feisty relationship\nwith his brother Bombur whom he often teased but always looked after.\n\nQuest to Erebor\n\nWhile answering Thorin Oakenshield's quest to Erebor, Bofur went to the\nmeeting at Bag End with his brother Bombur and cousin Bifur. Bofur later\nexplains to Bilbo about Smaug, for which Bilbo faints afterwards,\nprompting Gandalf to sarcastically say “thanks a lot, Bofur”. After the\ncompany left Bag End, and Bilbo realized he had forgotten his\nhankerchief, Bofur tossed him a wet rag, causing many of the other\nDwarves to laugh. Once the company had reached Rivendell, Bofur tossed\nhis brother Bombur a sausage, causing the bench he was sitting on to\nbreak, causing all the Dwarves to break out in laughter. When Bilbo was\ngoing to leave to Rivendell, Bofur attempted to convince him not to,\nhowever, realizing that Bilbo was truly homesick, he wished him the best\nof luck. however, Bofur pointed out to Bilbo that Sting was glowing.\nBofur can later be seen fighting Orcs, and later fighting Orcs and Wargs\nalong with the rest of the company. \n\n\nLater life\n\nNothing is known about his life after the Battle of Five Armies.

    "text": "FREDEGAR “FATTY” BOLGER was one of the small group of Hobbits who knew\nthat Frodo had the Ring. Fatty was a descendant of Hildibrand Took (TA\n2849 - TA 2934), one of the many sons of the Gerontius Took. He was the\nson of Odovacar Bolger and Rosamunda Took. Fatty was born in TA 2980.\n\nHe had a younger sister, ESTELLA (TA 2985 - ?), who married Meriadoc\nBrandybuck.\n\n\nHistory\n\n Fatty, along with Folco Boffin, Sam, Merry\nand Pippin is one of Frodo Baggins's friends, and helped move his things\nfrom Bag End to his new home at Crickhollow. There, he and Merry welcome\nFrodo, Sam and Pippin when those three arrive from Bucklebury.\n\nWhen Frodo and the rest set out to take the Ring to Rivendell, Fredegar\nstayed behind at Crickhollow in an attempt to keep up appearances and\ndelay news of their departure. He was frightened half out of his wits by\nthe arrival of the Nazgûl but escaped unharmed. Fredegar could have gone\nwith Frodo and his companions into the Old Forest, but was terrified of\nthe stories about it. Though Merry tried to persuade him that the Old\nForest would be nothing compared to meeting the Ringwraiths, Fatty was\nadamant, so the other Hobbits went into the forest with only the\nknowledge of Merry to aid them. Soon while Frodo and his other friends\nleft Fatty stayed to make Frodo seem like he hadn't left. Then on\nSeptember the 30th Fredegard was attacked by Nazgûl and ran to the\nnearest house and raised the Horn-call of Buckland and so the Nazgûl\nleft.\n\nDuring Saruman's rule of the Shire he led a group of partisans fighting\nagainst the Ruffians around the Hills of Scary, before eventually being\ncaptured. He and his sons were imprisoned in the Lockholes and starved,\nmeaning that after his release nobody could call him Fatty any more.\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nIn earlier drafts of _The Lord of the Rings_ Fatty Bolger played a much\nlarger role, but this was later abandoned. His role survives as a minor\nanomaly in the book — before the Hobbits go into the Old Forest, they\nhave five ponies prepared — but only take four. Bolger was originally\nsupposed to go with them.\n\nIt might be argued that Fredegar Bolger is the least heralded but\nperhaps the most significant of all the heroes of the War of the Rings:\nby delaying the Nazgul just slightly, he may well have turned the whole\ncourse of the War in favor of the West away from Sauron.... and for his\nheroism is starved in the Lockholes.\n\n\n\nSMALL APPEARANCE IN THE MOVIE\n\nIn the extended edition of the Fellowship of the Ring, there is a brief\nclip of Bilbo greeting Fatty Bolger, however, they do not show his face,\nand the clip is very brief. Some minutes later he appears again,\ncheering as Bilbo shouts his name. Though it is not confirmed that the\nhobbit cheering was Fatty, it is likely, as his appearance is very\nsimilar to that of the Fatty Bolger Bilbo greeted.",

His brother Bofur and\ncousin Bifur also were part of the company.\n\n\nBiography\n\nBombur's parentage is unknown; the only familial connections mentioned\nare his brother Bofur and his cousin Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's\nline although he was descended from Dwarves of Moria. His birth year is\nalso unknown, however, from Bilbo Baggins' account from the quest to\nErebor it is known that the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of\nthe 13 “by some fifty years” and that after Thorin had been captured,\nBalin was “the eldest left”. Since Fíli was born in TA 2859 and Balin\nwas born in TA 2763, this would put Bombur's birth between 2763 and\n2809, and he would have been between 132 and 178 years old during the\nquest to Erebor. Prior to the quest Bombur probably lived in the Blue\nMountains with Thorin after the loss of Thráin II.\n\nThe Quest for Erebor\n\n\n\nBombur is the twelfth Dwarf to arrive at Bag End. Because he counts for\ntwo, he is the last to enter Beorn's house and the last to cross the\nEnchanted river in Mirkwood. Bombur is first introduced when he tumbles\nwith Bifur and Bofur onto Thorin when they enter Bag End, and he also is\nknocked into the Enchanted river (and falls asleep). He chooses to stay\nand guard the camp, and supplies while the others move up the Lonely\nMountain because he trusts neither mountain paths nor ropes. Later\nthough, he is forced to use the ropes to escape the rampaging dragon\nSmaug.\n\nBombur sleeps at several key moments in the book. When he is violently\nknocked into the Mirkwood River by an aggressive stag, he falls under a\nspell that makes him sleep for days, burdening the others with his\nweight as they walked on. While he is on a midnight lookout in the\nfortified Lonely Mountain, Bilbo promises to keep watch so that he can\nsleep a bit longer and take another watch later (Bilbo used this\nopportunity to sneak the Arkenstone out of the mountain). Incidentally,\nhe was asleep when they opened his barrel after escaping the Elves of\nMirkwood and also when Bilbo discovered the secret entrance to Lonely\nMountain. Bombur is always last and doesn't enjoy it. When the Dwarves,\nGandalf, and Bilbo meet Beorn, Bombur comes last. He comes along\nstraight after Bifur and Bofur so he won't be last. He fought at and\nsurvived the Battle of the Five Armies. Following the defeat of Smaug,\nDain II Ironfoot gave him his share of the treasure and he remained to\nlive at the Lonely Mountain.\n\nLater Years\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings_, many years later, Frodo Baggins inquires\nafter Bombur and learns that he has grown so fat it takes several\nDwarves to lift him to the dinner table. It is unlikely that Bombur\nfought in the Battle of Dale due to his over weight.\n\n\nWeapons and abilities\n\nIn Peter Jackson's Hobbit film trilogy, Bombur can be seen using a\nnumber of different weapons and tools to fight off enemies. His primary\nweapon is an iron ladle, which he wields during _An Unexpected Journey_.\nHe also uses a cleaver or butcher's knife to slash enemies. In _The\nDesolation of Smaug_, he uses the same weapons but usually wields an\naxe. Of course, his greatest weapon is his size which he uses to crush\nand bounce away opponents. Bombur and his family are not classically\ntrained fighters but are lethal with any sort of tool in their hands.\n\nHe also is surprisingly agile for a dwarf of his size and weight. He is\nvery capable of performing stunts such as when, in the second film, he\npole vaults into a barrel. He has an astonishing degree of durability,\nand can withstand a hard landing on a great number of Orcs, and also\nabsorbs an incredible amount of momentum in the process, without\nbreaking a limb or causing himself any visible degree of injury. In\naddition, he is a quick thinker and uses his ingenuity frequently to\nhelp push past Orcs or leap across gaps.",

He, his brother, and two others were the only\nsurvivors of the unit that held the bridge until its destruction; they\nhad to swim the river Anduin to reach safety.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\n\n\nBoromir, by order of his father, Denethor, set out from Minas Tirith to\nRivendell to decipher a riddle that was given to him and his brother in\ntheir dreams:\n\n    _Seek for the Sword that was broken,_\n    _In Imladris it dwells,_\n    _There shall be counsels taken,_\n    _Stronger than Morgul-spells._\n    _There shall be shown a token,_\n    _That Doom is near at hand,_\n    _For Isildur's Bane shall waken,_\n    _And the Halfling forth shall stand._\n\nBoromir lost his horse in Tharbad and travelled the rest of the way on\nfoot. The journey took 110 days. He arrived at the beginning of the\nCouncil of Elrond where he talked about how Gondor was defending itself\nfrom Mordor and tried to convince them to give the One Ring to Gondor\nwhere he felt it would be kept safe. But the council disagreed with the\nOne Ring's being taken to Gondor, deciding that the only safe course was\nto destroy it.\n\nBoromir joined the Fellowship of the Ring and was warned by Elrond to\nnot blow the Horn of Gondor until they were close to Gondor and in dire\nneed. He proved his worth as a capable warrior in the Mines of Moria,\nand assisted Aragorn in fighting off a large number of orcs and goblins.\nAfter the loss of Gandalf and the Fellowship's departure of Moria,\nBoromir expressed opposition to Aragorns decision to continue to Lorien,\nargueing that to go south was better. He believed that stories told in\nGondor of the Galadriel's magic would harm them. He eventually agreed to\ngo after Aragorn assured him the elves would help them. In Lothlórien,\nBoromir was disturbed by what he felt was Galadriel's testing of his\nmind, and he was suspicious of her motives. Before leaving Lothlórien\nhe was given the gift of an elven-cloak and a golden belt.\n\nBoromir disliked the idea of destroying the One Ring, as he believed\nthat it could be used to defeat Sauron once and for all, to save Gondor,\nand return it to its former glory; he tried to convince Frodo to give\nhim the Ring. When Frodo refused, Boromir tried to take it by force but\nthe hobbit put it on and fled.\n\nAfter Boromir realized his actions were caused by the corruption of the\nOne Ring, he repented, and upon returning to camp he was confronted by\nAragorn about Frodo. Boromir told Aragorn that he had seen Frodo an hour\nago where he had tried to convince Frodo to bring the One Ring to Minas\nTirith. They then had an argument and Frodo walked off. After the\nargument Boromir went for a walk, until eventually returning to the\ncamp. The Fellowship, especially Aragorn, believed that there was more\nto the confrontation than Boromir was telling them, but Aragorn did not\npress the issue. Upon hearing of Frodo's predicament, the rest of the\nFellowship, particularly the Hobbits, scattered in an ill-concieved\nattempt to find him. Aragorn ordered Boromir to follow and look after\nMerry and Pippin while he took off after Sam.\n\nDuring the search, Merry and Pippin ran into a group of Uruk-Hai,\nwho tried to capture them. Boromir came to their aid and drove the orcs\noff, but more orcs came and Boromir was mortally wounded by many arrows.\nAragorn found him dying under a tree, with Merry and Pippin gone. He\nstayed with Boromir until he died from his wounds.\n\nAragorn, Legolas, and Gimli laid his body inside one of the boats of\nLórien, and sent him down the Falls of Rauros. Afterwards, they sang the\nLament for Boromir.\n\nLegacy\n\n\n\nThree days after Boromir's death, his brother Faramir saw his funeral\nboat passing down the Anduin. Men of Gondor found Boromir's horn, the\nHorn of Gondor, broken in twain, and brought it to his father. This\ndrove Denethor to despair, and when compounded with Faramir's later\nseemingly-mortal wounding and his knowledge of Mordor's indomitable\nmight, he lost his mind. Many, including Faramir, often lamented\nBoromir's passing as Sauron readied his forces to attack, noting that\nhis loss would be keenly felt by Gondor on the field of battle.\n\nBoromir won respect even from his enemies: in _The Two Towers_, Ugluk\nboasts that it was the Uruk-hai who “slew the mighty warrior,” a clear\nreference to Boromir.\n\n\nPersonality\n\nBoromir was above all else exceedingly valiant and steadfast, and was\nheld in great esteem by the fighting men of many nations. He was noted\nas being somewhat dissimilar in manner and thought from both his father,\nDenethor, and his brother Faramir, but he loved them both greatly. He\nwas selfless and bold, but he took little interest in the books and\nscrolls that his brother so often read, having little interest in lore.\nIt was said of him by Éomer that he had a great deal in common with the\npeople of Rohan. However, his desire to protect his people, and his\ninability to do so, left him vulnerable to the predations of the One\nRing. This eventually caused him to attempt to take it from Frodo,\nthough he deeply regretted this almost immediately after it occurred. At\none point, when envisioning he would have hoped to achieve if he took\nthe One Ring and overthrew Sauron, his world after Sauron's defeat was\none of peace and security, where he used the Ring to rule with wisdom\nand generosity.",

    "text": "MERIADOC “MERRY” BRANDYBUCK (later known as Meriadoc “Merry” Brandybuck\nI, due to his grandson's birth) was a Hobbit and one of Frodo's cousins\nand closest friends. He loved boats and ponies and had a great interest\nin the maps of Middle-earth. He was also one of the nine companions in\nThe Fellowship of the Ring.\n\n\nBiography\n\nMerry was born in TA 2982. He was the only child of Saradoc Brandybuck\n(TA 2940 - FO 11), Master of Buckland, and Esmeralda Took (TA 2936 - ?),\nthe younger sister of Paladin Took II , making him first cousin to\nPaladin's son Pippin, who was clearly his closest friend.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nMerry was considered the most perceptive and intelligent of the hobbits,\nfor example, even before Frodo Baggins leaves the Shire, he knew of the\nOne Ring and its power. He guarded Bag End after Bilbo's party,\nprotecting Frodo from the various and often unwanted guests. He also was\nthe force behind “the Conspiracy” of Sam, Pippin, Fredegar Bolger (more\ncommonly known as “Fatty”, due to his plump form) and himself to help\nFrodo. Thus, even before the Quest of the Ring begins, Merry was well\nprepared and organized; he assembled their gear and brought ponies. His\nshortcut through the Old Forest served them well, because they avoided\nthe Black Riders and met Tom Bombadil, who helped them. At the\nBarrow-downs, Merry acquired his sword, a work of Westernesse.\n\n\n\nAt Bree, he was not present in the Prancing Pony when Frodo foolishly\nput on the ring; but was outside taking a walk, and was nearly killed by\nthe Nazgûl who arrived. At Rivendell, he was seen studying maps and\nplotting their path. His approval to the Fellowship came with only a\nlittle less reluctance than Pippin's; they were the two to relay news to\nthe people of the Shire about Frodo's journey, but in the end Gandalf,\nbelieving in the friendship and loyalty shown to Frodo and Sam,\nrequested that Elrond allow the two hobbits to come along. At Amon Hen\nhe was captured along with Pippin by a band of Saruman's\nfighting Uruk-hai, but he made a good account for himself, and Boromir\nvaliantly defended him, though Boromir died in the attempt.\n\nEscaping with Pippin into Fangorn Forest, Treebeard and the newly risen\nGandalf the White met him. Along with Pippin, he drank significant\namounts of Entwash, which contributed to speedy gains in height and hair\ngrowth. Accompanying Treebeard to the Entmoot, and later to Isengard, he\nand Pippin were set as guardians following Saruman's fall. It was here\nthat Merry encountered King Théoden of Rohan, and was reunited with the\nremaining members of the Fellowship (save Frodo and Sam).\n\n\n\nSeparated from Pippin when Gandalf took the latter to Gondor, Merry\nswore fealty to Théoden and became his squire. Without permission from\nhis liege, he rode to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in the care of\nyoung Dernhelm (who was actually Éowyn, though Merry didn't know it).\nWhen Nazgûl attacked the Riders of Rohan and Théoden was injured, Merry\nand Éowyn faced the Witch King of Angmar alone. Here, Merry's companion\nrevealed herself to be Éowyn. Battling both fell beast and the Nazgûl\nalone, Éowyn was well assisted by Merry's crucial move: his sword, built\nfor this very purpose, was one of the few weapons able to pierce the\nRingwraith's form, but at a great expense to himself. He cut the Witch\nKing behind the knee as he was about to kill Eowyn. This was enough to\nallow Éowyn to finish off the Witch-king. Merry heard Théoden's last\nwords, but went unnoticed by the honour escort of Riders and was found\nwandering the city by Pippin. He was saved by the healing of Aragorn and\nrecovered fully.\n\nFor his bravery in battle, King Éomer, as the new King of Rohan,\nknighted him and gave him the name of “Holdwine”. During the Scouring of\nthe Shire, he was in the forefront of the Battle of Bywater, using the\nHorn of Rohan presented to him by Éowyn.\n\nLegacy\n\nUpon their return he and Pippin both got married to beautiful hobbit\nwomen. They were also the tallest of hobbits - Meriadoc being the\nslightly taller of the two - taller even than the legendary Bandobras\n“Bullroarer” Took, due to their having drunk large amounts of Entwater.\nMerry married Estella Bolger some time after the end of the Third Age.\nHe became the Master of Buckland in SR 1432 (FA 11). He wrote _Old Words\nand Names in the Shire._ Although he was not recorded as having any\nchildren within the family trees, he clearly had at least one son. At\nthe age of 102, he returned to Rohan and Gondor with Pippin, dying there\naround the year FO 64. He was laid to rest in Gondor, and when Elessar\ndied in the Fourth Age 120, he and Pippin were entombed beside the great\nking.\n\n\nWeapons\n\nSword\n\nMerry uses a short barrow-blade for melee combat in books and video\ngames, but in the movies he loses his barrow blade and instead wields\na Rohirrim short sword and wears a helmet, shield and leather jerkin\nthat were originally made for the young King Theoden. The\nblade dissolved during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields when it was\nused to stab the Witch-king of Angmar (Ringwraith, King of the Nazgûl).\n\nThrowing Weapons\n\nMerry can use rocks to hit opponents from a distance. In _The Lord of\nthe Rings: The Return of the King (video game)_, he uses throwing knives\ninstead of rocks, like all other Hobbits. In his case, however, his\ndaggers are slightly stronger.",

He and his folk were the first of\nMankind to encounter the Ñoldor of Beleriand when King Finrod Felagund\nhappened upon their camp in Ossiriand in the year FA 310. After years of\nwandering westwards in search of the High Elves (or the Valar, of whom\nthe Bëorians had heard rumor from the lesser elves they had met in the\neast), Bëor was eager to establish good relations with Felagund, and the\ntwo strove to understand each other. The language barrier was not a\nmajor problem due to the similarities between the tongue of the\nBëorians, which had been influenced by the elves they had met earlier,\nand the Sindarin tongue. In the tongue of his people, called Taliska,\nBëor was named 'Balan'. The name he is more commonly called by, Bëor was\nactually the Taliska word for 'vassal', which he earned in the service\nof Felagund.\n\n\n\nBëor and his people settled first in Ossiriand, but were at odds with\nthe Green-elves that already dwelt there, for the men competed with the\nelves for food and natural resources. Therefore, on the advice of\nFelagund, Bëor led his people to Estolad, the encampment, in the realm\nof Amrod and Amras, sons of Fëanor. There the people of the first house\nbecame more numerous and were enriched by the teachings of the Eldar.\nBëor, however, was not content and wanted to leave Estolad and enter\ninstead into the service of King Felagund. He committed the rule of his\npeople to Baran, his son, and departed with Felagund to his realm of\nNargothrond. There Bëor continued his service with Felagund, and he\nreturned never to Estolad. He died in the year 355 of the First Age at\nthe age ninety-three, having spent 44 years in the service of Felagund.\nHis death was greatly lamented by King Finrod and his people, who\nwitnessed for the first time the Gift of Men: death. But in the end Bëor\ngave up his life willingly and died in peace, a thing previously unheard\nof by the elves, who wondered much at the strange lives of men.\n\nBëor was held among the Wise of the Edain, and was revered by many among\nthe Eldar.

His lineage and influence\nleft him in a position to challenge the current king, Eldacar, who was\nonly half Dúnedain. As King Valacar's only son, Eldacar was the\nlegitimate heir to the throne, but his half Rhovanion lineage angered\ncitizens who believed in a pure dúnedain royalty. Capitalizing on what\nbecame outright protest against the current king, Castamir was able to\nincite rebellion and besiege Eldacar within the city Osgiliath in TA\n1437 of the Third Age. The city was set on fire by Castamir's troops,\ndestroying the famed Dome of Stars. Shortly thereafter, Eldacar fled the\ncity and into exile in Rhovanion, to the north. With the defeat of the\nking, Castamir seized the throne.\n\nFor ten years Castamir ruled Gondor with an iron fist, while Eldacar\nquietly regained power. Castamir ruled cruelly, and committed many foul\ndeeds, including executing Eldacar's own son, Ornendil. At first the\npeople of Gondor tolerated Castamir because of his pure Númenórean\nblood. Then, in 1447, Castamir, now called “the Usurper” by his people\nwas overthrown after a decade of wicked rule with the people now\nrallying around the true king, Eldacar. He was slain by Eldacar's forces\nat the Battle of Erui, the decisive battle of the Kin-strife as this\nperiod came to be known. At the Crossings of Erui, Eldacar personally\nslew Castamir.\n\nCastamir's influence did not end there. Remnants of his forces, and his\nsurviving sons, retreated from the Battle of Erui to the port of\nPelargir and escaped by ship to Umbar, far to the south. These\ndescendants of Castamir became the so-called “Corsairs of Umbar”, fierce\npirates who terrorized the ports of Gondor with the help of the men of\nHarad. They were perhaps the greatest threat to Gondor for nearly 400\nyears, commanding massive fleets of ships. Their most infamous exploit\nwas the Raid of Pelargir in TA 1634, in which a Corsair armada led by\nhis great-grandsons Angamaitë‎ and Sangahyando‎ sailed up the river\nAnduin to the port of Pelargir, deep in Gondor's territory. This raid\ncoincided with the young King Minardil's visit, and he was slain in by\nthe Corsairs as they attacked.\n\nThey remained a significant threat until TA 1810, when King Telumehtar\nretook Umbar for Gondor. So great a victory was this, that forever after\nTelumehtar was known as Umbardacil, which literally means “victor over\nUmbar”. In this battle the last descendants of Castamir were finally\nkilled.",

    "text": "CELEBORN was the_' Lord of Lothlórien_', and his wife was Galadriel,\nLady of the Golden Wood. Celeborn was said to be one of the wisest Elves\nin Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Celeborn defended Lothlórien and led the\nassault on the Enemy castle of Dol Guldur. He remained in Middle-earth\nfor a time at the beginning of the Fourth Age, but eventually he joined\nhis wife in the Undying Lands.\n\n\nBiography\n\nOrigins\n\nCeleborn was a Prince of Doriath and a kinsman of Thingol, the King of\nDoriath. Celeborn was said to be the grandson of Thingol's brother Elmo.\nCeleborn's father was Galadhon and he had a brother named Galathil.\n\nFirst Age\n\nAround FA 52, Galadriel came to Doriath. Galadriel was one of the Ñoldor\nwho came to Middle-earth wishing to see the lands and rule a realm of\nher own. She came with the second 'group' of elves from Aman with\nFingolfin and Finrod. Celeborn and Galadriel fell in love and married\neach other.\n\nIt is not clear how long Celeborn and Galadriel dwelled in Beleriand.\nAccording to one story, they left Beleriand and crossed the Blue\nMountains into Eriador before the Fall of Nargothrond in FA 495, but\naccording to another story they remained in Beleriand until the end of\nthe First Age.\n\nAround FA 502, King Thingol of Doriath summoned dwarf craftsmen to set a\nSilmaril in Nauglamir, the fabled jeweled Necklace of the Dwarves. The\ndwarf craftsmen coveted the necklace and especially the Silmaril, and\nthey demanded that Thingol give it to them. When Thingol refused, they\nkilled him and took the necklace set with the Silmaril. The Dwarven\ncraftsmen were pursued by Elves of Doriath, who killed the Dwarves and\nretrieved the necklace. However, two Dwarves escaped and returned to\nNogrod in the Blue Mountains and rallied their kinsmen to seek vengeance\non the Elves of Doriath. An army of Dwarves attacked Doriath and\ndefeated the elves. They took the necklace once more, but Beren again\nreclaimed it.\n\nDoriath was briefly re-inhabited by Beren's son Dior Eluchíl, but the\nsons of Feanor came to try to take the Silmaril. Though Dior's daughter\nElwing escaped with the Silmaril, Dior was killed and Doriath was ruined\nand abandoned.\n\nCeleborn's distrust of Dwarves began at this time. His role in these\nevents is unknown, although in one account it is written that Celeborn\nescaped the sack of Doriath.\n\nThe First Age ended with the War of Wrath and the defeat of Morgoth.\nBeleriand was ruined and sank beneath the Sea. Many of the Ñoldor\nreturned to the Undying Lands with the pardon of the Valar, but\nGaladriel remained in Middle-earth with Celeborn.\n\nSecond Age\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel probably lived for a time in Lindon, a coastal\nregion west of the Blue Mountains. Gil-galad was the High King of the\nelves who dwelled in Lindon. However, many of the elves in Harlindon -\nthe part of Lindon south of the Gulf of Lune - were Sindarin elves like\nCeleborn, and he may have ruled a fiefdom there under Gil-galad.\n\nAt some time early in the Second Age, Celeborn and Galadriel are said to\nhave moved eastward into Eriador with a number of Elves in their\nfollowing. They may have lived for a while near Lake Evendim. Their\ndaughter Celebrian may have been born during this time. They began to\nmove eastward again around the year SA 700 because Galadriel sensed a\ngrowing evil in Middle-earth that she felt duty-bound to oppose.\n\nThe realm of Eregion was founded in SA 750, and Galadriel and Celeborn\nare said to have dwelled there for a time along with Celebrimbor and the\nElven-smiths. The Elves of Eregion had dealings with the Dwarves of\nKhazad-dûm nearby, but Celeborn still distrusted Dwarves and would not\nenter Khazad-dûm, although the Dwarves there had nothing to do with the\ndestruction of Doriath.\n\nThe Elves of Eregion also had contact with the Elves of Lothlórien on\nthe other side of the Misty Mountains. According to one story, Galadriel\nwent to dwell in Lothlórien around SA 1350 to SA 1400 while Celeborn\nremained in Eregion. However, in other versions of the story both\nGaladriel and Celeborn stayed in Eregion.\n\nSauron came to Eregion in a fair disguise as Annatar the “Lord of gifts”\nin SA 1200 and deceived the Elven-smiths, who began forging the Rings of\nPower under his instruction in SA 1500. Sauron forged the One Ring to\nrule the others around SA 1600, and Celebrimbor hid from him the Three\nElven Rings of power that he had made without Sauron knowing of its\ncreation and help. Enraged, Sauron attacked Eregion in SA 1697.\n\nCeleborn led a sortie from Eregion to meet the vanguard of Sauron's\narmy. He was able to drive the enemy back long enough to join forces\nwith Elrond, who brought reinforcements from Lindon. But Sauron's army\nwas greater than their combined forces and Eregion soon fell.\nCelebrimbor was killed, and Sauron took the Nine Rings and at least six\nof the Seven rings. Sauron would eventually be driven back to Mordor in\nSA 1701.\n\nThe movements of Celeborn and Galadriel after the fall of Eregion are\nunclear. Celeborn may have gone to Lothlórien to help strengthen their\ndefenses against Sauron. He and Galadriel may have lived there for a\ntime, but they did not become the rulers of Lothlórien then. The king of\nLothlórien at that time was Amdír, who was killed in the War of the Last\nAlliance at the end of the Second Age and was succeeded by his son\nAmroth.\n\nThird Age\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel may also have lived for a while in Rivendell, the\nhome of Elrond. At some point, they may have travelled to the coastal\nregion of Belfalas in the south to be near the sea.\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel's daughter Celebrian married Elrond in TA 109.\nElrond and Celebrian had three children: twin sons Elladan and Elrohir,\nborn in TA 130, and a daughter Arwen, born in TA 241.\n\nAround TA 1050, the Necromancer, who was actually Sauron, built the\nstronghold of Dol Guldur across the Anduin from Lothlórien. Celeborn and\nGaladriel are said to have returned to Lothlórien to investigate the\nNecromancer and ensure the safety of Lothlórien. But after a time, they\nonce again departed, possibly for Rivendell. Lothlórien remained under\nthe rule of King Amroth.\n\nA Balrog awoke in Khazad-dum in TA 1980. Many of the Elves of Lothlórien\nfled, including Amroth's lover Nimrodel. Amroth followed Nimrodel and he\nlater perished at sea. Lothlórien was left without a leader, so Celeborn\nand Galadriel returned there and became the Lord and Lady of Lothlórien\nin TA 1981. They ruled the realm from Caras Galadhon, the City of the\nTrees.\n\nCelebrian was on her way to Lothlórien to visit her parents in TA 2509\nwhen she was captured by orcs in Caradhras. Her sons Elladan and Elrohir\nrescued Celebrian, but the horror of the experience remained with her\nand she decided to leave Middle-earth the next year to dwell in the\nUndying Lands.\n\nIn TA 2941, Sauron was driven out of Dol Guldur by the White Council -\nof which Galadriel was a member. However, Sauron had been prepared for\nthe attack and returned to Mordor. He sent Nazgûl led by Khamul to\noccupy Dol Guldur.\n\nAragorn came to Lothlórien in TA 2980 and became betrothed to Arwen, who\nwas there visiting her grandparents.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nIn December of 3018, Elladan and Elrohir brought word to Celeborn and\nGaladriel of the Fellowship of the Ring's quest to destroy the One Ring.\nThe Fellowship arrived in Lothlórien on January 15, 3019, and was\nbrought to Caras Galadhon to meet Celeborn and Galadriel on January 17.\n\n\n\nCeleborn at first welcomed Gimli despite his distrust of Dwarves and\nsaid he hoped that there could be friendship between their peoples once\nmore. Then he  learned that the Balrog had been disturbed by an\nexpedition of Dwarves to Khazad-dum led by Balin several years before,\nand that the Balrog had attacked the Fellowship resulting in the loss of\nGandalf the Grey. Celeborn was angry at first and regretted allowing the\nFellowship to enter Lothlórien, but Galadriel soothed him and he\napologized to Gimli.\n\nCeleborn promised to help the Fellowship in any way he could. On the eve\nof the Fellowship's departure from Lothlórien, he discussed what route\nthey might take, and offered them boats to ease their journey down the\nAnduin. The next day on February 16, Celeborn and Galadriel prepared a\nfeast for the Fellowship and gave them gifts. Celeborn gave them further\nadvice about navigating the Great River Anduin.\n\n\n\nLothlórien was attacked thrice by forces from Dol Guldur during the War\nof the Ring: on March 11, 15, and 22. Each time, the Galadhrim led by\nCeleborn and Galadriel repelled them. After the destruction of the One\nRing and Sauron's defeat, Celeborn led a force across the Anduin and\ncaptured Dol Guldur on March 28. The shadow was lifted from Mirkwood.\n\nOn April 6, Celeborn met Thranduil, the King of the Woodland Realm, in\nMirkwood. They renamed the forest the Wood of Greenleaves. Thranduil\nretained kingship of the northern part of the forest, while the center\npart was given to the Beornings and the Woodmen. Celeborn claimed the\nsouthern part of the forest below the Narrows of the Forest to be part\nof Lothlórien. This region was named East Lórien.\n\nCeleborn and Galadriel accompanied their granddaughter Arwen to Minas\nTirith, where she wed Aragorn on Midyear's Day. Celeborn and Galadriel\nthen travelled to Rohan and attended the funeral of the King Theoden. On\nthe way home, they met with Treebeard at Isengard.\n\nWhen Celeborn and Galadriel parted from Aragorn, Celeborn said to his\ngranddaughter's husband: _“Kinsman, farewell! May your doom be other\nthan mine, and your treasure remain with you to the end!”_\n\nCeleborn may have been anticipating the day when his own wife would\ndepart for the Undying Lands while he remained in Middle-earth. On\nSeptember 13, Celeborn and Galadriel crossed the Redhorn Gate to return\nto Lothlórien.\n\nFourth Age\n\n\n\nGaladriel left Middle-earth to return to the Undying Lands in 3021 at\nthe end of the Third Age. Celeborn remained in Lothlórien, but after a\nfew years he began to grow weary. He went to Rivendell to live with his\ngrandsons Elladan and Elrohir for awhile in the early part of the Fourth\nAge. Eventually, Celeborn went to the Grey Havens and sailed for the\nUndying Lands where his wife and daughter dwelled. It is said that “with\nhim went the last living memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth.”\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _CELEBORN_ means “Silver tree”, from the Sindarin words _celeb_\n(“silver”) and _orn_ (“tree”). His original name was TELEPORNO, a\nTelerin name which means “Silver-high”, from Quenyan _tyelpe_\n(“silver”).\n\n\nPronunciation\n\nCeleborn is pronounced ‘Keleborn’ and not ‘Seleborn’.",

She lived with her mother\nGaladriel in Eregion, and later fled to Lórinand sometime between SA\n1350 and SA 1400. After a time, Galadriel and Celebrían passed through\nMoria and dwelt in Rivendell. There, she met Elrond who loved her,\nthough he said nothing about it.\n\nIn TA 109, Elrond wedded Celebrían. She bore him twin sons, Elladan and\nElrohir in TA 130, and then a daughter, Arwen in TA 241.\n\nIn TA 2509, Celebrían was on her way to visit her parents in Lothlórien\nwhen she was waylaid by Orcs in the Redhorn Pass of the Misty Mountains.\nShe was then tormented by the orcs and received a poisoned wound. Her\nsons arrived much later to rescue her, and Elrond to heal her, but\nCelebrían was never fully-healed in mind and spirit. Horrified and\nhaunted by the fearful memories of her torture, she no longer desired to\nremain on Middle-earth, and sailed west the next year in the TA 2510.\n\n\nLater mentions\n\nThere are several references of Celebrían in _The Lord of the Rings_,\nsuch as the mention of her torment and being the daughter of\nGaladriel.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name CELEBRÍAN means “Silver queen”, from the Sindarin words\n_celeb_ (“silver”) and _rían_ (“queen”).\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn earlier writings, Amroth the King of Lothlórien was the son of\nCeleborn and Galadriel, and the brother of Celebrían. It was said that\nGaladriel fled with Amroth and Celebrían to Lothlórien. When Galadriel\nand Celebrían left for Rivendell, Amroth was left in the forest, and\nwould later visit his family when they lived in Dol Amroth.\n\nIn other versions, Celebrían wedded Elrond in TA 2500, but in TA 2600,\nshe was slain (not captured) by the Orcs in the Misty Mountains. Her\nchildren were Elladan and Elrohir, and Finduilas (later Arwen).\n\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nTolkien has said that “after the destruction of the Ruling Ring the\nThree Rings of the Eldar lost their virtue. Then Elrond prepared at last\nto depart from Middle-earth and follow Celebrían.” Thus it passed\nthat after 500 long years, at the Haven of Avallonë in Tol Eressëa,\nElrond and Celebrían were finally reunited, sometime after TA 3021 (the\nRing-bearer sailing on September 29, 3021).

    "text": "CELEBRIMBOR was a Ñoldorin prince, and the last in the line of the House\nof Fëanor, who lived in Middle-earth. He was a ruler of Eregion in the\nSecond Age, and a master smith. He is remembered primarily for his\ncreation of the three greatest Elven Rings of Power: Vilya, Narya, and\nNenya.\n\n\nBiography\n\nFirst Age\n\n\n\nCelebrimbor was the son of Curufin, who was the fifth son of Fëanor (son\nof Finwë and his first wife Miriel) and Nerdanel. During the First\nAge, he lived with his father in Nargothrond, but took no part in the\ndeeds of Curufin and Celegorm regarding Lúthien, Beren, and Finrod. He\nin fact repudiated his father's deeds, and did not follow his father and\nuncle when they were expelled from Nargothrond.\n\nSecond Age\n\n\n\nCelebrimbor settled in Eregion in the Second Age and started dealing\nwith the Dwarves of the realm of Khazad-dûm. In SA 1500, Sauron, calling\nhimself _Annatar_ (“Lord of Gifts”), befriended the Ñoldor of Eregion.\nHe claimed to be an emissary of the Valar, especially Aulë, and\ninstructed them in the art of ring-making. Celebrimbor distrusted\nhim, but the smiths of Eregion were deceived. Under the guidance and\ninstruction of Sauron, the smiths openly made rings to learn the craft,\nbut unknown to them the craft taught by Sauron incorporated a binding\nmagic into the rings.\n\nIn secret, Sauron forged the One Ring, a master ring that would rule all\nthe lesser rings, to enable him to rule Middle-earth via its influence\nover those who used the other rings. When Sauron placed the One Ring on\nhis finger, claiming dominance over all the Rings of Power and their\nbearers, the elves knew his true identity and intentions. Celebrimbor\nand the elves of Eregion defied Sauron by withholding the other rings\nfrom him. The greatest of the rings (aside from the One Ring) were\ncreated by Celebrimbor himself, and these were never touched by Sauron\nand thus were uncorrupted by him, although they were still subject to\nthe One Ring. These were the three Rings of the Elves, the fairest of\nthe Rings of Power. Celebrimbor named them Vilya, Narya, and Nenya after\nthe principal Middle-earth elements of air, fire and water,\nrespectively. He sent the three rings away for safekeeping: Vilya and\nNarya to Gil-galad in Lindon; and Nenya to Galadriel in Lórien.\n\n\n\nSauron retaliated by attacking Eregion, laying waste to the realm.\nCelebrimbor was captured in the chaos and was forced, under torture, to\ndisclose where the lesser rings were, but he would not reveal the\nwhereabouts of the three greatest of them that he had sent away for\nsafekeeping. Celebrimbor died from his torment; his body was shot with\narrows and hung upon a pole, and was later paraded as a banner as Sauron\nattacked the elves. He was the last direct descendant of the line of\nFëanor, save perhaps for his father's brother Maglor, whose fate is\nunknown and is said by some legends to still wander the shores of the\nSea. It is unknown if he married or not or if he had children or not.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis father-name was TELPERINQUAR, which means “Silver-fist” or “Hand of\nsilver” in Quenya. It comes from the words _telpë_ (“silver”) and _quár_\n(“fist”). His mother-name remains unknown. The name CELEBRIMBOR is the\nSindarin translation of his father-name, which comes from _celeb_\n(“silver”) and _baur_ (“fist”).\n\n\nCharacter\n\nUnlike both his father and his grandfather, Celebrimbor was portrayed as\nbeing both selfless and kind, and was neither prideful nor covetous of\nthat which he created. He was described to have an “almost Dwarvish\nobsession with crafts”; he became a famous artificer and smith in\nboth Gondolin and Eregion. His love for crafts took him to Eregion,\nwhere he was introduced to a precious metal and called it Mithril.\nMithril was mined by Dwarves in their nearby Mine Realm of Khazad-dum,\nalso named Moria. Great friendship with the Dwarves of Moria developed,\nskills and secrets were shared between the two peoples for many years\nvia The High Road which was built between the two realms. But a long\nperiod of peace would not last, for upon realizing the trap which Sauron\nhad devised for him, Celebrimbor was filled with anxiety and fear for\nhis people, and was later described as the heroic defender of\nEregion.\n\n\nImportant Works\n\n\n\n-   Rings of Power\n    -   The Nine Rings of Men (with Annatar)\n    -   The Seven Rings of the Dwarves (with Annatar)\n    -   The Three Rings of the Elves\n-   Doors of Durin (with Narvi) \n\n\nOther forms of the legendarium\n\nIn some accounts, Celebrimbor was a Sindar elf, an ancestor of Daeron,\nwho used Feanorian scripts.\n\nLater, Celebrimbor was changed and became of Ñoldorin origin, and a\nsurvivor of the Fall of Gondolin. In the _Unfinished Tales_, a\nstatement claims Celebrimbor to be one of the Teleri who accompanied\nCeleborn to exile.\n\nAnother version of the story has Celebrimbor revolt against Galadriel,\nafter Galadriel and Celeborn established Eregion . Celebrimbor and\nGaladriel were later reconciled once Sauron's trickery was revealed.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptions\n\nVideo games\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrimbor appears in the video games _Middle-earth: Shadow of\nMordor_and _Middle-earth: Shadow of War_, as the wraith assisting the\nranger Talion in destroying the forces of Sauron. Developers have\nrevealed that he assists Talion due to the guilt he feels for creating\nthe Rings of Power, and thus he feels ultimately responsible for the\ntrouble Middle-earth is in. However, the Celebrimbor that appears in the\ngame differs from the Tolkien Celebrimbor in that he not only makes the\nthree Elf rings, but he crafts all of the Rings of Power, and when\ncaptured helps Sauron reforge the One Ring (via the inscription of the\nlettering of the Ring upon it) and assists him in creating the Nazgul by\naccompanying Sauron to the men who eventually would become the Nine; he\nalso gave the Ring a will of its own. However, once Sauron's intentions\nwere revealed to him, he stole the One Ring and used it to command an\narmy of orcs and Uruks to fight Sauron and lay claim over Mordor. In a\nfinal battle, Celebrimbor used the Ring's power of invisibility to\ndefeat Sauron. However the ring wanted to return to the Dark Lord, and\nso it slipped off of Celebrimbor's finger and onto Sauron's, breaking\nCelebrimbor's control over his orc army. Captured by Sauron, the elf was\nthen tortured as punishment, such as witnessing his family tortured and\nkilled in front of him, before finally being beaten to death with his\nown Mithril hammer by Sauron.\n\n\n\nWhen the game takes place and the protagonist, Talion, is slain in a\nblood-ritual, Celebrimbor is bound to the ranger, which allows Talion to\nreturn from the dead (in addition to many other abilities). He has no\nmemory of his past, not even remembering his own name until they find an\nartifact that belonged to him (with the assistance of Gollum,) and with\neach artifact they find more of his memory is restored. Gollum\neventually abandons them, leaving them to find the last artifact in Udûn\non their own. They also assist a low ranking captain named Ratbag\nadvance through the ranks until he advances to Warchief, and kill all\nother warchiefs (leaving Ratbag in charge of all the uruks in Udûn),\nwhich leads to his demise after he is blamed for failing to prevent the\ndestruction of a monument to Sauron by the Hammer of Sauron, a Black\nCaptain and a lieutenant of the Black Hand of Sauron (the leader of the\nuruks in Sauron's stead). Talion (and Celebrimbor) is approached by\nLithariel, the daughter of the Queen of the Tribesmen of Núrnen, who\nclaims her mother has summoned Talion to her chambers.\n\nTheir job finished in Udûn, they make their way to Núrnen and have an\naudience with Queen Marwen (who looks similar to King Théoden when he\nwas enchanted by Saruman), who gives them another artifact from\nCelebrimbor's past.\n\nThis artifact gives the wraith and his host their key to confronting the\nBlack Hand: branding. They begin building their army by branding the\ncaptains and warchiefs of Núrnen (and optionally Udûn), thus enabling\nthem to confront the Black Hand at his fortress of Ered Glamhoth, the\nstrength of his forces depending on how many warchiefs and captains he\nbranded. They return to the queen to tell her they are prepared to leave\nwhen suddenly the Queen begins forcing Celebrimbor out of Talion, saying\nthat they can defeat Sauron “together.” As Talion dies, he tells\nLithariel, Marwen's daughter, to break the Queen's staff, and when it\nbreaks, the Queen becomes youthful again, and reveals she went to the\nIstari Saruman for assistance in helping her people survive Sauron's\nonslaught. Celebrimbor suspects that Saruman may have gone rogue, and\nmay be desiring the One for himself. Marwen nonetheless assists Talion\nby acquiring them a smuggler, which they use to go to the Black Hand's\nfortress.\n\nWhen Talion enters the fortress, a skeleton bound to a pole by rope\nbegins talking directly to Talion, and Celebrimbor reveals that the\nTower of Sauron, another Black Captain and the Black Hand's right hand,\nis responsible for this, and thus is here in the Black Hand's stead.\nTalion approaches the Black Hand's throne, and as he looks for the\nTower, the Black Captain appears in the throne, and reveals the Black\nHand went looking for Talion. He addresses Celebrimbor directly, telling\nhim Sauron forgives him and, if he casts off that “corpse” and becomes\none with him, he will have his dreams fulfilled. Celebrimbor rebukes the\nTower, saying that Talion and the wraith will never surrender.\n\nFailing to deceive Celebrimbor, he reveals to Talion that the Ringmaker\ndeceived Talion by pretending that the Black Hand of Sauron placed a\ncurse on them, binding them together, where in reality Cerebrimbor chose\nTalion as his “host” and could have released him at any time. Talion\ninsists that the Tower stand up and fight, to which the Tower obliges.\nHe creates illusions of himself, forcing Talion to drain the illusions\nto sap the Tower of his power.\n\nAfter the illusions are eliminated, Talion hears his wife Ioreth\nsinging, and when he gets close to her, his wife is revealed as the\nTower, who attempts to brand Talion. However, the ranger overpowers him\nand brutally kills him, stabbing him with his son's dagger, Acharn, four\ntimes in the heart, before shoving his sword, Urafel, into the Tower's\nlaughing mouth. After the Tower's death, Talion reveals his anger at\nCelebrimbor for his deceit, saying he wanted to be with his wife and son\ninstead of being alone alive. Celebrimbor points out though that the\nranger wanted revenge, and thus he gave him the means to do so. The\nRingmaker does admit that he can leave Talion, if he wants. Yet before\nthey can part ways, the wraith says that they must finish what they\nstarted by killing their true target: the Black Hand. Talion reluctantly\nagrees, and the pair set sail for Núrnen once more.\n\nHowever, they find the Queen's palace sacked, and blood on the throne.\nThe queen's crown, however, was left, and when Talion picks it up,\nanother set of Celebrimbor's memories are returned to him. They figure\nthe Black Hand has them in Udûn, preparing an exchange for Celebrimbor\nfor the Queen and her daughter. They arrive in the now-dark, ashed\nfilled Udûn, where they find the Black Hand's elite guards standing\nwatch for the duo. When the Talion arrives at the Black Gate riding a\nCaragor, his branded Uruks and warchiefs are already fighting the rank\nand file Uruks. Then finally, with a warchief and a set of captains, the\nTalons of the Black Hand reveal themselves, along with a host of rank\nand file uruks. To Talion's sadness, The Talons reveal that they\nslaughtered all of the Núrnen tribesman, including Lithariel and Queen\nMarwen. After a brutal fight, the Talons are defeated, and the remaining\nbranded Uruks that assisted Talion remain behind to fight the Black\nHand's forces. Meanwhile, the Gravewalker climbs the Black Gate, and\nfind the Black Hand waiting for him. Then quite subtly, the Black\nCaptain lures the wraith duo in and unleashes a blast of energy that\ngives Celebrimbor more of his memories: his confrontation with Sauron in\nthe fields of Udûn ending in failure, the return of Sauron's ring, and\nthe brutal murders of Celebrimbor's family before his eyes, before being\nmurdered himself. This gives Celebrimbor more power as a result. The\nBlack Hand tells Celebrimbor that when he originally performed the blood\nritual in an attempt to absorb his spirit into the Black Hand's\ncorporeal form (thus reforming an avatar of Sauron, though he would not\nbe at full strength), he gave him a choice: to stand by Sauron's side.\nHe then tells the gravewalker duo that Talion and Celebrimbor have no\nchoice in the matter, and surprisingly performs the blood ritual on\nhimself, absorbing Celebrimbor into the Black Hand and forming the\navatar of Sauron. Sauron tries to kill the already dying Talion, but as\nSauron is about to deliver the finishing blow, Celebrimbor uses his\nenergy to temporarily stun Sauron. This gives Talion the chance he\nneeded to kill the avatar of Sauron, and thus the Black Hand, with his\nsword.\n\nTalion relieved that he has finally exacted vengeance for his family,\nsees Celebrimbor waiting, ready to go to the afterlife together. Talion,\nhowever, insists that together they should use their powers to combat\nSauron, because they both know as long as his Ring exists, he will\nreturn again, no matter in what form. Celebrimbor insists that fighting\nSauron is mortally impossible, because he tried once long ago and it\ncouldn't be done. Talion asks the Ringmaker if he could die knowing\nthere was chance that they could defeat Sauron, but they didn't take it.\nCelebrimbor simply disappears, and doesn't answer. Talion, looking at\nUdûn's red sun, declares to himself and the wraith that it's time for\nthem to forge new ring, as his eyes glow with the wraith's power.\n\nThe two then travel to Mount Doom, and proceed to forge a new ring. Upon\nit's completion, Celebrimbor is separated from Talion by Shelob, and\nTalion takes the new ring to survive without the wraith. He later finds\nhim in Shelob's lair within Cirith Ungol, and gives her the new ring in\nexchange for Celebrimbor. The elven wraith dislikes this exchange\nhowever, but Shelob's natural powers amplified by the ring prove to be\ntoo strong to fight, and thus the duo shifts their attention to a new\ntarget; The Palantíri in Minas Ithil.\n\nAfter the city's eventual fall, Sauron sends 8 ringwraiths to force the\nnew ring from Shelob. Realizing the danger that keeping the ring would\ncause to both her and to Middle-earth, she returns the ring to it's\nforgers. The ranger and the wraith then proceed to Nurnen, where they\nuse the ring's power to build an army and take over the region;\nSubsequently, they are betrayed by an ally in the process, only to exact\nrevenge on him with utter cruelty. Of course, Celebrimbor's cruelty\nhints to Talion that the ring's power is starting to affect the elf's\nsanity.\n\n\n\nEventually, after conquering most of Sauron's domain, defeating a Balrog\nwith the help of Carnan, a nature spirit, and finding out the identities\nof some of the Nazgul, the duo takes their army and march towards\nBarad-dûr, only to be stopped by one of the ringwraiths, Isildur. Upon\nhis defeat, Talion decides to end the fallen hero's torment, and\npermanently kills him. However, Celebrimbor considers this an act of\nbetrayal; he reveals that his plan has gone from simple revenge to\ntyranny, as he plans on brainwashing Sauron and ruling Middle-earth\nthrough him. As Talion objects to this plan, the wraith abandons the\nranger's body and takes over Eltariel's, leaving Talion to bleed to\ndeath.\n\nAs Talion picks up Isildur's ring, he becomes a ringwraith and decided\nto take back Minas Morgul, whilst Celebrimbor and his new host face\nSauron. Eventually, Sauron, in his Annatar form, finds himself on his\nknees, and Celebrimbor begins to brand him. Sauron pulls out a blade and\nslices off Eltariel's fingers, just like Isildur had done to him\ncenturies earlier. With Sauron now having the upper hand, he consumes\nthe wraith, but with adverse effects; they both become the flaming eye\nof Sauron, locked into a battle off wills. The two fought until the One\nRing was destroyed in the War of the Ring, wherein the Dark Lord Sauron\nwas finally defeated.\n\nHowever, Celebrimbor did not fade from middle-earth as Sauron did, for,\nlike Sauron, he had poured his own life force into his own ring. Thus,\nCelebrimbor was freed and the New Ring, now worn by the Elven assassin\nEltariel, started expressing a desire to return to it's creator...\n\nCelebrimbor is voiced by Alastair Duncan.",

He is\nsomewhat anomalously described as having fair hair, rather than the\nblack or red hair of his parents and his six siblings.\n\nCelegorm was a great huntsman, and a friend of the Vala Oromë. From\nOromë he learned great skill of birds and beasts, and could understand a\nnumber of their languages. He had brought with him from Valinor the\ngreat hound Huan, a gift from Oromë.\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\nCelegorm was born in Valinor sometime during the Noontide of Valinor. He\nwas very close to Oromë and probably hunted with him in his woods.\n\nAfter the theft of the Silmarils and the death of their grandfather, he\nand his father and his brothers took an oath to recover them at any\ncost. Celegorm, bound to his oath came to Middle-earth and established\ngreat realms in exile and joined with their relatives in the House of\nFingolfin, and waged war against the armies of Morgoth. Celegorm\nand his brother were great lords in the land of Himlad. They were\ndefeated and overwhelmed by the successful sudden assault of Morgoth\nduring the Dagor Bragollach. Celegorm and Curufin lost Himlad and fled\nsouth to the marches of Doriath. Not being welcome there due to the\nKinslaying at Alqualondë, Celegorm, Curufin, and their people settled in\nNargothrond.\n\nWhile he and his brother lived in Nargothrond, they captured Lúthien\nTinúviel, daughter of King Thingol of Doriath. Celegorm wished to marry\nher, thus forcing a bond of kinship with Thingol. Huan, however, broke\nwith his master and helped Lúthien escape, foiling his scheme.\nAfterwards, he and his brother were expelled from Nargothrond.\nCelegorm fell at Menegroth in the Second Kinslaying when the Sons of\nFëanor attacked Doriath to seize a Silmaril in the possession of King\nDior of Doriath. Dior and Celegorm slew each other in the halls of\nMenegroth.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nHis father-name was TURCAFINWË (“Strong  Finwë). His\nmother-name was TYELKORMO (”Hasty-riser“), from the Quenya word _tyelka_\n(”hasty\"), possibly in references to his quick temper and habit of\nleaping when angered.\n\n\nGallery",
