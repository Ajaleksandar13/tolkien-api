    "text": "The “DRAGON-SPELL” is a power possessed by Dragons that allows them to\nhypnotize their victims for various purposes.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Dragon-spell power is known to have originated with Glaurung, the\nfirst dragon, who employed it against Túrin and others.\n\n\nApplications\n\nAs with much of tolkiens work, little detail is given into the limits\nand uses of this power. Glaurung is known to have used it against Túrin\n, using it to paralyze him, preventing him from acting despite hundreds\nof people being dragged away. He also used it to influence Túrin ,\nmaking him think Niënor was suffering despite being perfectly fine.\nGlaurung would also use it to induce total amnesia in Niënor, and later\nreturning all her memories to her, all with words.\n\nSmaug would also use an ability similar to this. Bilbo would notice a\nbeam of light coming from smaug's eyes (likely due to his senses being\nenhanced by the ring). Whenever this beam passed over bilbo he would\nhave a strong desire to remove the one ring from his fingers."
