He also used it while entering into Mordor to\ndefend himself from the spider Shelob. When Shelob first approached, Sam\nreminded him of the “star-glass” and its light drove her away. Frodo\ngave the light to Sam to hold while he cut through Shelob's webbing and\nSam wielded it when he attacked Shelob to rescue Frodo. The star-glass\nshone particularly bright in response to his indomitable spirit. He used\nit twice to get past the Two Watchers who guarded the tower of Cirith\nUngol; the second time the phial shone out lightning-bright in tribute\nto his hardiness and faithfulness.\n\n\n\nSam also attempted to use the light in the Crack of Doom but the light\nwas subdued by the power of the heart of Sauron's realm. The light was\none of the items found on him when he and Frodo were rescued by the\nEagles; Gandalf kept both it and Sam's box of Earth from Galadriel safe\nwhile the two hobbits were being healed after their collapse on the side\nof Mount Doom.\nThe Phial of Galadriel seemed to inspire its bearers to call out to\nElbereth, who is also known as Varda, as both Frodo and Sam call out in\nElvish. Frodo also cries out “aiya Eärendil elenion ancalima!” the first\ntime he uses it against Shelob. Although Frodo did not understand these\nwords, they were in reference to Eärendil, and they translate as “hail\nEärendil, brightest of stars!” from Quenya.\n\nAt the end of the Third Age, the Light of Earendil went to the Uttermost\nWest with Frodo.\n",

Sam, Merry, and Pippin kept their swords. The\nBarrow-blades carried by Merry and Pippin were taken and discarded when\nthe two hobbits were captured by Uruk-hai at Amon Hen, but Aragorn saved\nthem and they were returned when they were reunited at Isengard. Merry's\nBarrow-blade played a major role in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.\nIt was enchanted with the power to harm the Witch-king of Angmar himself\nby a weaponsmith of Arthedain long before. When he stabbed the\nWitch-king in the knee with it, it distracted the Nazgûl and broke the\nspell binding his undead flesh to his will, allowing Eowyn to kill him\nby driving her sword into his unseen head, thus fulfilling the prophesy\nof Glorfindel that “not by the hand of man shall he fall.” Merry's\nBarrow-blade then burned away, a fate common to weapons brought into\ncontact with the Witch-king. The sword is approximately 30 inches long,\nso as to be wielded by Hobbit-folk.\n\nPippin also used his Barrow-blade to kill a Troll at the Battle of the\nBlack Gate, and afterwards refers to it as a Troll's bane. He later\nwielded this Barrow-blade during the Scouring of the Shire. Sam left his\nsword with Frodo after presuming him dead from an encounter with Shelob,\nand it was later taken from Frodo's body by Shagrat and delivered to\nBarad-dûr with Frodo's Mithril coat.

He gave it to\nIdril which she bore upon her breast during the fall of Gondolin,\naccounting for its escape, and in turn she gave it to her son Eärendil,\nwho bore it upon his breast on his flight to the Undying Lands.\n\nTwo versions are hereafter recorded as to the fate of the stone.\n\n-   Olorin brings the stone to Middle-earth as a sign that the Valar had\n    not forsaken Middle-earth. He gave it to Galadriel but he prophesied\n    that, “...it is not for you to possess. You shall hand it on when\n    the time comes.
