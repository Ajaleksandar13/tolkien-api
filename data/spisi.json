    "text": "_THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING_ is the first of three volumes of\nthe novel _The Lord of the Rings_. It is divided into two books, Book I\nand II. It was originally released on July 29, 1954 in the United\nKingdom by Allen and Unwin.\n\n\nPrologue\n\nThe book begins with a prologue, which summarizes the events of the\nfirst book, _The Hobbit_. It gives you the backstory of the ring and how\nit came to be. It tells how the creator, Sauron first came upon it. It\ngives the backstory of Sméagol and his friend Déagol and how they came\nupon the Ring after Sauron was temporarily defeated. It also explains\nhow Bilbo Baggins found the One Ring after Sméagol, who had become\nGollum, lost it. Then Bilbo returns to Bag End in The Shire, and the\nstory of Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's nephew, begins.\n\nParts\n\n-   '''I- '''Concerning Hobbits\n-   '''II- '''Concerning Pipe-Weed\n-   '''III- '''Of the Ordering of the Shire\n-   IV- Of the Finding of the Ring\n-   V- Note on the Shire Records\n\n\nBook I: The First Journey / The Ring Sets Out\n\n The first sets the stage\nfor the adventure and follows Frodo Baggins as he flees from his home in\nthe Shire to escape the minions of the Dark Lord Sauron. Sauron seeks\nthe One Ring that will allow him to control the Bearers of the nineteen\nother Rings and control the three major races of Middle-earth: Elves,\nMen, and Dwarves. The One Ring has been inherited by Frodo who finds\nhimself unwittingly in the midst of a struggle for world domination.\n\nThe first chapter in the book begins quite lightly, following on from\n_The Hobbit_ which is more of a whimsical children's story than _The\nLord of the Rings_. It begins with Bilbo celebrating his 111th (or\neleventy first, as it is called) birthday, on the same day that Frodo\ncelebrates his 33rd birthday (his 'coming of age'). At the birthday\nparty, Bilbo disappears after his speech, to the surprise of all. Frodo\nlater learns about the ring which he had used to make himself invisible,\nand also about some of its darker powers.\n\nHeeding the advice of the wizard Gandalf, Frodo leaves his home, taking\nthe Ring with him. He hopes to reach Rivendell, where he will be safe\nfrom Sauron, and where those wiser than he can decide what to do about\nthe Ring.\n\nIn his journey he is accompanied by three hobbit friends, Peregrin Took,\nMeriadoc Brandybuck and Samwise Gamgee, often refered to as Merry,\nPippin and Sam. From the start they are pursued by Black Riders, the\nRingwraiths who serve Sauron. Narrowly escaping these and other dangers\nand meeting other interesting characters en route (e.g., Tom Bombadil)\nthey eventually come to Bree, where they meet Strider, another friend of\nGandalf who leads them the rest of the way to Rivendell, through further\nhardships. Frodo is stabbed upon the mountain of Weathertop by the chief\nof the Nazgûl with a 'Morgul blade' - as part of the knife stays inside\nhim, he gets sicker on the rest of the journey. They also pass the\ntrolls which had been turned to stone in the previous book, _The\nHobbit_.\n\nChapters\n\n-   I - A LONG-EXPECTED PARTY - details Bilbo and Frodo's Birthday\n    Party; chapter ends with Bilbo leaving the\n    Shire.\n-   II - THE SHADOW OF THE PAST - Gandalf tells Frodo the true nature of\n    the ring, and how it must be taken to Mordor and destroyed. Sam, who\n    has been listening at the window, is told to accompany Frodo.\n-   III - THREE IS COMPANY - Frodo sells Bag End, and officially is\n    going to move to a house at Crickhollow in the area beyond\n    Bucklebury in Buckland; he actually plans to disappear without\n    causing too much of a fuss. Frodo, Sam and Pippin set out through\n    the South Farthing of the Shire towards Buckland, and encounter a\n    black rider. They also meet Gildor the wood elf, with other wood\n    elves.\n-   IV - A SHORT CUT TO MUSHROOMS - They meet Farmer Maggot while taking\n    a short cut, and he gives them some of his prized mushrooms. Merry\n    joins them at the end.\n-   V - A CONSPIRACY UNMASKED - Takes place at Frodo's new house at\n    Crickhollow. The title refers to Frodo about to tell Merry and\n    Pippin about his quest, who he had previously believed not to know\n    about it, and they tell him that they had known much of it all\n    along. They also meet Fatty Bolger. Frodo decides to leave the next\n    day through the Old Forest, as it is an unexpected direction, rather\n    than travelling on the roads.\n-   VI - THE OLD FOREST - Although trying to avoid it, the hobbits get\n    lost and travel to the River Withywindle, the “queerest part of the\n    whole wood”. Merry and Pippin are trapped inside Old Man Willow, and\n    are freed only when Tom Bombadil arrives.\n-   VII - IN THE HOUSE OF TOM BOMBADIL - Tom knows much about the\n    hobbits, and even tries on the Ring, yet it does not have any effect\n    on him - it doesn't even make him invisible. Frodo tries on the ring\n    then to see if it 'works', and Tom Bombadil is also able to see\n    Frodo while he has the ring on.\n-   VIII - FOG ON THE BARROW-DOWNS - Travelling through the\n    Barrow-downs, the hobbits are imprisoned by Barrow-wights, where\n    they are rescued again by Tom Bombadil. The hobbits are given\n    daggers from the treasure in one of the downs.\n-   IX - AT THE SIGN OF THE PRANCING PONY - The hobbits reach the The\n    Prancing Pony inn at Bree, where Frodo uses a false name, Underhill.\n    Later, after singing a song on a table, he trips and accidentally\n    puts the ring on his finger, disappearing, which causes a commotion.\n-   X - STRIDER - Strider, who had at first seemed menacing, turns out\n    to be friendly. The innkeeper, Butterbur, gives Frodo a late letter\n    from Gandalf, which tells him that Strider is a friend of Gandalf's\n    whose real name is Aragorn.\n-   XI - A KNIFE IN THE DARK - The hobbits with Strider set out from\n    Bree on foot after their horses had bolted when Black Riders arrived\n    at the inn at night. The Riders had attacked the beds which they\n    were supposed to be staying in, though in vain as Strider had them\n    stay in another room. They buy a pony from Bill Ferny. They pass\n    through the Midgewater Marshes, and reach Weathertop. There they are\n    attacked by five Black Riders; Frodo puts on the ring to escape\n    them, and is stabbed in the shoulder by the Witch-king of Angmar,\n    leader of the nine Ringwraiths (Nazgul).\n-   XII - FLIGHT TO THE FORD - They pass the trolls Bert, Tom and\n    William, which were turned to stone by Gandalf in _The Hobbit_.\n    Eventually, they meet the elf Glorfindel from Rivendell, who allows\n    Frodo to take his white horse to escape the Ringwraiths on their way\n    to Rivendell. The Black Riders are washed away in The Flood over the\n    Ford.\n\n\nBook II: The Journey of the Nine Companions / The Ring Goes South\n\nBook II chronicles Frodo's stay at Rivendell, where a plan is hatched at\nthe Council of Elrond to destroy the Ring in Mordor. Early on Frodo\nmeets his uncle Bilbo, whom he had not seen since he left Hobbiton much\nearlier. Frodo sets forth from Rivendell with nine companions: two Men,\nAragorn and Boromir, son of the Steward of the land of Gondor; an Elven\nprince, Legolas; Frodo's old friend and powerful wizard, Gandalf; Gimli\nthe Dwarf; and Frodo's original three hobbit companions. These Nine\nWalkers were chosen to represent the free races of Middle-earth and as a\nbalance to the Nine Riders. They were also accompanied by Bill the Pony,\nwhom Strider and the Hobbits acquired in Bree as a pack horse. Their\nattempt to cross the Misty Mountains is foiled by heavy snow, so they\nare forced to take a path under the mountains via Moria, an ancient\nDwarf kingdom, now full of Orcs and other evil creatures, such as the\nWatcher in the Water guarding the south gate. Just before escaping\nMoria, Gandalf falls into the abyss while battling a Balrog.\n\nThe remaining eight members of the Fellowship then spend some time in\nthe elf-haven of Lothlórien, where they receive gifts from the Elf-queen\nGaladriel that in many cases prove useful later in the quest. They leave\nLórien by river, but Frodo begins to realize the Ring is having a\nmalevolent effect on some members of the party, especially Boromir, who\ntries to take the ring from Frodo. In the process, Frodo puts on the\nring to escape him. Later Boromir is attacked by orcs while trying to\ndefend Merry and Pippin. This book ends when Frodo and Sam depart\nsecretly for Mordor and the Fellowship of the Ring dissolves.\n\nChapters\n\n-   I - MANY MEETINGS - After awakening from a sleep for four days,\n    Frodo meets Gandalf and Bilbo again, as well as Gloin, the dwarf\n    from _The Hobbit_, Elrond, and others.\n-   II_' - The Council of Elrond_' - A council attended by many people;\n    Gandalf tells the story of his escape from Saruman; they decide that\n    the ring must be destroyed and Frodo offers to take it to Mordor.\n-   III_' - The Ring goes South_' - The nine members of the fellowship\n    travel south through Hollin; they try to take the road over the\n    mountain Caradhras but are forced to turn back.\n-   IV_' - A Journey in the Dark_' - They travel to the gates of Moria,\n    where they have to deal with a creature in the lake in front of it.\n    Gandalf eventually opens the doors by speaking the correct password.\n    They reach the tomb of Balin.\n-   V_' - The Bridge of Khazad-dûm_' - Attacked by Orcs, trolls and a\n    Balrog of Morgoth, they make their way to the bridge in Khazad-dûm,\n    where Gandalf and the balrog fall.\n-   VI_' - Lothlórien_' - The company meets the elves of Lórien. The\n    elves reluctantly agree to let Gimli the dwarf pass. Aragorn takes\n    Frodo to the hill of Cerin Amroth.\n-   VII_' - The Mirror of Galadriel_' - The company meets Celeborn and\n    Galadriel. Frodo is shown the mirror of Galadriel.\n-   VIII_' - Farewell to Lórien_' - The elves give them cloaks, elven\n    bread, and other gifts; they then leave Lórien on boats down the\n    Great River.\n-   IX_' - The Great River_' - they notice Gollum following them down\n    the river on a log; Orc Archers attack the boats; A Winged Nazgûl is\n    seen flying above the Fellowship's boats, and is shot down by\n    Legolas, who fires an arrow at the rider's flying beast; they reach\n    the falls of Rauros, where they must choose between travelling on\n    the east or west bank of the river to pass the falls.\n-   X_' - The Breaking of the Fellowship_' - They arrive at the lawn of\n    Parth Galen; they still face the choice of whether to go east or\n    west; Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, who puts it on to\n    escape him. The rest of the company splits up trying to find Frodo.\n    Sam finds Frodo by the river and they cross it, thereby breaking up\n    the the Fellowship and continuing to Mount Doom on their own.\n\nBehind the events that befall the Ring-bearer and the Fellowship, the\nreader begins to sense an awakening of the true nature of the story.\nThere lurks always an idea of destiny, and in the end, it will be a\nconcatenation of the effects spawned by the nature of Good itself, that\nundoes the greatest Evil. Frodo says of the ring's first slave, Gollum,\n“What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature, when he had a\nchance!” and Gandalf's wise response is\n\n    “Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to\n    strike without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure\n    that he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end,\n    because he began his ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.”\n\n\nNotable Characters\n\n-   Frodo Baggins\n-   Bilbo Baggins\n-   Tom Bombadil\n-   Gandalf\n-   Saruman\n-   Sauron\n-   Samwise Gamgee (Sam)\n-   Meriadoc Brandybuck (Merry)\n-   Peregrin Took (Pippin)\n-   Elrond\n-   Galadriel\n-   Aragorn\n-   Boromir\n-   Gimli\n-   Legolas\n\n+:------------------:+:-------------------------:+:------------------:+\n| Previous novel:    | LORD OF THE RINGS         | Next novel:        |\n| FIRST IN SERIES    | NOVELS                    | THE TWO TOWERS     |\n+--------------------+---------------------------+--------------------+"

    "title": "The Two Towers (novel)",
    "page_id": "88",
    "text": "_For the LPMUD of the same name, see The Two Towers (MUD)._\n\n_THE TWO TOWERS_ is the second novel in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.\n\n\n\n_THE TWO TOWERS_ is the second volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's _The Lord of\nthe Rings_. It is preceded by _The Fellowship of the Ring_ and followed\nby _The Return of the King_.\n\n\nTitle\n\n\n\nTolkien came up with the title under deadline pressure and later\nexpressed dissatisfaction with it. In letters and one sketch, he\nconsidered several possible sets of towers, including Minas Tirith and\nBarad-dûr, and even the possibility of leaving the matter ambiguous.\nHowever, he eventually settled on Orthanc and Minas Morgul and wrote a\nnote to this effect which appears at the end of most editions of _The\nFellowship of the Ring_. He also produced a final cover illustration\nshowing these towers, but the publisher decided not to use it in order\nto save money on the production costs.\n\nLoosely, any pair from a set of six towers in the story could plausibly\nfit the title: Cirith Ungol, Orthanc, Minas Tirith, Barad-dûr, Minas\nMorgul, and the Hornburg.\n\n\nStructure\n\nBecause _The Two Towers_ is the central portion of a longer work, its\nstructure differs from that of a conventional novel. It begins and ends\nabruptly, without introduction to the characters, explanations of major\nplot elements or a satisfying conclusion. The first section follows the\ndivergent paths of several important figures from _The Fellowship of the\nRing_, but tells nothing of its central character, on whose fate so much\ndepends, enabling the reader to share in the suspense and uncertainty of\nthe characters themselves. The narrative of the second part returns to\nthe hero's quest to destroy the evil that threatens the world. While the\nfirst section tells of an epic battle, the struggles in much of the\nsecond are internal.\n\n\nContents\n\nBook III: The Treason of Isengard\n\n\n\nHobbits Merry and Pippin escape from the Orcs who captured them when the\norcs themselves are attacked by the Riders of Rohan. Merry and Pippin\nhead into nearby Fangorn Forest where they encounter treelike giants\ncalled Ents.\n\nThe forest generally keep to themselves, but are moved to oppose the\nmenace posed to the trees by the wizard Saruman, who has been chopping\ndown trees in the forest to fuel fires for his furnaces.\n\nAragorn, Gimli the Dwarf and Legolas the Elf, tracking Merry and Pippin,\ncome across the Riders of Rohan who tell them that they attacked the\norcs the previous night and left no survivors. However, Strider is able\nto find small prints and they follow these into Fangorn, where they meet\na white wizard who they at first believe to be Saruman, but who turns\nout to be their wizard friend Gandalf, whom they believed had perished\nin the mines of Moria. He tells them of his fall into the abyss, his\nbattle to the death with the Balrog and his reawakening. The four ride\nto Edoras and persuade King Théoden that his people are in danger. In\nthe process, Saruman's agent in Edoras, Grima Wormtongue, is expelled\nfrom the city. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas then travel to the defensive\nfortification Helm's Deep while Gandalf goes north in search of\nErkenbrand's men to bring as reinforcements. At Helm's Deep, they resist\nan onslaught of Orcs and Men sent by Saruman, and Gandalf arrives the\nnext morning with the Westfold army led by Erkenbrand just in time. The\nfleeing orcs run into a forest of Huorn half-tree, half-ent creatures\nand none escape. Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Gandalf and the Rohirric army\nthen head to Saruman's stronghold in Isengard.\n\nThere, they reunite with Merry and Pippin and find the city overrun by\nEnts, who have flooded it with the nearby river, and the central tower\nof Orthanc besieged, with Saruman in it. After giving Saruman a chance\nto repent, Gandalf casts him out of the order of wizards. Wormtongue\nthrows something from a window at Gandalf and those with him. This turns\nout to be one of the _palantíri_. Pippin, unable to resist the urge,\nlooks into it and has an encounter with Sauron. Gandalf and Pippin then\nhead for Minas Tirith in preparation for the upcoming war.\n\nChapters\n\n-   I - THE DEPARTURE OF BOROMIR - Aragorn finds Boromir hit with many\n    arrows, who tells him that orcs took Merry and Pippin, and that they\n    were still alive. Boromir dies, and his body is set down the stream\n    on a 'funeral boat'; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli decide to follow the\n    orcs who had captured Merry and Pippin, rather than following Frodo\n    and Sam. The three of them set off to chase the orcs.\n-   II - THE RIDERS OF ROHAN - They follow the trail of the orcs and\n    find several clues as to what happened with the hobbits, then meet a\n    company of Rohirrim led by Éomer, who tell them that the orcs were\n    destroyed and none were left alive. They camp near the site of the\n    orc massacre.\n-   III - THE URUK-HAI - This chapter begins further back in time,\n    telling the story of Merry and Pippin being captured by the orcs,\n    who are led by Ugluk from Saruman's army, and Grishnakh from Mordor.\n    The two sides of orcs are constantly arguing. The orcs camp near\n    Fangorn and Grishnakh attempts to take the hobbits away with him.\n    The hobbits escape as Grishnakh is killed by an arrow. They flee\n    into Fangorn Forest as the men of Rohan attack the orcs.\n-   IV - TREEBEARD - Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard the Ent, who calls\n    an Entmoot, a gathering of Ents in Derndingle. The hobbits meet\n    another ent, Quickbeam. After three days of deliberation, the ents\n    decide at the entmoot to attack Isengard.\n-   V - THE WHITE RIDER - The chapter goes back to the story of Aragorn,\n    Legolas and Gimli, who discover signs that the hobbits escaped the\n    orcs into the forest.

They set off\n    for Edoras.\n-   VI - THE KING OF THE GOLDEN HALL - The four of them reach Edoras and\n    talk with King Theoden. Wormtongue is thrown out of the city.\n    Theoden gives Gandalf the horse Shadowfax.\n-   VII - HELM'S DEEP - Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are at Helm's Deep\n    with the Rohan army, defending the people of Rohan from attack by\n    the army of Saruman.\n-   VIII - THE ROAD TO ISENGARD - They travel to Isengard, and see that\n    it has been destroyed. At Isengard they find Merry and Pippin.\n-   IX - FLOTSAM AND JETSAM - Merry and Pippin tell the story of how the\n    ents attacked Isengard, in amongst the ruins or 'flotsam and jetsam'\n    of the city.\n-   X - THE VOICE OF SARUMAN - Saruman has a very persuasive voice,\n    which he almost uses to persuade Theoden and the others until\n    Gandalf casts him from the order of wizards. Wormtongue throws the\n    Palantír of Orthanc from the tower, which misses Gandalf, and is\n    picked up by Pippin.\n-   XI - THE PALANTIR - Pippin picks up the Palantír and is seen by\n    Sauron. Gandalf explains the origin of the Palantír; Gandalf sets\n    off with Pippin for Minas Tirith, riding on Shadowfax.\n\nBook IV: The Journey of the Ringbearers / The Ring Goes East\n\nFrodo and Sam discover Gollum stalking them as they try to reach Mount\nDoom to destroy the One Ring. Gollum hopes to reclaim the Ring. Sam\nloathes and distrusts him, but Frodo pities him. Gollum promises to lead\nthem to a secret entrance to Mordor and for a time appears to be a true\nally. They first stop at the Black gate of Mordor, where Gollum\npersuades them not to go in, where they would surely have been caught.\nThey head south into Ithilien, and are captured by Faramir, the brother\nof Boromir. Faramir learns from Frodo of his brother's death and the\nplan to destroy the ring, and eventually allows them to go on their way.\nGollum leads them into the lair of Shelob, an enormous spider-like\ncreature, who inflicts her poisonous bite on Frodo. Sam resolves to\nfinish the quest himself and takes the Ring. However, when Orcs take\nFrodo's body, he follows them and learns that Frodo is not dead but\nunconscious and now their prisoner. The last line of the book is “Frodo\nwas alive but taken by the enemy.”\n\nChapters\n\n-   I - THE TAMING OF SMEAGOL - Gollum joins Frodo and Sam, after Sam\n    captures him.\n-   II - THE PASSAGE OF THE MARSHES - They pass through the Dead\n    Marshes.\n-   III - THE BLACK GATE IS CLOSED - They reach the gate of Mordor,\n    Gollum persuades them not to go in, and they head south.\n-   IV - OF HERBS AND STEWED RABBIT - They reach the pleasant country of\n    Ithilien.

    "text": "The Return of the King is the third and final volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's _The Lord of the Rings_, following _The Fellowship of the Ring_ and _The Two Towers_.\n\n\nTitle\n\n\n\nTolkien conceived of _The Lord of the Rings_ as a single volume\ncomprising six sections he called “books” and extensive appendices. The\noriginal publisher made the decision to split the work into three parts,\npublishing the fifth and sixth books and the appendices under the title\n_The Return of the King_, in reference to Aragorn's assumption of the\nthrone. Tolkien indicated he would have preferred _The War of the Ring_\nas a title, as it gave away less of the story.\n\n\nStructure\n\nThe structure of _The Return of the King_ mirrors somewhat that of _The\nTwo Towers_ in that the first section recounts the various adventures of\nseveral characters including a massive battle, and the second section\nresumes the quest of the Ring-bearers.\n\n\nContents\n\nBook V: The War of the Ring\n\nThe story begins as Gandalf delivers news to Denethor, the steward of\nGondor, that war is imminent. Gandalf brings Pippin with him, who enters\nthe service of the steward. Aragorn, by his courage and leadership,\nproves himself a worthy ruler of men. He is destined to find a lost army\nof men now dead yet entrapped in a curse set forth long ago by their own\ndisobedience, in the place known as the Paths of the Dead. The remnants\nof the Fellowship lead the forces of Gondor and Rohan in defence of\nGondor's capital city, Minas Tirith, resulting in the cataclysmic Battle\nof the Pelennor Fields. Those characters who manage to survive the\nbattle are led by Aragorn on an assuredly suicidal feint-attack against\nthe Black Gates of Mordor, partly to distract Sauron from defending his\nother borders so that Frodo and Sam can gain a clear passage into\nMordor. Aragorn's company now surrounds the Black Gates of the Morannon\nexchanging idle words with the Mouth of Sauron.\n\nChapters\n\n-   I - MINAS TIRITH - Gandalf and Pippin arrive in Minas Tirith; they\n    talk with Denethor; Pippin enters the service of the steward.\n-   II - THE PASSING OF THE GREY COMPANY - Follows Aragorn, Legolas and\n    Gimli as they pass through the Paths of the Dead between Rohan and\n    Gondor.\n-   III - THE MUSTER OF ROHAN - Rohan prepares for war; Merry heads off\n    for Minas Tirith, on a horse with a rider who calls himself\n    Dernhelm.\n-   IV - THE SIEGE OF GONDOR - Back to Gandalf and Pippin, and the\n    preparations of the city of Minas Tirith for the attack by the\n    armies of Mordor; Minas Tirith is besieged; chapter ends with the\n    gate of Minas Tirith broken, and the army of Rohan finally arriving.\n-   V - THE RIDE OF THE ROHIRRIM - The Rohirrim pass through the Druadan\n    Forest with the aid of the wild men who live there, who are led by\n    Ghan-buri-Ghan; the army arrives in Minas Tirith.\n-   VI - THE BATTLE OF THE PELENNOR FIELDS - Armies of Rohan and Gondor\n    fight the armies of Mordor, Rhun and Harad as described in Battle of\n    the Pelennor Fields; Merry and Eowyn together kill the chief of the\n    Nazgûl, the Witch-king of Angmar.\n-   VII - THE PYRE OF DENETHOR - Denethor goes mad and tries to burn\n    Faramir alive (believing him to be dead); he is saved by Gandalf;\n    Denethor then sets fire to himself. They discover that Denethor has\n    been using a Palantir.\n-   VIII - THE HOUSES OF HEALING - Merry, Faramir, Éowyn and many others\n    are injured and placed in the houses of healing; Aragorn uses\n    kingsfoil to help treat the injured.\n-   IX - THE LAST DEBATE - Gimli and Legolas meet Merry and Pippin\n    again; the captains of the west hold a counsel on their next action;\n    they decide to send 7000 men against Mordor to march on the Black\n    Gate.\n-   X - THE BLACK GATE OPENS - The army, with Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli,\n    Legolas and Pippin (but not Merry) marches to the Black Gate. The\n    Mouth of Sauron comes out to discuss terms, and presents tokens,\n    which were owned by Frodo; he then departs and the army of Mordor\n    attacks them.\n\nBook VI: The End of the Third Age/ The Return of the King\n\nIn the meanwhile, the brave and loyal Sam Gamgee (who for a short time\nhad himself become the ring-bearer) enables the long-suffering Frodo\nBaggins to navigate the barren wasteland of Mordor. For part of the way,\nthey are captured by a company of Orcs and must pretend to be orcs\nbefore they are able to escape. The company, tired and half-alive,\nfinally reaches the Crack of Doom, where the One Ring is destroyed along\nwith Gollum, freeing Middle-earth from Sauron's power forever. This\nhappens when Frodo at the last moment decides to keep the ring rather\nthan destroy it, and is attacked by Gollum who bites off Frodo's finger\nto take the ring, trips, and falls into the lava while still holding the\nring. Frodo and Sam are rescued by the giant eagles whom Gandalf rides\nto Mount Doom, from the black gates of Morannon. After Sauron is\ndefeated, his armies at the black gates flee, and the men of Gondor and\nRohan are victorious in the battle.\n\nAragorn is crowned King of Gondor at Minas Tirith.

    "page_id": "6902",
    "text": "FINN AND HENGEST is a study by J.R.R Tolkien, edited by Alan Bliss and\npublished posthumously in book form in\n1982.\n\nIt is not a work of Middle-earth canon.\n\n\nAbout\n\nFinn and Hengest are two Anglo-Saxon heroes appearing in the Old English\nepic poem _Beowulf_ and in the fragment of “The Fight at Finnsburg”.\nHengest has sometimes been identified with the Jutish king of Kent. He\nand his brother Horsa (the names meaning “stallion” and “horse”) were\nthe legendary leaders of the first Anglo-Saxon immigrants to Britain as\nmercenaries in the 5th century).\n\nThe book is based on an edited series of lectures Tolkien made before\nand after World War II. In his lectures, Tolkien argued that the Hengest\nof “The Fight at Finnsburg” and of _Beowulf_ was an historical rather\nthan a legendary figure and that these works record episodes from an\norally composed and transmitted history of the Hengest named in the\n“Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.” This view has gained acceptance from a number\nof medieval historian and Anglo-Saxon scholars both since Tolkien's\ninitial lectures and since the publication of this posthumous\ncollection.\n\nTolkien's lectures describe what he called the “Jutes-on-both-sides\ntheory”, which was his explanation for the puzzling occurrence of the\nword ēotenas in the episode in _Beowulf_. Tolkien read the word as\nJutes, and theorized that the fight was a purely Jutish feud, and Finn\nand Hnæf were simply caught up by circumstance. Tolkien explained both\ntheir presence and their ambiguous loyalty with his following\ninterpretation of the story.\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nHnæf, son of Hoc Half-Dane, is the lord of a Danish people who have\nconquered part of Jutland (probably the northern part of the Cimbrian\npeninsula) and exiled its former Jutish rulers. Finn, king of Frys-Land\n(modern-day Friesland in the Netherlands) has allowed dispossessed Jutes\nto settle in his lands and enter his service. Finn marries Hnæf's older\nsister Hildeburh, and sends their son (whose name was probably\nFriðuwulf) to be fostered in Hnæf's household.\n\nAround the year AD 450, Hnæf sails to Frys-Land in the autumn; his\npurpose is to return Finn's now-grown son and spend the winter in Finn's\ncitadel, celebrating Yule. He brings a retinue of some sixty thanes.\nChief among these thanes is a Jute named Hengest, leader of a band of\nJutes who have taken service under Hnæf. Unfortunately, and foreseen by\nno one, when they arrive at Finn's stronghold they find that many of\nFinn's thanes are also Jutes, particularly one Garulf, who seems to be\nthe rightful heir to the kingdom conquered by Hnæf's people; and these\nFrisian Jutes are at blood feud with Hengest and his band, because\nHengest supports the conquering Danes, if for no other reason. This\nwould explain why Hildeburh “had no cause to praise the fealty of the\nJutes,” since that fealty led to the re-awakening of the feud, which\nkilled her brother, husband, and son.\n\nFinn (who seems guiltless in Tolkien's interpretation) tries to prevent\ntrouble by separating the parties, and allowing Hnæf and his thanes to\noccupy the royal hall, while he removes his own thanes to a different\nbuilding. However, the Frisian Jutes make a pre-dawn attack, hoping to\ntake Hengest and his band by surprise. But the Danes have been expecting\ntrouble, and a watchman sees the light of their approaching torches. He\nasks rhetorically, “What is this light? Is it the dawn in the East, or\nis it the flight of a dragon, or are the gables burning?” Hnæf answers,\n“Neither is this the dawn in the East, nor is it the flight of a dragon,\nnor are the gables of this hall burning,” it is an attack. Prepared, the\nDanes and Hengest's Jutes barricade the two doors of the hall against\nattack. Garulf is warned by one Guðhere not to risk his “precious life”\nin the assault, but he attacks and is the first to fall. Finn's Frisian\nthanes, who have ties of marriage and friendship to Finn's Jutish\nthanes, join in the fight against the Danes. The Danes hold the hall for\nfive days without losing a man. On the morning of the fifth day the\nFrisians force their way into the hall, and in the battle, both Hnæf and\nFriðiwulf are killed. (It is not clear which side Friðiwulf was fighting\non, but Tolkien thinks it likely he was staying in the hall with Hnæf,\nhis foster-father and uncle; this would explain why Beowulf emphasizes\nthat Friðiwulf was laid on the funeral pyre at Hnæf's side.) The\nsurviving Danes and Hengest's Jutes drive the Frisians and Jutes out of\nthe hall and re-barricade the door.\n\nAt this point Finn (who may not have joined in the fight personally)\nintervenes and offers to make a bargain with the survivors. As Tolkien\npoints out, the Danes had several advantages:\n\n1) Finn had lost so many men that he could not force his way into the\nhall again. 2) The Danes were occupying his royal hall, and he was\nunwilling to burn it to get them out. 3) Finn must have felt both guilty\nand ashamed that his feuding thanes had killed Hnæf, who was his\nbrother-in-law and guest. Inside the hall, the survivors are in two\ngroups: Danes, led by a chief thane who is described as Hunlafing (“the\nson of Hunlaf”) and Jutes, led by Hengest. The Jutes are Hengest's own\nband, and owed loyalty to Hnæf only because Hengest followed him. Finn\nat first tries to make peace with the Danes only, but the Danes loyally\ninsist that any peace agreement must include Hengest and his men. Finn\nagrees, and swears an oath of peace: the Danes and Hengest's men will\nlay down their arms, and since they cannot leave Frys-Land until the\nwinter ends, they will sit at Finn's table and technically accept him as\ntheir protector (since he was now their only possible source of food and\nmaintenance, and they had intended to be his guests throughout the\nwinter anyway.) Finn gives the Danes a separate hall to dwell in for the\nwinter, specifying that they shall share it with the sons of the Jutes\n(meaning Hengest and his band.) He also swears that any one of his own\nthanes who tries to renew the feud (by taunting the Danes that they now\nfollow the slayer of their lord) will be punished, possibly with death,\nby Finn himself. The bodies of Hnæf and Friðiwulf are honorably burned.\n\nOver the winter, the Danes and their Jutish allies brood over the fall\nof Hnæf. Hengest is faced with a conflict of duty: whether to honor the\npeace-treaty with Finn, or to honor his duty to avenge his fallen lord.\nFinally the son of Hunlaf takes a sword Hildeleoma (“Battleflame”) which\nwas probably Hnæf's sword, and lays it in Hengest's lap. Hengest “does\nnot refuse the world's counsel” (that is, he goes along with what\neveryone agrees is right) and decides that his loyalty to Hnæf must\noutweigh his obligation to Finn. (In any case, Tolkien points out that\nwe do not see Hengest swearing any oath to Finn; we only see Finn\nswearing oaths to Hengest and the Danes.) When the spring comes, the\nDanes sail home and tell the story of the downfall of Hnæf. They return\nto Finn's stronghold in force. Hengest, having remained in Frys-Land\nunder the guise of upholding the terms of the peace-treaty, opens the\ngates to the invaders and the Danes sack Finn's stronghold, kill Finn\nand all his men, loot and burn the city and return home, taking\nHildeburh with them."

His narrative\nbinds the story and illustrations tightly together, as the text often\ncomments directly on the pictures. Despite not being published during\nTolkien's lifetime, he submitted the book to his publishers as a balm to\nreaders who were hungry for more from Tolkien after the success of _The\nHobbit_. The lavish ink and colored pencil illustrations would have made\nproduction costs prohibitively expensive so Tolkien agreed to redraw the\npictures in a simpler style, although that never came to happen.\n\nThe book was eventually published in 1982, with Tolkien's\ndifficult-to-read handwritten story and illustrations on one page, and a\ntypeset transcription on the facing page."

Tolkien in 1918 which was\npublished in 2007, once more than thirty years-worth of notes written by\nTolkien were compiled and edited by his son, Christopher.\n\nIt is the expanded account of the story of the wanderings and deeds\nof Túrin Turambar, son of Húrin, and his sister Niënor, their struggle\nagainst fate (and the curse cast upon Húrin's kin), as well as the\ntragic end of their lives and that of their mother, Morwen.\n\n\nThe Synopsis\n\nCHRISTOPHER TOLKIEN:\n\n\"There are tales of Middle-earth from times long before _The Lord of the\nRings_, and the story told in this book is set in the great country that\nlay beyond the Grey Havens in the North: lands where Treebeard once\nwalked, but which were drowned in the great cataclysm that ended the\nFirst Age of the World.\n\nIn that remote time Morgoth, the first Dark Lord, dwelt in the vast\nfortress of Angband in the North; and the tragedy of Turin and his\nsister Nienor unfolded within the shadow of the fear of Angband and the\nwar waged by Morgoth against the lands and secret cities of the Elves.\n\nTheir brief and passionate lives were dominated by the elemental hatred\nthat Morgoth bore them as the children of Hurin, the man who had dared\nto defy and to scorn him to his face. Against them he sent his\nformidable servant, Glaurung, a powerful spirit in the form of a huge\nwingless dragon of fire. Into his story of brutal conquest and flight,\nof forest hiding-places and pursuit, of resistance with lessening hope,\nthe mythological persons of the God and the Dragon enter in fearfully\narticulate form. Sardonic and mocking, Glaurung manipulated the fates of\nTúrin and Nienor by lies of diabolic cunning and guile, and the curse of\nMorgoth was fulfilled.\n\nThe earliest versions of this story by J.R.R. Tolkien go back to the end\nof the First World War and the years that followed; but long afterwards,\nwhen _The Lord of the Rings_ was finished, he wrote it anew and greatly\nenlarged it in complexities of motive and character: it became the\ndominant story in his later work on Middle-earth. But he could not bring\nit to final and finished form. In this book I have endeavoured to\nconstruct, after long study of the manuscripts, a coherent narrative\nwithout any editorial invention."

It also contains a chapter concerning\nthe last of the “Great Tales”: _The Tale of Eärendel_.\n\n\nFrom the publisher\n\n\nCanon\n\n_The Fall of Gondolin_ is the third of the Great Tales, but was the\nfirst written by Tolkien, and is the second most complete of the tales\n(after The Children of Húrin, and is less fractured than the materials\nused to make up Beren and Lúthien (2017) as stand alone and 'continuous'\nas possible).\n\nThe sources that cover this major First Age event are the chapters _The\nFall of Gondolin_ of ''The Book of Lost Tales Part Two __ ''and _Of\nTuor and the Fall of Gondolin_ in _The Silmarillion_, which both tell of\nthe founding of the Elven city of Gondolin (built in secret by Turgon\nand his people), of the arrival Tuor, a prince of the Edain, of the\nbetrayal of the city to Morgoth by Turgon's nephew Maeglin, and of its\nsubsequent destruction by Morgoth's armies. There is also a\nunfinished (consisting of around 130 lines) and unpublished poem: _The\nLay of the Fall of Gondolin._ Sections of _Of Maeglin_, and name list\nin _Parma Eldalamberon volume 15_.\n\nThe _Lost Tales_ chapter goes more in depth than the account in _The\nSilmarillion_, telling notably in detail of Tuor's and Ecthelion's feats\nin battle, and mentioning every captain of the Houses of the\nGondolindrim.\n\nBackground\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien actually began writing the story that would become “The\nFall of Gondolin” in 1917, in an army barracks on the back of a sheet of\nmilitary marching music. It is more or less the first traceable story he\never wrote down on paper about the Middle-earth legendarium.\n\nBecause Tolkien was constantly revising his First Age stories, the\nnarrative he wrote in 1917 (published posthumously in _The Book of Lost\nTales Part Two_) remains the only full account of the fall of the city.\nThe narrative in _The Silmarillion_ was the result of the editing by his\nson Christopher of various different sources.\n\nA partial new version of “The Fall of Gondolin” was published in the\n_Unfinished Tales_ under the title “Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin”.\nActually titled “Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin”, this narrative shows\na great expansion of the earlier tale. It can be surmised from this text\nthat Tolkien would have rewritten the entire story, but for reasons that\nare not known he abandoned the text before Tuor actually arrives in the\ncity. For this reason Christopher Tolkien retitled the story before\nincluding it in _Unfinished Tales_.\n"
