In leap years (every fourth year except\ncentennial years) a day was added after Mid-year's Day called\n_Overlithe_. All these days were placed outside of any month. These days\nwere primarily holidays and feast days. _Mid-year's Day_ is meant to\ncorrespond to the summer solstice, which Tolkien describes as being 10\ndays earlier than the middle day of our year. However, since then the\nsummer solstice has shifted slightly so it falls on a different date\nnow, rendering the difference between _Mid-year's Day_ and the middle\nday of our year eleven days, instead of ten.\n\n\nDays of the week\n\nThere were seven days in the Shire week. The first day of the week was\ncalled _Sterday_ and the last day of the week was called _Highday_. The\nMid-year's Day and, when present, Overlithe had no weekday assignments.\nThis arrangement was used because it caused every day to have the same\nweekday designation from year to year (instead of changing as in the\nGregorian calendar).\n\nDay Name\n\nMeaning\n\nRelationship to Gregorian calendar\n\n_Sterday_\n\nStars of Varda\n\nSaturday\n\n_Sunday_\n\nSun\n\nSunday\n\n_Monday_\n\nMoon\n\nMonday\n\n_Trewsday_\n\nTwo Trees of Valinor\n\nTuesday\n\n_Hevensday_\n\nHeavens\n\nWednesday\n\n_Mersday_\n\nSea\n\nThursday\n\n_Highday_\n\nValar\n\nFriday\n\nHighday was a holiday with evening feasts.\n\nIn _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_, the names of months and\ndays are given in modern equivalents.

As for vegetation, Far\nHarad, at least the part closest to Gondor and Umbar consisted of\nscattered woodlands, and further into the south short grasslands until\nit ran into the desert. The deep southern region consisted of vast\ndensely forested areas with some hills.\n\nThe climate was mostly warm and humid with parts of Far Harad and Umbar\nhaving mild winters, hot, dry summers with warm breezes coming from the\nsea. The farther south had a semi-arid to an arid climate as it\nproceeded into the desert regions. The deep southern region’s climate\nwas unknown but was possibly mild compared to the others.\n\n\nInhabitants\n\nThe south is inhabited by the tribes of the Haradrim or Southrons,\nCorsairs of Umbar, and Black Númenóreans. Animal life included monstrous\nOliphaunts or Mumakil, which probably came from the Deep South and were\nexploited for use in warfare and probably hard labor as well. These\nelephants and Haradrim show up in the battle for Minas Tirith, mainly\nagainst Rohan. The population was densest in the region of Umbar and\nsparsest further into the south. The dominant language seemed to Westron\nand many of its people worshiped Sauron and the Darkness.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThese lands existed back in the earliest days of Middle-earth but seemed\nto be much wider and much more connected as part of the greater\ncontinent during the early part of the Years of the Trees. After the\nBattle of the Powers, the Great Sea (Belegaer) was widened and a Great\nGulf was made between the southern part of the Beleriand and the rest of\nthe continent, sundering the two parts from each other. The south could\nonly be reached through two land corridors: a narrow strip that ran\nthrough the land just below the White Mountains were the Nandor passed\nthrough after separating from the main host of the journeying elves, and\na larger corridor of land just below Cuiviénen and Hildórien.\n\nAfter the War of Wrath, the gulf between the northern part of the\ncontinent and the southern part was widened with the loss of the\nBeleriand and part of the land in the south, leaving a coastal area that\nwould once be called Umbar. The inland Sea of Helcar shrunk into the Sea\nof Rhûn and with this the south could now be approached by many ways,\nbarring the forces of evil that would later rule these lands. Throughout\nthe Second and Third ages, the south became populated with tribes of Men\nwho never really became civilized and thus were easily swayed by the\nDark Powers and were a constant threat to the Free Peoples of the West.\n\nAfter the Fall of Númenor in the Second Age, the Black Númenóreans who\nworshiped the Dark Powers settled there and became rulers of Umbar and\nhad a great influence on the Southrons. For a time, the south was ruled\nand influenced by the Dúnedain kingdom of Gondor but that was soon lost.\nPirates known as the Corsairs ruled Umbar up onto the War of the Ring.\nThe south from then on was populated by the enemies of the Free Peoples\nuntil pacified by King Aragorn II Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom after\nthe War of the Ring."

For the land\nacross the ocean to the west see the Undying Lands._\n\nThe WEST refers to the large region Middle-earth and includes the lands\nof Beleriand (up to the end of the First Age) Lindon, Eriador, Gondor,\nRhovanion, and others, essentially all the lands west of Rhûn and\nMordor. It is also used to describe the Free Peoples of Middle-earth\nlike the Elves, Men, Dwarves, Hobbits and Ents particularly during the\nThird Age. West is normally 'the good' versus the bad from the East.\n(i.e. Sauron, Harad and Easterlings)\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe Beleriand consisted of mostly plains and lowlands with scattered\nwoodlands, dense forests, and grasslands. The lands of Hithlum, Mithrim,\nand Dor-lómin were plateaus consisting of short grasslands and scattered\nwoodlands surrounded by mountains. Dorthonion was mostly a plateau\nsurrounded by a mountain range in its south and consisted of moorlands\nand dense forests in its north. There were some hill lands such as the\nones near the Blue Mountains and Himring.\n\nThe Beleriand’s climate varied in degrees. The West Beleriand consisted\nof cold winter, cool to mild summers in the northern part with cold, dry\nprevailing winds from the north, and warm, moist prevailing winds from\nthe sea. The southern part consisted of mild winters, mild summers with\nwarm, moist prevailing winds coming primarily from the sea. The East\nBeleriand consisted of severe, dry winters, short, cool summers with\nstrong prevailing winds coming form the northern part near Morgoth’s\ndomain. The southern part had mild winters, mild summers with warm,\nmoist prevailing winds from the sea with the exception of the realms of\nMaedhros and Maglor between Dorthonion and the Blue Mountains, which had\ncold winters and mild summers due to their proximity to the north.\n\nAfter the fall of the Beleriand, the West’s terrain from Lindon to\nRhovanion and Gondor was mostly lowlands and plains consisting of mostly\nshrubs, shrubs thickets and scattered woodlands. Grasslands prevailed in\nRohan, formerly Calenardhon and dense forests were in areas such as\nFangorn and Mirkwood. Hill lands were mostly in mid-Eriador, next to\nMisty Mountains, the Wold in Rohan, and the lands east of the Grey\nMountains.\n\nThe climate variation was mostly the same as it was during the First Age\nwith severe winters and cool summers in the lands near the cold north,\nwith cold prevailing winds. Cold but milder weather conditions dominated\nnorthern Eriador and northern Rhovanion, and south from that mild\nconditions with a tendency toward fog existed throughout most of the\nrest of Eriador and the lands to the south, with warm, moist prevailing\nwinds coming from the sea. Southern Rhovanion was overall a bit colder\nthen the north possibly due to its shielding from the warmer prevailing\nwinds from the sea, from the Misty Mountains. Both Rohan and Gondor were\nwarmer climates due to their proximity to the south and the influence of\nthe warm prevailing winds from the sea.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the Years of the Trees and the First Age during the days of the\nBeleriand, the West consisted of mostly good races which were Moriquendi\nelves, Noldorin exiles, and later Edain men with some faithful\nEasterlings, and Dwarves living in the mountains. The enemy was in the\nNorth. With the destruction of the Beleriend, the West became the lands\nof Lindon, Eriador, Gondor, Rhovanion, and others with the East being\nthe lands of Rhûn and Mordor. In the Second Age, the West's population\nwas mostly primitive men and a few elves located mostly in Lindon,\nEregion, and some in Greenwood the Great. There were some tribes of Orcs\nliving in the Misty Mountains with some in the Grey Mountains. The\nenemies, Sauron and Easterlings mostly came from Mordor and Rhûn in the\nEast until their defeat during the War of the Last Alliance.\n\nIn the Third Age, the West was mostly nations of Men living in the\nRealms in Exile (Arnor and Gondor). Other races such as Dwarves and\nElves decreased in numbers becoming hidden peoples living in realms such\nas: Moria, the Lonely Mountain, Lothlórien, and Mirkwood. Hobbits, once\na minor race living in the Gladden Fields migrated to Bree and then The\nShire, the most populated of their realms. Ents diminished in numbers\nremained solely in Fangorn forest. The enemies from then on were\ntraditionally located in the East, though for some time many of the\nthreats came from within the West in places such as Angmar, Misty\nMountains, and Dol Guldur but during the latter half of the age the\nenemies were solely from the East.\n\nThe dominant language in the West during the First Age was Elvish and\nearly Mannish and later Westron prevailed with others being used only\nregionally."

After the destruction of Beleriand, the shape of the region changed\nconsiderably becoming more of dried land consisting of scattered\nwoodlands and lowlands. The Sea of Helcar disappeared, possibly\nshrinking into the smaller Sea of Rhûn, Cuiviénen merged with the land\nand was no longer along the coast, Hildórien still bordered the East Sea\nto its east; however, both of these realms were probably no longer\ninhabited as they once were. The Orocarni Mountains still remained\nintact and unbroken.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Elves and Dwarves (in the mountains) were the first to inhabit the\nEast and still continued to do so even after many Elves left on the\nGreat Journey to Valinor. Later during the First Age, Men inhabited the\nland and quickly spread into the west but only the tribes of the Edain\nmoved into the Beleriand escaping the Dark Powers, while the earlier\nEasterling tribes stayed and continued to serve them.\n\nThroughout the Second and Third ages, the region still continued to be\ninhabited by the Easterlings who completely dominated the area and still\nserved the Dark Powers. The Easterlings also sometimes refer to their\nland as the Land of the Rising Sun. Dwarves probably still lived in the\nOrocarni mountain range as well as other men and creatures. The Blue\nWizards - Pallando and Alatar were said to have gone out there in\nwagons, but never returned.

A father-name may\nactually be the same as the father's, with a suffix added, such is the\ncase with Gildor Inglorion. A _mother-name_ is given later at birth and\nhad great significance, as Elven mothers are said to hold great insight\ninto the character of their children. It is also believed that mothers\nhave the gift of prophecy in matters concerning their children.\n\nThe _epessë_ or the “after-name” is the third type. The after-name is\ngiven later in life, but not necessarily by their kin, as a title of\nadmiration. In some circumstances, the _epessë_ is chosen by the Elf\nhimself or herself. An Elf could be referred to by any of the three, but\nthe _epessë_ typically took preference.\n\nIn songs and history, the _epessë_ is usually used rather than the\n_essi_.\n\n\nExamples\n\n-   MAEDHROS, the oldest son of Fëanor, was by his brothers referred to\n    as _RUSSANDOL_ (copper-top): an _epessë_ he had earned because of\n    his ruddy hair. _Maedhros_ itself was an _epessë_: his father-name\n    had been _Nelyafinwë_ (Finwë the third: Fëanor's own father name had\n    been (Curu)finwë), and his mother-name _Maitimo_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   _GIL-GALAD_ (Star of Radiance) is the mother-name of _Rodnor_, son\n    of Orodreth. He is given the epessë _Ereinion_ because of his\n    heritage: the name literally means “Scion of Kings”.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   _CÍRDAN_ is the _epessë_ of a Telerin Elf who remained in Beleriand,\n    and later Lindon, until the end of the Third Age. His original name\n    had been forgotten, and he was referred to always as Círdan, a title\n    that had been given to him as Lord of the Falas before the First\n    Age.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   FINROD FELAGUND is usually referred to as _Felagund_ (hewer of\n    caves), an original derogatory nickname given to him because of his\n    dwellings at Nargothrond. Finrod adopted the name, and made it a\n    title of honour.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   _GALADRIEL_ is the Sindarin translation of Alatáriel, the latter\n    being the Telerin _epessë_ originally given to her by Celeborn.\n    _Galadriel_ means “Maiden Crowned by a Radiant Garland”. The name\n    itself is an _epessë_: her father-name is Artanis (_noble woman_)\n    and her mother-name is Nerwen (_man-maiden_).\n\nde:Epesse pl:Epessë sk:Epessë"

The bodies of the dead decayed as normal, but over time part of the\nfield became a wetland, the Dead Marshes, where the images of the fallen\ncould be seen.

The\nbattle took place on the great, treeless, open plain between the Dead\nMarshes and Cirith Gorgor.\n\nThe Battle of the Black Gate, was the last major battle against Sauron\nin the War of the Ring, fought at the Black Gate of Mordor. The army of\nthe West, 6,000 strong by now, led by Aragorn marched on the gate as a\ndiversionary feint to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo and Sam,\nwho were carrying the One Ring through Mordor. It was hoped that Sauron\nwould think Aragorn had the Ring and was now trying to use it to\noverthrow Mordor.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word _Dagorlad_ means 'battle plain' in the Sindarin language."

About it lay a smooth sward, shelving\ndown on all sides to its bare umbroken rim.”\n\n\nGeography\n\n\n\nThe lake lay less than a mile east and a little below the Great Gates of\nMoria. It was long and oval, shaped like a great spear-head thrust deep\ninto the northern glen of the vale. Its waters were dark: a deep blue\nlike clear evening sky and there was a smooth sward of grass around its\nrim.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the First Age, Durin the oldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves\nwandered into Azanulbizar vale and beheld in a small, still lake a\nreflection of himself bearing a crown of seven stars. The stars were the\nconstellation Durin's Crown which the elves call Valacirca and men call\nthe Big Bear. Because of this sign Durin chose to build his great hall\nMoria in the mountains above that vale. The name Kheled-zâram is in\nKhuzdul and means “Glass-lake”. In Westron it was called MIRRORMERE, it\nis probably so named because the waters of the lake were always smooth\nand the stars could always be seen reflected in its surface no matter\nthe time of day. Only Durin, however, could see his own reflection.\n\nThe Dwarves of Durin's Folk regarded this site as sacred and built a\nmonument there. It was a single stone column called Durin's Stone,\nstanding by the roadside. After Moria was abandoned it fell into\ndisrepair, and in the last years of the Third Age it was cracked,\nweather-worn, and broken at the top.\n\nWhen Balin came to retake Moria in TA 2989 one of his companions, a\ndwarf named Flói was slain in a battle before the Gates and was buried\nin a place of honour by the banks of Kheled-zâram. Balin himself was\nkilled here five years later, by an orc arrow, when he went alone to\nlook into the lake.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring stopped briefly at Kheled-zâram while Gimli,\nFrodo, and Sam took time to look into the lake, even though they were in\ngreat hurry."

Forests corrupted by the dark forces like\nMirkwood were even more dangerous and perilous, and contained many\nsavage and unnatural creatures.\n\n\nSignificance to the Children of Ilúvatar\n\nElves seemed to be the only ones fond of forests, particularly the\nAvarian and Nandorian elves that settled in them and stayed in their\nbounds. Men and Dwarves seemed to prefer living in walled cities and\ntowns or underground, and generally cut down trees for their\nmetallurgical work, usually in moderation. A few exceptions include the\nearly Fallohides living in the forested areas near the Misty Mountains\nand the Drúedain living in the forest of the same name. Orcs and other\nevil creatures generally hated forests and usually hewed them down\nwithout pity nor respect to fuel their warmongering.\n\nPeoples living in forested realms include:\n\n-   The early Elves of Cuiviénen\n-   The Sindar of Doriath\n-   Eöl of Nan Elmoth\n-   The Laiquendi of the Ossiriand\n-   Elves of Greenwood the Great under Oropher and then Mirkwood under\n    his son Thranduil\n-   Woodmen near Mirkwood\n-   Elves of Lothlórien and East Lothlórien\n\n\nHistory\n\nAncient and First Age\n\nForests and woods as with all growing things originated with Yavanna who\nplanted their first seeds and were under her direct care, until the evil\nof Melkor ruined and destroyed much of them long before the Awakening of\nthe Elves. During the Years of the Trees when the Valar removed to Aman,\nthe first real and dense forests arose and spread throughout\nMiddle-earth in parts of the Beleriand, in Eriador where a vast forest\nreigned for many thousands of years, and some in the land of Rhovanion\nwhere Greenwood stood. The vast lands of the south of Middle-earth and\nmuch of the Dark Land where very few people lived also had many dense\nforested areas. All forests in the Beleriand perished with its\ndestruction at the end of the First Age.\n\nSecond Age\n\nThe vast primordial forests in Eriador stood until the middle of this\nage when the Númenóreans began cutting them down to built their fleets\nand fuel their desire for empire and dominion. Then when Sauron declared\nwar in SA 1693 much of the forested area in Eriador was burned to the\nground or extensively damaged.\n\nThird Age\n\nBy the Third Age all that remained of the vast forests of Eriador were\nFangorn forest and the Old Forest both of which were guarded by the Ents\nand Tom Bombadil. When Sauron reestablished himself in TA 1050 and moved\nto Dol Guldur, Greenwood became evil and perilous and was unsafe to\nenter save in secret.\n\nFourth Age and Beyond\n\nWith the defeat of Sauron in the War of the Ring and the clearing of Dol\nGuldur, Mirkwood was freed from evil and Men and Elves worked to restore\nit to its former beauty. Perhaps the many forested areas survived the\ndominion of men in the later ages but it is not known.\n\n\nOther Forests in Middle-earth\n\n-   Forest of Brethil\n-   Dorthonion\n-   Neldoreth\n-   Chetwood\n-   Bindbole wood\n-   Lothlórien"

    "page_id": "3784",
    "text": "_ON FAIRY-STORIES_ is an essay written by J. R. R. Tolkien that was\npublished as a book.\n\nTolkien originally wrote the essay in 1939 for his lecture on the\nsubject of Fairly Tales in general to an audience at University of St.\nAndrews in Scotland. Afterwards, it was first published within _Essays\nPresented to Charles Williams_ in 1947. It was then subsequently\npublished with _Leaf by Niggle_ in _Tree and Leaf_ as well as in _The\nTolkien Reader_, around 1966. It has since been renewed as an Expanded\nedition (pictured right), edited by Tolkien scholars Verlyn Flieger and\nDouglas Anderson, in 2008.\n\nThe essay contains Tolkien's explanation of his philosophy on fantasy\nand on “faerie”, and thoughts on the crafting of the mythos.\n\n\nSummary\n\nTolkien named the genre _Fairy Stories,_ which he carefully\ndistinguishes from actual “Fairy Tales”. This distinction seems to be\ntwofold. First, he defines _fairy stories_ as not stories about fairies\nor other supernatural beings, but stories about the interaction between\nhumans and those beings. Second, he emphasizes that through the use of\nfantasy, which he equates with fancy and imagination, the author can\nbring the reader to experience a world which is consistent and rational,\nyet utterly strange as well. He calls this “a rare achievement of Art”,\nand notes that it was important to him as a reader: “It was in\nfairy-stories that I first divined the potency of the words, and the\nwonder of things, such as stone, and wood, and iron; tree and grass;\nhouse and fire; bread and wine.”\n\nHaving defined the genre, Tolkien goes on to defend its utility on three\ngrounds. First, suggesting that fairy stories allow the reader to review\nhis or her own world from the “perspective” of a different world. This\nconcept, which shares much in common with cultural relativism, Tolkien\ncalls “recovery”, in the sense that one's unquestioned assumptions might\nbe recovered and changed by an outside perspective. Second, he defends\nfairy stories as offering escapist pleasure to the reader. And third,\nTolkien suggests that fairy stories (can) provide moral or emotional\nconsolation, through their happy ending, which he terms a\n“eucatastrophe”."

Tolkien.\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe book grew out of an attempt to explain the meaning of “Faery” by\nmeans of a brief story about a cook and his cake. This would have been\npart of a preface to George MacDonald's famous faerie story _The Golden\nKey_. But the story grew from there and became a tale in its own right.\n\nThe most recent edition includes a previously unpublished essay by\nTolkien, explaining the background and just why the elf-king spent so\nlong in Wooton Major. It also explains how the story grew from this\nfirst idea into the published version.\n\nThe book was originally called “THE GREAT CAKE”, but the title was\nchanged to “SMITH OF WOOTTON MAJOR” in an attempt to suggest an early\nwork by P.G. Wodehouse.\n\nIt is not definitely connected to the Middle-earth legendarium. Both\n_Faery_ and Valinor are lands outside of the normal world, but Valinor\ncannot normally be visited by mortals. There are lesser Elven kingdoms\nthat humans can visit and return: Faramir mentions visitors to Lorien.\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe village of Wootton Major is well-known around the countryside for\nits annual festivals, which are particularly famous for their culinary\ndelights. The biggest festival of them all is the Feast of Good\nChildren. This festival is celebrated only once every twenty-four years,\nand the celebrations take the form of a party to which twenty-four\nchildren of the village are invited. The highpoint of the party is the\nGreat Cake, which is remarkable for its hidden magical ingredients.\nWhoever swallows one of these is given the rare gift of an entry into\nthe Land of Faery.\n\nThis year the magic star hidden inside the Great Cake was eaten by a\nblacksmith’s son. The boy did not feel any of its magical properties at\nonce but on the morning of his tenth birthday the star fixed itself on\nhis forehead and marked him as one intimate with the Faeryfolk. This boy\ngrew up to be a blacksmith like his father, but in his free time he\nroamed into the Land of Faery. The star on his forehead protected him\nfrom the evils threatening mortals in that land, and the Folk called him\nStarbrow and told him about their land and its hidden beauties and\ndangers.\n\nThe years passed and it was now time for another Feast of Good Children.\nSmith had had his precious gift for most of his life now and the time\nhad come for it to be passed on to some other child. So he gave up the\nstar, and the mysterious new Master Cook baked it into the festive cake\nonce more.",

There were several\ndifferent types of axes, including single-bladed and double-bladed axes\nas well as throwing axes. Many Dwarves carried more than one Axe.

    "text": "FARMER GILES OF HAM (written in 1947, published in 1949) is a short\nMiddle Earth story written by J. R. R. Tolkien. The story describes a\nseries of encounters between Farmer Giles and a wily Dragons named\nChrysophylax. It is set in a fantasy Britain of long ago, which has\nmythical creatures, medieval knights, and primitive firearms. It is\nhappily anachronistic, and is more like a folk-tale than the sweeping\nepics which Tolkien is better known for. The book was originally\nillustrated by Pauline Baynes.\n\n\nPlot\n\nFarmer Giles was not a hero. He was fat and red-bearded and enjoyed a\nslow, comfortable life. One day a rather deaf and short-sighted giant\nblundered on to his land. Farmer Giles managed to scare him away with a\nblunderbluss shot in its general direction. The people of the village\ncheered: Farmer Giles was a hero. His reputation spread far and wide\nacross the kingdom. Giles was rewarded by the King of the Middle\nKingdom, with a sword named Caudimordax or “Tailbiter”, a powerful\nweapon against dragons.\n\nThe giant reports to its monstrous friends that there are no more\nknights, just stinging flies (actually scrap metal from Giles'\nblunderbuss), in the Middle Kingdom. This prompts a dragon, Chrysophylax\nDives, to investigate the area and everyone turns to the accidental hero\nFarmer Giles to deal with it.\n\nThe story makes light of the great dragon-slaying traditions. The\nknights who are supposed to do the job are useless fops more intent on\n“precedence and etiquette” than on noticing huge dragon footprints\nlittering the landscape. “Giles” is also an interesting commentary on\nhow people react to danger.

Due the nature of the peoples, underground living was\npreferable save for the Mannish peoples that didn’t live in the\nmountains or the hills. Languages spoken were Orcish dialects, Khuzdul,\nand Mannish languages especially Westron in later days.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThese lands existed back in the earliest days of Middle-earth but what\nwas later the Grey Mountains was in these days part of the long\noppressive Iron Mountains that dominated the north. In these days, there\nwere no known dwarf or orc colonies in the hills or in the mountains and\ndragons were not known to have lived in this area at this time, but\ntribes of Silvan elves and later Mannish tribes were known to be living\nin or near the Northeast.\n\nAfter the War of Wrath when the Beleriand fell beneath the waves, the\norcs and the remaining dragons fled into up into the mountains and hide\nand created hidden realms, and became an ever increasing threat.\nStarting at around TA 1980 when the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm were driven\nout of by the Balrog, dwarves began moving into the Grey Mountains and\nlater into the Lonely Mountain and then into the Iron Hills. Men also\nbegan establishing themselves in Dale and Laketown and good relations\nbetween the dwarves and men prospered for many years. However, when the\ndragon Smaug heard of the happy prosperity of the two peoples and their\ntreasures, he descended down upon the two realms and destroyed them. The\ndwarves were then forced to flee from the Lonely Mountain and the men\nmoved south into Laketown.\n\nAfter the Battle of Five Armies during the Quest of Erebor, the dwarves\nand the men regained both the Lonely Mountain and Dale and the\nNorth-east prospered for many years. The Northeast still thrived into\nFourth Age despite attacks by the Easterlings, culminating in the Battle\nof Dale."

This was divided into 8766 six-day\n“weeks”, or _enquier_. They also recognised the solar year, which was\ncalled a _coranar_ (“sun-round”) or _loa_ (“growth”). In Rivendell, the\n_loa_ began on the spring equinox and was divided into six “months” or\nseasons, as follows.\n\n  QUENYA NAME   SINDARIN NAME   ENGLISH TRANSLATION   DURATION\n  ------------- --------------- --------------------- ----------\n  _tuilë_       _ethuil_        Spring                54 days\n  _lairë_       _laer_          Summer                72 days\n  _yávië_       _iavas_         Autumn                54 days\n  _quellë_      _firith_        Fading                54 days\n  _hrívë_       _rhîw_          Winter                72 days\n  _coirë_       _echuir_        Stirring              54 days\n\nFive other days, two between _coirë_ and _tuilë_ (called _Yestare_ and\n_Mettare_) and three between _yávië_ and _hrívë_ (called the _enderi_),\nmeant the calendar added up to 365 days. Irregularities were allowed for\nby adding another three days every twelve years, except the last year of\na _yén_.\n\nThe year (_loa_) begins on March 21st. That day is called _Yestare_. The\nnext day begins the season of _tuile_. _Tuil'e_ ends on May 14th.\n_Laire _begins on May 15th and ends on July 25th. _Yavie_ begins on July\n26th and ends on September 17th. The next three days are the _enderi_\n(September 18th, 19th, and 20th). _Quelle_begins on September 21st and\nends on November 13th. Then'' Hrive ''starts on the 14th. It ends on\nJanuary 24th. _Coire _begins on January 25th and ends on March 19th. The\nnext day is ''Mettare. '' These dates only work until the enderi have\nbeen doubled. Once every twelve years the elves would double the\n''enderi ''to replace having a leap year.\n\n\nNúmenórean Calendar\n\nThe calendar adopted by the Men of Middle-earth was called the King's\nReckoning, and was very similar to our own. It had a week of seven days,\nand divided the 365-day year of the Elves into twelve months (_astar_),\nten with 30 days and two with 31. Also like our calendar, the Númenórean\nyear began in midwinter. They retained the two days between the end of\none year and the start of the next (_mettarë_ and _yestarë_), but\nreduced the mid-year days to one (_loëndë_, essentially adding the other\ntwo to the mid-year “long months”). Leap years had two mid-year days. In\nthe Second and Third Ages, years were reckoned from the beginning of the\nAge.\n\nVarious irregularities occurred in this calendar, especially following\nthe Downfall. In TA 2060, Mardil Voronwë revised the calendar, and the\nnew version became the Steward's Reckoning. The months of Steward's\nReckoning all had 30 days, and there were two additional “extra” days at\nthe equinoxes, _tuilérë_ and _yáviérë_. The five extra days (the\nequinoxes, midsummer and two at midwinter) were holidays.\n\nIn TA 3021, the Reunited Kingdom adopted a New Reckoning, which began\nthe year on the spring equinox, as in the Elven calendar.\n\nThe months of the Reckonings were in Quenya (or Sindarin among the\nDúnedain) and were:\n\n  QUENYA NAME   SINDARIN NAME\n  ------------- ---------------\n  Narvinyë      Narwain\n  Nénimë        Nínui\n  Súlìmë        Gwaeron\n  Víressë       Gwirith\n  Lótessë       Lothron\n  Náríë         Nórui\n  Cermië        Cerveth\n  Urimë         Urui\n  Yavannië      Ivanneth\n  Narquelië     Narbeleth\n  Hísimë        Hithui\n  Ringarë       Girithron\n\n\nHobbit Calendar\n\n(More detail can be found under Shire Calendar)\n\nThe Hobbits, who had adopted the King's Reckoning, altered it in a\ndifferent way from the Steward's Reckoning. Like the Steward's\nReckoning, they had twelve months of thirty days, and five holidays\noutside the months. However, they had three “extra” days in midsummer\nand two in midwinter, similar to the Elven calendar. In the Shire the\nthree days of midsummer were called Lithedays, and the two days of\nmidwinter were the Yuledays. In leap years, the extra day was added to\nthe Lithedays and called Overlithe. The other innovation in the Shire\ncalendar was to make Midsummer's Day (and the Overlithe) outside the\nweek, as well as the month, meaning the days of the week would not\nchange in relation to the days of the year. The Shire Reckoning is the\ncalendar used in the _Red Book of Westmarch_, and hence in _The Lord of\nthe Rings_. It counts from the founding of the Shire in TA 1600.\n\nThe Hobbit names of the months came from names used in Anduin in\nantiquity, and their meanings were often obscure or forgotten. They\nwere:\n\n  SHIRE NAME      BREE NAME\n  --------------- ------------------------\n  2 Yule          2 Yule\n  Afteryule       Frery\n  Solmath         Solmath\n  Rethe           Rethe\n  Astron          Chithing\n  Thrimidge       Thrimidge\n  Forelithe       Lithe\n  1 Lithe         First Summerday\n  Midyear's Day   Second Summerday\n  Overlithe       Third Summerday\n  2 Lithe         Third/Fourth Summerday\n  Afterlithe      Mede\n  Wedmath         Wedmath\n  Halimath        Harvestmath\n  Winterfilth     Wintring\n  Blotmath        Blooting\n  Foreyule        Yulemath\n  1 Yule          1 Yule\n\n(Given the decidedly Old English sound of these names, it can be assumed\nthat this is J.R.R.

A\ntransliteration appears in Book II, Chapter 2, “The Council of Elrond”,\nwhere the inscription is read by Gandalf (listen to the inscription):\n\n  _Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh\n  burzum-ishi krimpatul._\n\n\n\nThese words, in the Black Speech of Mordor, are physically painful to\nall the free people of middle earth, except hobbits, who are especially\nresistant to evil. At the Council of Elrond, most probably because of\nthe power and the shadow they bring (the Shadow being the more harmful\nto the elves), Elrond is seen looking very annoyed when the inscription\nis read. The inscription uses the Fëanorian Characters (Tengwar) because\nall forms of writing Tolkien describes at that time were invented by the\nElves.\n\nRoughly translated, they mean:\n\n  _One Ring to rule them all, One ring to find them; One ring to bring\n  them all_\n\n  _and in the darkness bind them._\n\nNOTE: some recent editions of _The Fellowship of the Ring _accidentally\nomit the first two clauses of this phrase from Chapter 2.  The entire poem reads:\n\nGandalf first learned of the Ring-inscription when he read the account\nthat Isildur had written before marching north to his death and the loss\nof the Ring. When Isildur had cut the ring from Sauron's hand, it was\nburning hot, and so Isildur was able to transcribe the inscription\nbefore it faded.\n\nWhen Gandalf subsequently heated the ring that Bilbo had found and\npassed on to Frodo, the inscription appeared, leaving him in no doubt\nthat it was the One Ring.\n"

    "title": "Return of the Ñoldor",
    "page_id": "4266",
    "text": "The Valar and Eldar now fully understood the extent of Melkor's\ntreachery. Fëanor, upon learning of his father's murder and the theft of\nhis prized Silmarils, named Melkor “Morgoth”, or “Black Foe of the\nWorld” (literally “Black Enemy”). Now King of the Ñoldor, Fëanor\ndelivered the most impassioned speech ever given in Arda, which he\nunwittingly filled with Morgoth's taint. He railed against the Great\nEnemy, but because of Morgoth's influence, he also blamed the Valar for\nMorgoth's deeds. He persuaded most his people that because the Valar had\nabandoned them, the Ñoldor must follow him to Middle-earth and fight\nMorgoth. Fëanor then swore the terrible Oath of Fëanor which all seven\nof his sons also proclaimed, vowing to fight anyone and everyone —\nwhether Elf, Man, Maia, or Valar — who withheld the Silmarils, and\ninvoking even Ilúvatar as a witness. This became known as the Oath of\nFëanor and later the cause for great tragedy among his seven sons.\n\nSeeking a way to get to Middle-earth, he went to the shores of Aman,\nwhere the seafaring Teleri lived, and demanded the use of their ships.\nThe Teleri refused, and in response, Fëanor and his armed and\nimpassioned Ñoldor attacked the lightly-armed Teleri, destroyed their\nsettlements and seized the ships. This act is known as the First\nKinslaying.\n\nIn repentance of this act, Finarfin, Finwë's third son, took his host\nand turned back. They were accepted by the Valar, and Finarfin ruled as\nHigh-King of the Noldor in Valinor.\n\nThere were not enough ships to carry all of the Ñoldor across the sea,\nso Fëanor and his sons led the first group. Upon arriving at Losgar, in\nthe land of Lamoth, in the far west of Beleriand, where and\nUngoliant had passed not long before, they decided to burn the ships and\nleave the followers of Fingolfin behind. However, Fëanor accidentally\nleft his son Amras in the ships, and he was burned alive. The earth\nbeing flat in those days, the remaining Ñoldor saw the flames, and\nperceived that if they were to go to Middle-earth[[, they had no choice\nbut to cross the [[Helcaraxë. This they did under the leadership of\nFingolfin, and suffered great losses along the way, which greatly added\nto the animosity they had for Fëanor and his sons.\n\nLearning of the Ñoldor's arrival, Morgoth summoned his armies from his\nfortress of Angband and attacked Fëanor's encampment in Mithrim. This\nbattle was called the Battle under the Stars, or _Dagor-nuin-Giliath_,\nfor the Sun and Moon had not yet been made. The Ñoldor managed to win\nthe battle, and disperse Morgoth's armies. Fëanor, still in a great\nrage, pressed on toward Angband with his sons. He came even within sight\nof Angband, but was ambushed by a force of Balrogs, with few elves about\nhim. He fought mightily, hewing even after receiving several wounds from\nGothmog, captain of the Balrogs. His sons came upon the Balrogs with\ngreat force of elves, and were able to drive them off. However, as\nFëanor was being escorted off the battlefield, he knew his wounds were\nmortal. He cursed Angband thrice, but with the eyes of death, he knew\nthat his elves, unaided, would never throw down the dark towers. At the\nmoment of his death the passing of his fiery spirit reduced his body to\nashes.\n\nHis sons were still bound by the Oath to recover the Silmarils, which\nwould determine the events of Middle-earth during the First Age."

This power was with Ilúvatar at the very\nbeginning, so when Melkor sought for it alone, it was in vain, for he\ncould never find it because it was solely with Eru himself. Later, Eru\nset it (or an aspect of it) at the Heart of Arda.\n\nThe Secret Fire was also described as being part of all Fëa, the soul of\na living being or the spirit: it was that Gift which makes sentient\nbeings capable of independent thought and will.\n\nIn _The Fellowship of the Ring_, Gandalf the Grey referred to both the\nSecret Fire and the Flame of Anor at the Bridge of Khazad-dum when\nconfronting the Balrog:\n\n_Anor_ was a name for the Sun in the mythology, as well as a name for\nthe _True West_ (i.e. Valinor). Further, some have speculated that\nGandalf said “flame of Anor” in reference to the fact that he wielded\none of the Three Rings of Power, Narya. Thus it is uncertain if the\n_flame of Anor_ was identical to the _Secret Fire_, but both it and _The\nSecret Fire_ identified Gandalf as a servant of the Valar."

In the world of Arda, named towers were prominent, symbolic, and\nsometimes held great character.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the Two Trees\n\nWhilst dwelling on the island of Almaren, the two most prominent towers\nin all of Arda were Helcar and Ringol which held the great lamps of\nIlluin and Ormal that lit the world in its youth. They both were thrown\ndown and destroyed by Melkor, causing a great change to the world.\n\nBefore the Sun and Moon\n\nSuccessfully reaching Aman, the Elves built Tirion where stood the\nMindon Eldaliéva, which dominated the city and symbolized elven glory in\nthe far West.\n\nFirst Age\n\nWhen the Noldor returned to Middle-earth in pursuit of Morgoth, many\ntowers were built for the observation of the enemy in the North. The\ntallest and most prominent being Minas Tirth built by Finrod to watch\nthe northern plain of Ard-galen, until it was conquered by Sauron.\n\nSecond Age\n\nEarly\n\nAs the Beleriand and its great civilizations were destroyed at the end\nof the First Age, the only great towers in Arda were located in Eldamar\nand Númenor. The elves of Tol Eressëa built a great tower in the eastern\npart of the island used for observing the sea. Men of Numenor yearning\nfor the west could see its lights from both the haven of Andúnië and\nfrom the decks of their great ships.\n\nLater\n\nAfter Numenor's destruction and the removal of Aman from the circles of\nthe world, the surviving Dúnedain of the Realms in Exile built towers of\ntheir own most of which held a Palantír, which they used to order their\nkingdoms and to communicate with each other during times of strife. In\nthe northwest lied the white towers of Arnor. Elostirion, built by\nGil-galad in honor of Elendil was its tallest and most prominent.\nNortheast of it was the tower of Annúminas in the capital, and further\nto the southeast was the tower of Amon Sûl on Weathertop.\n\nIn far southeast of Amon Sûl was the tower Orthanc in Isengard or\nAngrenost which in those days belonged exclusively to Gondor. Then,\nthere were the great towers of Gondor proper in Minas Anor, Osgiliath,\nand Minas Ithil all of which held one of the seeing stones in those\ndays.\n\nThird Age\n\nDuring the turbulent times that came with the Third Age, many of the\ngreat towers of the Dúnedain were destroyed, abandoned or occupied by\nthe enemy. Of the most infamous were Orthanc, the Tower of Cirith Ungol,\nand the Towers of the Teeth some of which were originally built by the\nDúnedain after the war of the Last Alliance to keep watch on Mordor, but\nwere abandoned and left behind due to the waning of the kingdoms of men\nand the Great Plague. Orthanc was occupied by Saruman and soon became a\nplace of evil rivaling Sauron. Only the Tower of Ecthelion remained good\nand was seen as a symbol of hope.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring and the restoration of the great kingdoms of\nmen and that of peace, the great towers of the enemy fell and were\ndestroyed. Orthanc still stood and was for a time ruled by Treebeard\nuntil he gave it up. Barad-dûr, the ultimate stronghold of the Dark Lord\nSauron, had been the highest tower in all Middle-earth during this age.\n\nFourth Age and Beyond\n\nOrthanc remained into King Elessar's time, and was found to contain many\nof his ancestor's heirlooms and treasures hoarded up and hidden by\nSaruman. It is unknown whether new towers were erected by the men of the\nReunited Kingdom.\n\n\nNote\n\n“The Two Towers” could refer to any two of the following towers:\n\n-   Orthanc\n-   Minas Tirith\n-   Minas Morgul\n-   Barad-dûr"

    "title": "Oath of Fëanor",
    "page_id": "4267",
    "text": "The OATH OF FËANOR was an oath taken by Fëanor and his seven sons to\nnon-negotiable enmity against any person who would take a Silmaril or\nkeep it from them. After Morgoth killed Finwe and stole the Silmarilli,\nthis oath became the cause of some of the most terrible and tragic\ncrimes in the history of Arda.\n\n\nHistory\n\nLearning of his father's death at the hands of Morgoth, Fëanor went back\nto Tirion, breaking the exile set by the Valar. At Tirion, Fëanor gave\nan impassioned speech in which he convinced the vast majority of the\nÑoldor to follow him to Middle-earth to wrest the Silmarils back from\nMorgoth and avenge Finwë. At the end of his speech, furious and ever\nprideful, Fëanor swore the dreadful oath to Eru, calling Manwë and Varda\nin witness. This oath saw him pledge, on pain of calling upon himself\nthe Everlasting Darkness, to pursue with violence any who would keep or\nhold a Silmaril from him, no matter who it was, and no matter what the\nreason or circumstance. His seven sons leaped to his side and swore the\noath with him. \n\nFëanor died soon after his return to Middle-Earth but the remaining\noath-takers, his sons, lived on in relative harmony with the Eldar of\nBeleriand, in no small part thanks to the diplomatic skill of Maedhros.\n For the greater part of the First Age, the oath kept the sons of\nFëanor united in one cause: to defeat Morgoth and retrieve the\nSilmarils, for so long as the jewels remained in the hands of the Dark\nLord, they were irretrievable by force. And so the oath slumbered, as by\nfighting Morgoth, even hopelessly, the brothers were still technically\nattempting to fulfill it.\n\nHowever, the terrible dangers of the oath became apparent when Beren and\nLúthien managed to recover one of the jewels from Morgoth. Now that\nthe jewel was no longer in Morgoth's hands, it became possible for the\nbrothers to retrieve it and genuinely fulfill the oath. Beren gave the\nSilmaril to King Thingol of Doriath who had demanded it as a bride-price\nfor his daughter, believing that Beren could not possibly retrieve one.\nWhen the sons of Fëanor learned of this, they demanded its surrender.\nHowever, Thingol was insulted by the demand and had begun to lust for\nthe Silmaril. He refused their request, and Curufin and Celegorm openly\nthreatened to destroy Doriath. This threat was the cause of considerable\nturmoil and resulted in much grief, for Maedhros was attempting at the\ntime to forge a coalition between the various Elven kingdoms to engage\nin a final, decisive strike against Morgoth's power. The threat caused\nThingol to close his borders and send no aid to the military alliance.\nThough the Elves would not have had the power in any circumstance to\noverthrow Morgoth, the loss of Thingol's aid proved detrimental to the\nalliance. After the Elven defeat during Nírnaeth Arnoediad, a series of\nunfortunate events led to the death of King Thingol and the\ndisappearance of Queen Melian, who returned to Valinor in grief. With\nher departure, the Girdle of Melian, which had protected Doriath from\nattack, faded. Beren and Lúthien's son, Dior, was crowned King of\nDoriath. He likewise refused to surrender the jewel, and the brothers\nattacked Doriath and sacked the halls of the Sindar, committing the\nsecond kin-slaying. However, the Silmaril escaped the destruction of\nDoriath and the oath drove the sons onwards. Eventually, they learned\nthat it it had come into the possession of Elwing, who dwelt near the\nmouths of Sirion. They attacked the and slaughtered the defenseless\nexiles of Gondolin and Doriath, committing the third and most terrible\nkin-slaying.\n\nBut the Silmaril escaped them again and was borne by Eärendil into the\nWest. That Silmaril was forever lost to the sons of Fëanor but two more\nremained in the crown of Morgoth. With the complete destruction of the\nElven kingdoms of Beleriand, it seemed impossible that these would ever\nsee the light of day again. However, Eärendil convinced the Valar to\ntake pity on the Elves and Edain under Morgoth's power, and initiated\nthe War of Wrath. This war saw Morgoth's power utterly overthrown, and\nthe two remaining Silmarils were wrested from him. However, most of the\nsons of Fëanor had been slain in battle, and no few of them during the\nkinslayings by their victims. The only brothers to survive the third and\nfinal kinslaying were Maedhros and Maglor. They demanded the Silmarils\nfrom Eönwë, the standard bearer of Manwë, but because of the wicked\ndeeds they had committed in the name of retrieving it, they were denied.\nBy now sick at heart of keeping the dreadful oath, neither particularly\nwanted anything more to do with the Silmarils, and Maglor openly opposed\nattempting to retrieve them. However, Maedhros convinced him to help him\nlay hands upon the jewels, claiming that because of the oath, they\nsimply had no choice. They snuck in to the camp of the victorious Host\nof the West, slew the guard around the jewels, and retrieved them. The\ncamp was roused against them, and they prepared themselves to die\ndefending their claim. But Eönwë simply permitted them to leave\nunharmed. However, due to the terrible deeds committed by the brothers\nin their retrieval of the Silmarils they found they could not handle the\nSilmarils without enduring searing pain. The two brothers parted and in\nhis anguish Maedhros threw himself and his Silmaril into a fiery chasm.\nMaglor on the other hand tossed his Silmaril into the sea and was said\nto wander the coast forever after lamenting his loss and pain.\n\n\nThe Oath\n\nThe Oath itself, as given in _Morgoth's Ring_, is as follows:\n\n “Be he foe or friend, be he foul or clean Brood of Morgoth or bright\nVala, Elda or Maia or Aftercomer, Man yet unborn upon Middle-earth,\nNeither law, nor love, nor league of swords, Dread nor danger, not Doom\nitself Shall defend him from Fëanáro, and Fëanáro’s kin, Whoso hideth or\nhoardeth, or in hand taketh, Finding keepeth or afar casteth A Silmaril.\nThis swear we all… Death we will deal him ere Day’s ending, Woe unto\nworld’s end! Our word hear thou, Eru Allfather! To the everlasting\nDarkness doom us if our deed faileth… On the holy mountain hear in\nwitness and our vow remember, Manwë and Varda!\""

His dwellings were built south by the feet of the mountains of\nValinor, upon the confines of the realm. Aulë had made Lorien's halls\nof mist gathered beyond Avathar upon the Shadowy Seas. His hall was\ngreat and dimly lit and had wide gardens which wandered marvelously\nabout, winding near to the feet of Telperion whose shining lit them. The\ngardens were full of labyrinths and mazes, for Yavanna had given Lórien\na great wealth of yew trees and cedars, and of pines that exuded drowsy\naromas in the dusk, and these hung over deep pools. Bright glowworms\ncrept about their borders and Varda had set stars within their depths\nfor the pleasure of Irmo. His Maiar servants sang wonderfully in these\ngardens and the scent of nightflowers and the songs of sleepy\nnightingales filled them with great loveliness. There too grew the\npoppies glowing red in the dusk, and those the Valar called Fumellar;\nthe flowers of sleep. In the middle of his gardens was set a ring of\nshadowy cypress reaching high above the cauldron Silindrin where Irmo,\ngazing upon it, saw many visions of mystery pass upon its face.

    "text": "ENGLAND was J.R.R. Tolkien's home country. Parts of the land such as\nSarehole were the inspiration for the Shire and other parts of\nMiddle-earth.\n\n\nMythology\n\nIn Tolkien's mythology for England which evolved into Middle-earth\nlegendarium;\n\nEriol or Ælfwine is an English mariner of the ‘Anglo-Saxon’ period who,\nsailing far westwards over the ocean, came at last to Tol Eressëa, the\nLonely Isle, where dwelt Elves who had departed from ‘the Great Lands’,\nafterwards ‘Middle-Earth’. During his sojourn in Tol Eressëa he learned\nfrom them the true and ancient history of the Creation, of the Gods, of\nthe Elves, and of England.\n\nEngland (ANGOL, LUTHANY, LUTHIEN, LEITHIAN, LEITHIEN, INGOLONDE,\nENGALAND, ONGULCYNNE) is an island of Arda (Earth) in some versions of\nTolkien's mythology. In general it lies next to Ireland (Isle of Ivren,\nHibernia, Erin) and is located within Britain (aka Leithian, Luthian,\nLuthien).Which is entering considering that Leithien/Luthien had several\nmeanings for Tolkien, including name of elf princes, an alternate name\nfor England, and also “release/release from bondage” (see Lay of\nLeithian).\n\nThe geographical context of England changes depending on the version\nwithin development. Sometimes Ælfwine leaves from England (and this is\nthe case in much of the late stories concerning the mariner and\nPengolod).\n\nIn some stories England lies off the coast of the Outer Lands (Great\nLands of the East/Middle-earth) where it was brought there by the Gods,\nor was shattered during the war of the Gods (creating several islands\nincluding nearby Ireland). But became home of elves. In some stories\nthis island is associated with Tol Eressëa and is located to the far\nWest, in sight of Valinor.\n\nSometimes its just an island off the main coast of Middle-earth (perhaps\nwest of Forodwaith. But with Middle-earth as seen as the north continent\nof Earth (_Arda_) in an imaginary period of the Earth's past (Tolkien\nplaced the end of the Third Age at about 6,000 years before his own\ntime), in the sense of a “secondary or sub-creational reality”.\nIts general position is reminiscent of Europe, with the environs of the\nShire intended to be reminiscent of England (more specifically, the West\nMidlands, with Hobbiton set at the same latitude as Oxford).\n\nWhile Tolkien never fully dropped the idea of Arda being 'earth' even\ninto the late 1970s, he became less concerned with maintaining\nconsistent 'geography' (though he did experiment with both flat earth\nand round earth versions of his tales, and in later sources the\nconnections between locations in Arda and on modern earth became more\nabstract (continental Hobbiton and Rivendell for example being part of\nEngland, roughly the latitude of Oxford, yet not being on an island, and\nMinas Tirith being at the latitude of modern Florence, and Pelargir\nlocated close to the same spot as ancient Troy).\n"

It was\npublished in 1983 in _The Monsters and the Critics_.\n\nThis paper is widely regarded as a formative work in early 20th century\n_Beowulf_ studies; some claim that without it, the poem, _Beowulf_,\nmight not be studied today. In this talk, Tolkien speaks against critics\nwho play down the fantastic elements of the poem (Grendel, Grendel's\nMother, the dragon, etc.) in favor of using _Beowulf_ solely as a source\nfor Anglo-Saxon history. Tolkien argues that rather than being merely\nextraneous, these elements are key to the narrative and should be the\nfocus of study. Later critics who disagreed with Tolkien on this point\nhave routinely had to cite him and systematically defend their\narguments.\n\nThis lecture is available in several book forms including:\n\nNicholson, Lewis E.

Inns were always counted on as being able to sell various\nalcoholic beverages and good hot meals for weary travellers, which\nattracted Men, Dwarves, and Hobbits, eager for a pint and a bite. Elves\nwere more interested in the selections of good wine, which were not\nalways served in their best state at Inns.\n\nThe Prancing Pony was one of the most detailed Inns in Middle-earth. It\nwas in the town of Bree, and was the most well known Inn around that\narea. It served as a station for relaying messages between such\nimportant figures as Gandalf and Aragorn, during the Quest of the Ring.\nIt also was the meeting place of many Rangers throughout Eriador, and\nwhile Frodo Baggins resided there, he indeed met Aragorn, one of the\nRangers of the North.\n\nThus, no town in the lands of Men and Hobbits was complete without an\nInn."

Its waters are often claimed to\nhave been saltwater, but this is not supported in any of Tolkien's\nwritings. Its waters were likely used for irrigation purposes to water\nthe fields of Nurn.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, King Elessar granted the lands around Núrnen\nto the freed slaves of Mordor.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn _The Atlas of Middle-earth_, Karen Wynn Fonstad assumed that the Sea\nof Rhûn and Sea of Núrnen were the remnants of the inland Sea of Helcar.\nThe atlas was however published before _The Peoples of Middle-earth_,\nwhere it was revealed that the Sea of Rhûn existed already in the First\nAge, as an apparently different body of water than the Sea of Helcar."

He later brought her to\nhis home north of the river and every summer would gather water-lilies\nfor her along the river side. He was on his last trip of the year when\nhe met Frodo Baggins and the rest of his company on September 26, 3018. \n\nWhen Frodo, Sam, Merry andPippin were passing through the valley of the\nWithywindle, they encountered Old Man Willow, an ancient tree who showed\nbitter hatred to all other living creatures in Middle-earth people and\ntrees alike. The Hobbits were lulled to sleep under his spell all except\nFrodo and Sam who regained consciousness in time to save Merry and\nPippin who had been trapped inside the old willow's trunk. Tom Bombadil\nhappened to be strolling along the river at the time and rescued them\nall by demanding that he let them go. He was the only person that could\ncontrol the evil tree's temper.\n\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to _The Atlas of Middle-earth_, it was about three miles in\nlength and began at a waterfall that probably cut into the cliff at the\nedge of the Barrow-downs near the house of Tom Bombadil. \n\nAt the mouth of the Withywindle there was a haven in the north bank\ncalled Grindwall. The Grindwall was not under the protection of the High\nHay therefore it was guarded by a fence that was built extending into\nthe waters shallows. There was a small village called Breredon on the\nother side of the Grindwall between the Brandywine and the High Hay.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word _withy_ means'' 'willow''' (common element in English\nplace-names) and _windle_ meaning SPINDLE or REEL and is supposed to be\ntranslated from Hobbitish."

Despite suffering severe losses, the Last Alliance leveled\nSauron's fortress and wiped out his armies after a brutal siege, during\nwhich Sauron's Ring was chopped from his finger.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nAfter the bloody Battle of Dagorlad, the Last Alliance began their\ninvasion into Mordor. They captured the Black Gate but lost many as they\npassed through Udûn, a plateau north of Mordor, and they failed to break\ninto the Dark Tower. Thus, they laid siege on the Dark Tower.\n\nThe siege lasted for a total of seven years. Many elves and men were\nkilled in the siege as seemingly endless numbers of arrows, rocks,\nflaming missiles, and Orc sorties emerged from the tower. Fortunately,\nAnárion's army from Gondor managed to reinforce the Last Alliance. On\nthe sixth year of the siege, SA 3440, Anárion was hit in the head by a\nstone and died. A year later, Gil-galad and Elendil duelled Sauron on\nthe slopes of Mount Doom. Sauron, however, was much more powerful, and\nkilled first Gil-galad with the heat of his hand, and then Elendil, as\nElrond, Círdan, and Isildur helplessly watched. As Elendil fell, his\ngreat sword Narsil broke beneath him. But Sauron had been mortally\nwounded in the battle, and when Isildur cut the One Ring from Sauron's\nbody his spirit fled.\n\nAfter the battle, Sauron's body was broken, the tower of Barad-dûr\ncollapsed (without the Ring's destruction the foundations remained), and\nthe Orc hosts were in disarray. Elrond led Isildur into the heart of\nMount Doom, where the One Ring was forged, and the only place it could\nbe destroyed. However, he claimed it for his own, which led to his\ndeath.\n\nGondor later reoccupied Minas Ithil and Ithilien, and set watchtowers at\nthe Black Gate, and the pass of Cirith Ungol. However, years of neglect,\nand the Kin-strife led these areas to be captured by the Nazgûl, with\nMinas Ithil, later Minas Morgul, falling to the Witch-king.\n\nIsildur's father, brother, and Gil-galad were killed in the Siege of\nBarad-dûr.",

They were seen as 'odd folk' by the other Hobbits of the Shire\nbecause they locked their doors at night (because of the exposure to the\nOld Forest). It should also be noted that the Brandybucks were not only\nthe most wary hobbit clan, but also one of the most organized in matters\nof militia. After the Ringwraiths invaded Frodo's house in Buckland, the\nmilitia was roused with the call of “Fear, Fire, Foes, Awake!” the\nmilitia of Buckland arrived, though the Ringwraiths escaped by riding\nthrough the front barricades of Buckland. This proves that the\nBrandybucks were not idle in matters of defense, perhaps due to their\nproximity to the Old Forest, and the attack of the White Wolves over the\nfrozen Brandywine River. Two instances in which the Brandybucks were\ncapable of fending off the rare (Though Minor) dangers that threatened\nthe shire.\n\n\nMasters of Buckland\n\nThe head of the family was the _Master of Buckland_, one of the\nofficials of the Shire. Gordenhad Brandybuck founded this office. Like\nthe Thain and Warden of Westmarch, the Master had only nominal\nauthority. The authority of the Master also extended across the\nBrandywine into the Marish of the Eastfarthing, due to the close\nproximity and the amount of business between the two areas.\n\n\n“Brandybuck” as a translation\n\nIt should be noted that the name _Brandybuck_ is only a translation of\nthe original Westron BRANDAGAMBA, _Marchbuck_. In keeping with the\nconcept that _The Lord of the Rings_ was derived from the translated Red\nBook of Westmarch, Tolkien translated all its Westron words into English\n— including the names of characters. See Westron for more information.\n\nde:Brandybock it:Famiglia Brandibuck pl:Brandybuckowie"

The phial emits a brilliant light in darkness.\n\nFor Samwise Gamgee - ''Earth from Galadriel's Orchard and a Mallorn Seed\n''- These are contained in a small box of grey wood with a silver G-rune\non the lid.

In\nthe movie, Galadriel presents them with daggers. \n\nFor Aragorn - _Elven Scabbard_- A magical scabbard, any sword sheathed\nin this scabbard will never break. And _Elessar the Elfstone_ - A green\ngem set in a silver eagle shaped brooch, left for him by Arwen. In the\nmovie, Aragorn does not receive either of these, as Arwen has already\ngiven him the film's equivalent gem; Elrond will later present him a\nscabbard with Andúril, though no indication is given that it is magical.\nInstead, Celeborn gives him a curved Elvish hunting knife.\n\nFor Legolas - _Bow of the Galadhrim with\nArrows_ - A great bow crafted deep in Lothlorien and strung with\nelf-hair.\n\nFor Gimli - _Three Strands of Galadriel's hair_ - Overwhelmed by\nGaladriel's great beauty, Gimli could think of nothing else he wanted\nbut a single strand of her hair. Galadriel gave him three. Gimli wished\nto encase this gift in imperishable crystal, as an heirloom of his house\nand a sign of good will between the Dwarves and Elves.\n\nFor Boromir - A solid gold belt crafted in Lórien, shaped like linked\ngolden leaves.\n\nFor all the Fellowship of the Ring (characters) - _Elven Cloaks_ - It is\nworth note that The Fellowship received Elven cloaks from Galadriel\nwhich helped hide them from unfriendly eyes. The cloaks were personally\nwoven by Galadriel and her maidens. The brooches were in the form of a\ngreen leaf veined with silver. The only notable exception to those who\ndidn't receive a cloak was Gandalf, who at the time, was presumed dead\nat the hands of Durin's Bane.

Around his twentieth year, as he\nwalked in the woods singing a part of the Lay of Lúthien, he witnessed\nthe beauty of Arwen for the first time, clad in a mantle of silver and\nblue. Mistaking her for Lúthien, he called to her by that name, and,\nfrom that moment on, loved only her. Gilraen warned Aragorn of the folly\nof his love for Arwen, a high-born Elf such as she was. Aragorn soon\nleft Rivendell, and for thirty years fought against Sauron on whatever\nfront which was deemed necessary.\n\nIn his forty-ninth year of life, after years of strife and toil, he\nwished, once again, to be at peace. He came into Lórien, not knowing\nthat Arwen also was there, and stayed with her for a season. “And thus\nit was that Arwen first beheld him again after their long parting; and\nas he came walking towards her under the trees of Caras Galadhon laden\nwith flowers of gold, her choice was made and her doom appointed.” On\nCerin Amroth, in the midst of Lórien they plighted their troth looking\ntoward the shadow of the east and the twilight of the west.\n\nAfter The War of the Ring, Arwen and Aragorn were married and spent\nsix-score years in bliss. As Aragorn felt his life drawing to a close,\nhe came to Arwen, saying, “In sorrow we must go, but not in despair.\nBehold! we are not bound for ever to the circles of the world, and\nbeyond them is more than memory.”\n\nAfter he passed from the world in the House of the Kings, she bid\nfarewell to Eldarion and her daughters, and went out of Minas Tirith to\nLórien and, “dwelt there alone under the fading trees until winter\ncame.” Sometime before the Spring she laid herself down upon Cerin\nAmroth, and there she would lie until the world's ending."

Tolkien.\n\n\nIn Middle-earth\n\nDwarves\n\nOnly seen by some of the members of Thorin and Company, in _The Hobbit._\n\nElves\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Elven archers from Lórien use large bows of Mallorn wood strung with\nelf-hair. Their arrows were almost four feet long and usually made of\nash with a tip made of gold and shaped like a Mallorn leaf. They used a\nspiral method of fletching (attaching feathers to the arrow shaft), thus\nmaking their arrows more accurate, up to a quarter mile.\n\nLegolas was the most renowned archer throughout the Third Age. Earlier\nin his journey with the Fellowship of the Ring, he used a bow from\nMirkwood, and it was later replaced by the bow of the Galadhrim Lady\nGaladriel gave him.\n\nGondorian\n\n\n\nThe Gondorian army contains units of archers who use a longbow. The bows\nare made of heartwood, about 68 inches tall. The arrows are about 28\ninches long with four-inch steel tips. They are accurate up to 200\nyards. The longbowmen of the army wear their quiver (the case that holds\nthe arrows) on their hips rather than on their backs like most archers,\nsuch as Legolas and Haldir.\n\nRangers of Ithilien\n\nThe Rangers of Ithilien were primarily archers. They used a simple\nlongbow, often made of yew, likely up to 80 inches in length. Their\narrows would have averaged about 28 inches in length with a steel tip\nwith consistent accuracy up to 200 yards.\n\nRohirrim\n\nRohan included archers in its militia. They used shortbows, possibly\nbecause they fought mounted on horses and a longer bow might get in the\nway. The shortbows were much less powerful than those used by their\nallies, having probably a range of only 125 yards. Their arrows were\nunique in having a cutout in the heads; this cut down on weight & the\namount of metal used while still allowing the arrowheads to have a\nlarger surface area, which would cause a larger wound. Another unique\naspect of the arrows was that they were fletched with leather.\n\n_Note: Information comes from “The Lord of the Rings: Weapons and\nWarfare” by Chris Smith._\n\nHaradrim and Easterlings\n\n\n\nThe Haradrim (Southrons) were also skilled archers, along with their\nallies the Easterlings. The Haradrim were masters of archery and had\nexpert snipers positioned on the feared Mumakil. Their bows were short,\npossibly made of composite materials and by the time of the War of the\nRing, could possibly have been compound, making them extremely deadly.\nThe Easterlings are mentioned several times in the books as having\nscores of mounted archers. The horse archers were among the deadliest in\nMiddle Earth, far exceeding the skill of the Rohirrim and Haradrim. The\nEasterlings also had many foot archers weilding both longbows and\nrecurve bows.\n\nOrcs\n\n\n\nOrcs and Goblins were often seen carrying bows, but are also viewed as\npoor handlers of the weapon. Their bows can range from being as tall as\nan Uruk to relatively short. The maximum effective ranges included 50\nand 100 yards. Orc arrows were usually tipped with poison or barbed, so\neven a glancing hit could be fatal.\n\nHobbits\n\nThe Hobbits were not a warring people, but their best unit in times of\nwar are their archers. During the reign of the last King of Arnor before\nits dispansion the first time, hobbits sent archers to his aid as was\nagreed when they moved to live in Arnor. Hobbit archers were also\nresponsible for the death of Grima Wormtongue.﻿\n\n\nMost notable archers\n\n-   Beleg\n-   Legolas\n-   Bard \n"

This stone hill was the foundation for the\ncity Gondolin built by Turgon. Tumladen and the city it contained\nremained secret and safe for 503 years since the Return of the Ñoldor to\nMiddle-earth. It was, however, betrayed by the father of Túrin Turambar,\nHúrin Thalion, when Húrin shouted at the mountains encircling the city\nto let Turgon know to open the gates and let him in (this was an\nill-fated attempt, for no one heard him, and Húrin despaired). As Húrin\nwas under the spell of Morgoth, the Dark Lord finally learned of\nGondolin's location through Húrin. In this way, Húrin doomed the city.\nMorgoth waited for a couple more years before he finally invaded the\ncity, with the help of the traitor Maeglin, who showed him where the\nvale could be found exactly and how it could be attacked (since Great\nEagles guarded its borders). Through his treachery, Maeglin help to lie\nwaste the fair vale of Tumladen and the city that sat on Amon Gwareth in\nthe center of the vale, Gondolin.\n\n\nDescription\n\nTumladen was described by J.R.R. Tolkien as a “...green jewel among the\nencircling hills...” and as a “...green plain among the mountains.” He\nalso describes it as being very fair with the black and smooth Amon\nGwareth in the center of the vale.\n\n\nHistory\n\nTumladen was a great lake in the ancient days of Beleriand. It was\nlocated east of the upper waters of Sirion, as was found out later by\nthe Elves, in the middle of the Encircling Mountains. Turgon was shown\nby Ulmo, a Vala, where it was located by means of a dark tunnel that ran\ndeep under the mountains, hollowed out by streams that ran to join the\nSirion. In this way, Turgon discovered the vale of Tumladen, and thought\nit indeed to be a perfect place to construct his city that was supposed\nto be modeled after the great city of Tirion upon the green hill Tuna,\nback in Valinor. Indeed, after many years of labor, Gondolin did come to\nrival Tirion with its beauty and splendor. As mentioned above, Tumladen\nand the city it held, Gondolin, survived for more than 503 years, the\nlongest lasting of the Ñoldorin kingdoms. The vale was betrayed, as\nmentioned above, by Maeglin and in so doing, Maeglin finally destroyed\nthe last kingdom of the Ñoldor in Beleriand. It was there that the\nbattle of Ecthelion of the Fountain and Gothmog, the Lord of Balrogs,\ntook place in the very square of the King. There it was also that they\nslew each other, and in so doing, Ecthelion had felled the mightiest of\nBalrogs, even though he himself had died also. And so, with the\ntreachery of Maeglin, the fair vale of Tumladen and the city upon Amon\nGwareth, Gondolin, the last kingdom of the Ñoldor, were destroyed and\nruined.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Tumladen_ is a name coming from two Sindarin roots. One of the roots is\n_tum_ (pronounced _toom_), which means a valley. The other Sindarin root\nis _lad_, which means a plain or a valley. Both parts of this name\ndoubly imply and tell that Tumladen is a plain/valley, a very\ninteresting combination of Sindarin roots on the part of Tolkien.\n\n\nOther\n\nIn the Third Age, Tumladen was a valley near the southeastern end of the\nWhite Mountains. When Pippin arrived in Minas Tirith, he saw vehicles\ncarrying the old, the children and the women to take refuge in Lebennin\nthrough the vales Tumladen, Lossarnach, and the mountain-villages.\nTumladen was placed at the source of River Sirith in _The Atlas of\nMiddle-earth_."

The sceptre of the Kings was lost with Ar-Pharazôn in\nthe destruction of Númenor in 3319 of the Second Age. But Elendil,\nthe last Lord of Andúnië, took his sceptre with him when he escaped from\nNúmenor and came to Middle-earth and founded the Kingdoms of Gondor and\nArnor. While the Kings of Gondor wore a crown, the Kings of Arnor bore\nthe sceptre. It became known as the Sceptre of Annúminas, the original\ncapital of the North-kingdom. After the North-kingdom was divided in 861\nthe sceptre passed to the Kings of Arthedain, and then, after Arthedain\nceased to exist in 1974, to the Chieftains of the Dúnedain. Since the\nDúnedain were a wandering people, the sceptre and other heirlooms were\nkept at Rivendell, home of Elrond.\n\nBy the end of the Third Age, the Sceptre of Annúminas was over 5,000\nyears old and was the oldest artifact of Men in Middle-earth, barring\nthe Ring of Barahir which was gifted to Barahir by the Elven king Finrod\nFelagund in the First Age as a symbol of the eternal friendship between\nmen and elves.

    "title": "Gift of Men",
    "page_id": "7687",
    "text": "The GIFT OF MEN refers to a gift of Ilúvatar to his Younger Children,\nwhich remains a source of some confusion for Tolkien enthusiasts. The\nconcept includes both mortality, leading to death of old age, and free\nwill. Below are two interpretations of the nature and extent of the Gift\nof Men as articulated by Tolkien.\n\n\nA spiritual/theological view of the Gift of Men\n\nThe _Gift of Men_ was an act of the Supreme Being Ilúvatar that set the\nrace of Men apart from the Elves. While the race of Elves would know the\nmost bliss and contentment and would conceive more beauty than any\nothers of the Children of Ilúvatar, it was decreed by this gift that Men\nwould be the prime instruments of Ilúvatar within Arda.\n\nIlúvatar willed that the spirits/hearts of Men are not content within\nArda, and find no rest therein, and therefore seek beyond the world and\nits confines. They are not bound to the Circles of the World, as the\nElves and all other creatures of Arda are bound to the Earth. The\nspirits of Men truly leave the physical world, and do not return. Thus\ntheir fates are completely sundered from that of the Elves, who do not\ndie until the world dies, unless slain by violence or ill chance, or by\nwearying at the last of the passage of centuries. But as the years grow\nlong and Time wears, even the Valar will come to envy the gift of\nIlúvatar to the race of Men, that of liberation from the physical world,\nand the inevitability of loss and sorrows that must come with this\nexistence within Arda.\n\nMoreover, it is also a consequence of this true spiritual freedom of not\nbeing bound to either the ordinance of Fate, or the confines of the\nWorld that the spirits of Men do not dwell long in Arda, and after what\nseems to be a very short time to the immortal Elves, men age, grow\nweary, and die.\n\nHowever, a key aspect of this gift of living within Arda for a short\ntime was a virtue instilled into the race of Men to be motivated to\ncreate destinies for themselves amidst the powers and chances of the\nworld. Men were able to shape their lives _beyond_ the Music of the\nAinur, which rules the fates of all other things in Arda. Men may choose\nto live in tune with the themes of the Music that created Arda, or be\nindifferent to it, or live in defiance of it.\n\nIlúvatar understood that Men would not always use this gift of freedom\nin harmony with the world, and would stray often. But he knew that in\ntheir time, men would continue to order their lives within Arda and by\ntheir _“operation everything should be, in form and deed, completed, and\nthe world fulfilled unto the last and the smallest”_ (_The\nSilmarillion_). Thus Men would become the implements by which Ilúvatar's\nplans for Arda will be realized in the ages to come.\n\nThe Gift, as originally bequeathed, was not something that Men feared.\nThough they loved their lives within Arda, they relinquished their\nspirits gracefully, almost gladly, and seemed to pass into a peaceful\nsleep, never to wake again in this life. But their souls go to a place\nunknown to the wisest of Elves or even the Valar.\n\nHowever it is written that when the Second Music of the Ainur is played,\nafter the Dagor Dagorath, the spirits of Men shall be included in this\neven greater theme, when all of the players will know and understand\ntheir part and its relation to the whole, and be tributary to its beauty\nand glory.\n\n\nAvoidance of the Gift of Men\n\nThe shadow of the first Dark Lord brought with it a perversion of the\noriginal intent of the Gift of Ilúvatar, and brought fear out of hope,\nand tainted the Gift. Men began to fear and despise the gift, and began\nto view it not as liberation, but as damnation. It brought about in the\nrace of Men a kind of self-loathing and a denial of the basic nature of\ntheir being as the children of the All-Father Eru Ilúvatar. Instead they\nviewed themselves as flawed in some way and sought to resist this very\nintrinsic nature of their creation. The result of such actions brought\nabout much anguish on the race of Men through the centuries of the\nhistory of Arda.\n\nAt least four characters in _The Lord of the Rings_ are examples of the\ndangers of either deliberately or unintentionally trying to avoid the\nGift of Men. Three of them are transformed into “monsters” by being\ndenied the Gift of Men by sins that they have committed: the Lord of the\nNazgûl (and all of the Nazgûl), the King of the Dead, and Sméagol.\n(Since Sméagol is a Hobbit-like creature, he is numbered among the\nYounger Children of Ilúvatar, and as such is entitled to the strange\nGift of Men.) The Nazgûl are made immortal, but also doomed, by the Nine\nRings. The King of the Dead is transformed into a ghost or monster by\nthe curse of Isildur, because he and his subjects break an oath to fight\nagainst Sauron. Long after his natural death, he fulfils his oath, and\nis released from his condition by Aragorn. (This presumably also applies\nto the other Dead.) Sméagol is consumed by the Ring; over the years, its\ninfluence transforms him from a Hobbit into the freakish Gollum.\n\nBilbo Baggins, like Sméagol, is a Hobbit rather than a Man, but Hobbits\nare also among the Younger Children of Ilúvatar, and are therefore\nrecipients of the Gift of Men. Bilbo encounters Gollum in his cave and\nescapes with the Ring. Being a Hobbit of much better character than\nSméagol, Bilbo better resists the negative effects of possessing the One\nRing. He does not appear to age considerably, but has a sense of\nbecoming “thin and stretched.” Toward the end of his possession of the\nRing, Bilbo begins to show some of the obsessive tendencies of Gollum —\ncalling the Ring “my precious,” and showing flashes of dark hostility\nwhen asked by Gandalf to give the Ring to his heir, Frodo. After the\nRings destruction, Bilbo's appearance begins to show signs of age and\nweariness.\n\nThose Men with the greatest understanding treated death as the Gift it\nwas originally intended to be, and when their time came gladly gave\nthemselves up to it. We see this, for example, in the earlier Kings of\nNúmenor, and Aragorn also accepted the Gift at the natural end of his\nlife. For most Men, though, the Gift was tainted by Morgoth, and they\ncame to fear it rather than embrace it. This fear reached its peak in\nthe later years of Númenor, where even the long life given to the\nNúmenóreans was not enough, and wise men did all they could to try to\nescape death altogether. In the end, this desperation led to Númenor's\ndestruction when Ar-Pharazôn led a battle fleet to the Undying Lands,\nhaving been convinced by Sauron's lies that they held the key to the\nimmortality of the Elves. This deception and treachery eventually saw\nthe lifespans of Men return to more normal times. Even after millennia,\nthe descendants of Numenor still possessed some extended lifespans\nbeyond typical Men; these men became known as the Dúnedain. de:Gabe der\nMenschen it:Fato degli Uomini"

Later, a high orc-chieftain clothed in black mail with a spear\nand a scimitar rushed into the Chamber. He was slain by Andúril when he\nswept out the scimitar after his spear was broken and hacked by Sam. At\nthe flight of the Fellowship, Frodo saw that nearly hundreds of orcs\nbrandished scimitars and spears in the firelight in the First Hall near\nthe Bridge of Khazad-dum.\n\nThe goblin-soldiers of Isengard did use short broad-bladed swords\ninstead of curved scimitars which was unusual for Orcs. Aragorn\ndistinguished four of them from the slain, and he knew Orcs from the\nNorth normally wielded scimitars.\n\nThe Orcs of Mordor have made straight blades too, and their blade are\nlonger than Isengarders. Grishnákh carried a black knife with a long\njagged blade. Shagrat had a long red knife, and he drove this knife into\nGorbag's throat.\n\n\nHaradrim\n\nThe Haradrim are the civilization most commonly described as using\nscimitars, with their cavalry bringing scimitars onto the Pelennor. In\nthe books, their scimitars were “like a glitter of stars”, but in the\nmovies the only metal they have are gold plates worn as trophies.\nThrough a movie standpoint, the Haradrim would have likely made these\nscimitars by combining a stone, bone, or obsidian blade with a wood,\nstone, or bone handle. These scimitars can typically be 3 foot 6 inch in\nlength, with the blade being blunt for the first 10 inches to avoid\nself-laceration (exposing 4 inches of blunt blade and 30 inches of sharp\nblade)\n\n\nEtymology\n\nTolkien uses the term “scimitar” to describe any curved blade existing\nin Middle-earth. However, there are other kinds of curved blades,\nincluding forwards-curving ones like the Kopis and the Falcutta. Some\nbackwards-curving blades do not count as scimitars in swordsmanship, but\nin the case of Middle-earth as Tolkien describes it, _any_ curved blade\nis a scimitar. The scimitar in the picture is actually a falchion; a\nscimitar is a backwards-curving blade on a J-shaped handle with a\ncross-guard that curved up on the sharp side and down on the dull side.\nThe blade curve was asymmetrical to the handle curve."

It spanned a deep abyss by way of a\nlong iron bridge and then ran westward for a league (3 miles) across\nGorgoroth.\n\n\n\nOn either side of the road were smoking chasms. At the foot of Mount\nDoom, Sauron's Road climbed a long causeway up the eastern slopes. The\nroad then wound upwards around the mountain, turning first south then\nwest then north and back to the east.\n\nThe road encircled the base of the mountain, which was 3,000 feet high,\nand then ran partway up the cone, which rose another 1,500 feet. It\nended at the door to the Chambers of Fire on the east side of Mount Doom\nfacing the Window of the Eye in Barad-dûr. Sauron's Road was a broad\npath paved with ash and broken rubble.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIt was probably created in the late sixteenth century of the Second Age\nwhen Sauron sought to control the other rings by creating the One Ring,\nusing it as an easy way to get to and from the mountain during his\nlabors. Over the long ages it was frequently blocked and ruined by the\nravages of the erupting volcano, but it was always repaired.\n\nFrodo and Sam used part of this road to get up the mountain during their\nquest to destroy the ring when on March 25, 3019 of the Third Age, Sam\ncarried Frodo up the northern slopes of Mount Doom until he found\nSauron's Road leading to their destination. “'Why, it might have been\nput there a-purpose!' he said to himself.

It was\nexclusively applied to the House of Finwë.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe title came in being at about the time that the elves undertook their\nGreat Journey to Aman with Finwë being its first. The title continued in\nMiddle-earth after the Ñoldor returned in pursuit of Morgoth. Fëanor or\nthe eldest of his sons could have claimed the title but with his death\nMaedhros waived his claim to the title and ceded it to House of\nFingolfin, out of respect and friendship with them. There were four\nlegitimate High Kings in Middle-earth beginning with Fingolfin and\nending with Gil-galad at the end of Second Age, lasting over\nfour-thousand years. Turgon's relatives Eärendil and then Elrond could\nhave made a claim to the title but never did. It is possible that the\nHigh Kingship passed exclusively through the male line; if this is the\ncase, then the title became effectively extinct with the death of\nGil-galad in Middle-earth. Eärendil and his descendants belonged to the\nhuman House of Hador.\n\n\nSuccession\n\nThe succession of the kingship was never planned, likely because Elves\ncould not die and there would be no need for succession. But in the\nworse case, the Elves followed the rule that the eldest child should\nsucceed. Such was the case with Fëanor, who immediately claimed the\ntitle after Finwe's death at the hands of Morgoth. But he could not\ncommand the same respect, for greater love was given to Fingolfin for\nhis wisdom and leadership, and the Ñoldor of Tirion refused to renounce\nhim.\n\nAfter the death of Fëanor, Maedhros was due to succeed by right, yet in\nrepentance of his father's acts he waived his claim to Fingolfin. This\nmove was recognised by all, and the Kingship belonged solely to the\nHouse of Fingolfin. Fingon was the elder son who succeeded his father.\nStrangely however, after Fingon's demise he was not succeeded by his son\nGil-galad, but by Turgon his brother. Once again this would suggest\nloyalty and respect in such a decision, as Turgon was older and more\nexperienced at the time. Nevertheless, the kingship passed back to\nGil-galad after Turgon's fall.\n\n\nKnown High Kings of the Ñoldor\n\nIn Aman\n\n-   Finwë (undisputed)\n\nIn Aman only\n\n-   Finarfin\n\nIn Middle-earth\n\n-   Fëanor (de jure only)\n-   Maedhros (never crowned)\n-   Fingolfin\n-   Fingon\n-   Turgon\n-   Gil-galad (the last in Middle-earth)"

After\nhis decline and fall, his successor Sauron continued his works of evil\nuntil he too was defeated.\n\nDarkness and Men\n\nOf all the races in Arda, Men were the easiest to corrupt and drive into\ntemptation and thus were most afflicted by the Darkness.

Then Sauron came\nand was soon the master of the King's council and men fell ever further\ninto the Shadow, convincing many of the faithless to worship Morgoth in\nthe everlasting Darkness beyond. Here the chief hurt was that men grew\nafraid of death, a fear that lingered on all men. The embassy from\nValinor speculated that this was the first sign of the shadow in\nNumenor. Afterwards, Darkness continued to compel men to follow its\nbanner serving both themselves and Sauron even after his defeat in the\nWar of the Ring.\n\nIt is possible that this is the “shadow” Gandalf is referring to when he\ncommands Durin’s Bane to “Go back to the shadow!”.\n\nLegacy of Darkness\n\nMarring its original design, the advent of Darkness has brought the\nworld its greatest woe but has brought many together who opposed it.

    "title": "Realms in Exile",
    "page_id": "9887",
    "text": "'REALMS IN EXILE' was the collective name for the kingdoms, Arnor and\nGondor, established by the Dunedain in Middle-earth after they escaped\nthe Downfall of Númenor. For much of the Third Age, they were the\ndominant powers in the north-west of Middle-earth, and had an enduring\npolitical, economic and cultural significance. Initially politically\nunited, they soon became separate kingdoms, but retained much of their\ncommon culture, and later entered into an alliance. Arnor broke apart\ninto petty kingdoms, the last of which fell in TA 1974. Gondor survived\nand, though becoming ever weaker, it remained the most powerful state\namong the so-called “Free Peoples”. After the War of the Ring, Gondor\nand the former territories of Arnor were merged into the Reunited\nKingdom.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBoth Arnor and Gondor were feudal absolute monarchies. Their first High\nKing was Elendil the Tall, the leader of the fugitives who escaped\nduring the Akallabêth and a member of the old Númenórean nobility. He\nruled Arnor directly, while Gondor was ruled jointly by his sons,\nIsildur and Anárion, who acted as his vassals. As a result of the War of\nthe Last Alliance (see below), the two kingdoms were politically\nseparated; Arnor was ruled by Isildur's descendants, and Gondor by those\nof Anárion. In a departure from Númenórean practice, equal primogeniture\nwas abolished in favour of an exclusively male succession, perhaps\nbecause of the role the King had in both realms as supreme army\ncommander and the frequent wars in which the realms were embroiled.\n\nWhile Arnor and Gondor are called “the realms of the Dúnedain”, in fact\nthe Dúnedain made up only a small part of their population. The bulk of\nthe human population in the north-west of Middle-earth consisted of\nnative Men and descendants of earlier Númenórean colonists, the two\ngroups having intermingled to varying degrees. The Dúnedain who arrived\nwith Elendil and his sons, being of pure Númenórean blood and culture,\nwere more gifted and powerful than the local inhabitants. Furthermore,\nthe House of Elendil commanded particular respect and loyalty on account\nof his descent from Elros and his ancestors' leadership of the Faithful\nin Númenor itself. The Dúnedain therefore quickly established themselves\nas a sort of hereditary aristocracy, and provided many of the realms'\nleading statesmen, administrators and military commanders. However,\nlocal tribes and lordships, many held by families not of Númenórean\ndescent, persisted, especially away from the great cities. Unlike the\nearlier colonists, the Dúnedain came to discourage intermarriage with\nthose they termed “lesser Men,” fearing perhaps that their gifts would\nbe bred out; this policy eventually had disastrous consequences for\nGondor.\n\nAmong themselves, the Dúnedain spoke a dialect of Sindarin, in token of\ntheir ancient friendship with the Elves, and to set themselves apart\nfrom the hostile “Black Númenóreans” who had established lordships in\nthe more southerly regions of Middle-earth. But in dealings with their\nsubject peoples and the surrounding nations, they used Westron, a\ndescendant of the Adûnaic language of Númenor, closely related to many\nof the Mannish dialects that already prevailed in their territories. In\nthis way, Westron (which also became known as the Common Speech) became\nthe everyday language of most of the inhabitants of the realms,\nincluding later immigrants such as the Shire-folk; and even other nearby\nindependent kingdoms and peoples, who had languages of their own, chose\nWestron for their dealings with foreigners, so that it became the\nlanguage of trade and diplomacy throughout the West. The Westron was\narguably the most enduring cultural legacy of the Realms in Exile.\n\n\nHistory\n\nSecond Age\n\nArnor and Gondor were founded in SA 3320, the year after the Akallabêth.\nHowever, Sauron, who hated Elendil and his family on account of their\nfriendship with the Elves and their opposition to his policies in\nNúmenor, had survived Númenor's downfall, in which he played a leading\npart. He returned to Middle-earth, and discovered that the power of the\nElves under Gil-galad had increased in his absence, and that the Realms\nin Exile, whose territory extended even to the borders of Mordor, were\ninclined to side with the Elves in the event of war. Thus, after a\nmostly peaceful century in which Elendil ruled in the north and Isildur\nand Anárion in the south, Sauron suddenly attacked Gondor (SA 3429),\ncapturing Minas Ithil and destroying its White Tree. Isildur fled to\nArnor, while Anárion defended Osgiliath and Minas Anor. In 3430,\nGil-galad and Elendil formed the Last Alliance, initially consisting of\nthe Realms in Exile and the Elf-kingdoms of Lindon and Imladris. The\nAlliance was soon joined by the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm and the Silvan\nElves of Mirkwood and Lórien. The Allies overthrew Sauron's forces at\nthe Battle of Dagorlad, and besieged Barad-dûr for seven years; Anárion,\nalong with many others, was killed during the siege. At last, seeing no\nother way to break the siege, Sauron himself came forth, and wrestled\nwith Elendil and Gil-galad on the slopes of Mount Doom; they defeated\nhim, but both perished. Isildur cut Sauron's ring of power from his hand\nand took it for his own. Sauron passed away into the shadows and the\nSecond Age ended.\n\nThird Age\n\nWith both Elendil and Anárion dead, the organisation of the Realms in\nExile became murky. Isildur became sole King of both Gondor and Arnor,\nbut instead of seeking to rule both Kingdoms personally, he instructed\nhis nephew Meneldil, the oldest surviving son of Anárion, before making\nhim responsible for ruling Gondor. Isildur, along with his three eldest\nsons (Elendur, Aratan and Ciryon), then journeyed north, Isildur\nintending to take up the high kingship of his father in Arnor. Some two\nthousand years later, Arvedui (Isildur's remote descendant in the north)\nand the Dúnedain of Gondor disagreed as to whether Isildur relinquished\nhis rights in Gondor, or whether he merely made Meneldil responsible for\nruling Gondor under his suzerainty.\n\nWhatever Isildur's plans, they were put to a sudden end when he and his\nthree eldest sons were killed in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields. In\nthat unexpected attack by Orcs, most of Isildur's followers were killed;\nhe himself escaped, taking advantage of the Ring's power of\ninvisibility, but the Orcs tracked him to the Anduin. When he tried to\nswim across the river, the Ring slipped from his finger, and the Orcs\nsaw him and killed him with arrows. Of his entire army and entourage as\nhe journeyed north, only three eventually reached Arnor; among these was\nhis esquire, who had kept the shards of Elendil's famous sword Narsil.\nThat sword then became an heirloom of the Kingdom of Arnor.\n\nThe sceptre of Arnor now came to Valandil, the youngest of Isildur's\nfour sons, who had remained in Rivendell during the war, being still a\nchild when the Last Alliance attacked Sauron; but not until TA 10 did he\nactually assume his responsibilities. By this time, whatever Isildur's\noriginal intentions were, Meneldil in Gondor was a thoroughly\nindependent monarch, and Valandil and his successors in Arnor, badly\nweakened by Arnor's losses in the war, were in no position to exert\nauthority over Gondor, even if they had wished to do so. So it was that,\nin place of the unified entity of Elendil's day, two independent\nkingdoms arose.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that Arnor, despite its notional superiority,\nwas by now the weaker of the two realms. Although its territory\nencompassed almost all of vast Eriador, its population was severely\ndiminished and it never really recovered. In TA 861, Arnor was divided\ninto the three petty kingdoms of Arthedain, Rhudaur and Cardolan, which\nfrequently fought amongst themselves, weakening the northern Dúnedain\nstill further. About TA 1300, an evil power known as the Witch-king\nestablished the kingdom of Angmar in the mountainous wastes north of\nArthedain and Rhudaur, and proceeded to conquer the realms of the\nnorthern Dúnedain one by one. In Rhudaur, power was seized from the\nDúnedain in the 14th century by the native Hillmen, who allied\nthemselves with Angmar before eventually being annexed early in the 15th\ncentury. Cardolan was fatally weakened by a defeat at the hands of the\ncombined forces of Angmar and Rhudaur in TA 1409, and its few surviving\nDúnedain, along with most of its other inhabitants, were eventually\nwiped out in the Great Plague of TA 1636. Arthedain, the most powerful\nof the northern kingdoms and the only one in which the line of Isildur\nwas preserved, survived the longest, eventually falling to an all-out\ninvasion from Angmar in TA 1974. After the collapse of Arthedain, the\nsurviving Dúnedain became a wandering people, and secretly guarded\nEriador's few surviving settled communities, such as the Shire and Bree,\nagainst evil and wild creatures.\n\nIn the south, Gondor grew and flourished for a thousand years, gaining\nterritory to the north-east (southern Rhovanion), the north-west\n(Enedwaith) and the south (Umbar). It seems Gondor never sought to\nexpand further northwest than the Greyflood, and no records survive of\nconflict between Gondor and unified Arnor, or between Gondor and\nCardolan. But nor are there any records of alliance or friendly\ncommunication; Gondor seems rather to have been preoccupied with the\npeoples to its east and south, and with the threat of Mordor, which\nGondor guarded with a series of fortresses. Thus Gondor came to control\na vast territory by the time of Hyarmendacil I, but like Arnor it slowly\ndecayed through a combination of internal weaknesses and external\nthreats. Its Dúnedain population slowly shrank, the southern Dúnedain\ntending to marry late and have few children, so that Gondor gradually\nlost its main source of strength compared to the surrounding nations.\nDuring the second millennium of the Third Age, Gondor was hit by three\ngreat calamities. The first was the Kin-strife, a civil war brought\nabout by the marriage of King Valacar to a foreign woman and the\naccession of their son; during the Kin-strife, the Dúnedain aristocracy\nwas decimated, the great _palantír_ of Osgiliath lost, and Umbar was\nwrested from Gondor by the survivors of the rebel faction. The second,\nthe Great Plague that wreaked havoc in Cardolan (see above), had earlier\nkilled great numbers of the people of Gondor. The third calamity, a\ncentury-long war with the Wainriders, cost Gondor its eastern\nterritories and nearly exterminated the royal family.\n\nIn light of the threats of Angmar and the Wainriders, Gondor and\nArthedain made an alliance in TA 1940, the first such alliance for many\ncenturies, and cemented it by the marriage of Arvedui, heir to the\nthrone of Arthedain, and Fíriel, daughter of Ondoher of Gondor. When\nOndoher and his two sons were killed in battle with the Wainriders four\nyears later, Arvedui claimed the now vacant throne of Gondor, by virtue\nof his descent from Isildur and secondarily in right of his wife. Had\nhis claim been accepted, it seems likely that a Reunited Kingdom would\nhave emerged far earlier, and to the advantage of both North and South.\nBut the Council of Gondor, perhaps offended by his assertion of the\nrights of Isildur's descendants in Gondor, and certainly seeing the\nnorthern prince as a weak candidate, instead offered the crown to\nEärnil, the general responsible for victory over the Wainriders and a\ndistant cousin of Gondor's late King. Despite the obvious snub the\nCouncil thus offered to the northern Dúnedain, Eärnil II maintained\nGondor's alliance with Arthedain, going so far as to send an\nexpeditionary force north to help Arvedui (who had by then succeeded his\nfather) against Angmar; but that fleet arrived too late to save\nArthedain, instead providing the bulk of the forces that would smash\nAngmar at Fornost. In that encounter, Eärnur, Eärnil's son and eventual\nsuccessor, was personally humiliated by the Witch-king. When therefore\nthe Nazgûl had conquered Minas Ithil (TA 2002), and Eärnur succeeded his\nfather, the Witch-king, appealing to his pride, challenged him to single\ncombat; he rode to the gates of Minas Morgul (as Minas Ithil had been\nrenamed) with a small retinue and was never seen or heard from again.\n\nThus, within two generations of the Dúnedain, both Arnor and Gondor lost\ntheir kings. The northern Dúnedain were too weak to maintain a kingdom,\nand so their leaders, the successors of Isildur, took the humble title,\n“Chieftain of the Dúnedain”. In the south, by contrast, Gondor was still\na viable state, but the male-line descendants of Anárion were all but\nextinct. Unlike Rhudaur and Cardolan in the north, the Dúnedain of\nGondor refused to look for a king outside the royal family, so power was\nexercised in the name of the king by 26 successive Ruling Stewards, the\nfirst of whom was Mardil the Steadfast. By the time of the later\nStewards, Sauron's forces were constantly encroaching on Gondor's\nborders, and several more territories were ceded to allies or conquered\nby enemies: Calenardhon in the 26th century, and Ithilien, Gondor's sole\nremaining province east of the Anduin, in the 30th. In the War of the\nRing, Sauron sought to smash Gondor, his strongest opponent, but forces\nfrom Gondor and other nations beat his armies back in the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields. During that battle, Aragorn II, the Chieftain of the\nDúnedain of the North, and thus a descendant of both Isildur and\nAnárion, distinguished himself by arriving with a strong relief army at\nthe critical moment, and was acclaimed by the people of Gondor as King;\nhis only notable opponent within Gondor's ruling classes, Ruling Steward\nDenethor II, was driven mad and committed suicide on the day of the\nbattle. Thus, after Sauron was defeated by the destruction of his Ring,\nAragorn was crowned King of Gondor and received the sceptre of the Kings\nof Arnor, becoming the first King of the Reunited Kingdom."

This was to be\n    called Númenor, the Land in the West. The thread was to be the\n    occurrence time and again in human families (like Durin among the\n    Dwarves) of a father and son called by names that could be\n    interpreted as Bliss-friend and Elf-friend. ..... It started with a\n    father-son affinity between Edwin and Elwin of the present, and was\n    supposed to go back into legendary time by way of an Eädwine and\n    Ælfwine of circa A.D. 918, and Audoin and Alboin of Lombardic\n    legend, and so to the traditions of the North Sea concerning the\n    coming of corn and culture heroes, ancestors of kingly lines, in\n    boats (and their departure in funeral ships). .....

It was where Bilbo Baggins stole the One\nRing from Gollum. \n\nThe cave was located in the depths of the Misty Mountains near\nGoblin-town. It was close to the Great Goblin's cavern by following an\nestimated thirty miles of long, dark, and narrow tunnel.\n\nThe cave housed a small subterranean lake of ice cold water in which sat\na tiny island which supplied Gollum with a small amount of protection\nfrom the nearby Goblin Camp. This lake harboured a species of blind\nfish, Gollum's main food source throughout the years he spent there.\n\n\nGollum's history there\n\nAfter being exiled from his family of Stoors in the late twenty-third\ncentury of the Third Age, Gollum sought shelter from the Sun under the\nnearby mountain range, the Misty Mountains. Following the flow of an\nunderground stream, he made his way to a dark cave and made his home\nthere.  He soon found out that Goblins were living close by and used the\nnetwork of tunnels adjoining his. When he felt bold and hungry enough,\nGollum, using his magic ring to become invisible, throttled them and ate\nthem.\n\nIn TA 2941, Bilbo Baggins and his company of Dwarves were journeying\nthrough the Misty Mountains and were taken by surprise as a group of\ngoblins jumped upon them, causing a great mass of confusion amongst the\nDwarves. During their escape from Goblin-town, Bilbo would then have to\nfend for himself after falling and being missed in the darkness. He soon\nstumbled upon this cave after finding the One Ring and subsequently met\nGollum. Gollum, afraid of Bilbo's Elvish dagger, didn't attack as he\nnormally would have done. Instead, he spoke to Bilbo and ended up taking\npart in a game of riddles with the hobbit. If Gollum won, he would kill\nand eat Bilbo, and if Bilbo won, Gollum would show him the way out.\nAfter Gollum lost the riddle-game and discovered the loss of the Ring,\nhe became enraged and tried to kill Bilbo. However, Bilbo put on the\nRing and used it to follow Gollum to the exit of the cave.\n\nAfter Bilbo's escape with the Ring, Gollum remained in the cave for a\nlong time. However, he eventually left and wandered Middle-earth, trying\nto find Bilbo and reclaim his One Ring for himself once again."

It ran between Minas Tirith and the Fords\nof Isen in the Gap of Rohan, where it joined the North-South Road to\nArnor. The Great West Road was approximately 425 miles long.\n\nAt its far eastern end, the Great West Road met the North-way which came\nfrom Minas Tirith through Forannest, the North-gate of the Rammas Echor.\nThe Great West Road then curved around Amon Dîn and ran westward through\nAnorien. The Road skirted the edge of the Drúadan Forest and passed the\nBeacon-hills of Gondor at the foot of the White Mountains.\n\nThe Great West Road ran through the edge of the Firien wood to avoid the\nmarshy land north of the forest. A path marked by a standing stone\nbranched southward off the Road to Halifirien, the last of the\nBeacon-hills. At the western edge of the Firien Wood, the Great West\nRoad crossed a bridge over the Mering Stream, which was the border\nbetween Gondor and Rohan.\n\nIn Rohan, the Great West Road passed through the Fenmarch and the\nregions of the Eastfold and the Folde. The Road traversed the Snowbourn\nby way of a ford near Edoras, and a track branched off to the city.\nFurther on, the Deeping-road branched off into the Deeping Coomb where\nHelm's Deep was located.\n\nThe Great West Road then curved northwestward for a ways. About two\nmiles before the Fords of Isen there was a sharp westward turn and the\nRoad ran straight down to the riverbank. On the other side of the Isen,\nthe North-South Road began. A branch road led north to Isengard.\n\nIn the early days of Gondor, the Great West Road and the North-South\nRoad formed a single Royal Road between the two Kingdoms of the\nDunedain. At that time, the region between the Mering Stream and the\nFords of Isen was a province of Gondor called Calenardhon. In TA 2510,\nthat land became Rohan and the Rohirrim were responsible for maintaining\nthe stretch of the Great West Road that ran through their land.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, an army from Mordor crossed the Anduin into\nAnorien and blocked the Great West Road. They dug trenches and erected\nstakes in the roadway with the purpose of preventing the Rohirrim from\ncoming to Minas Tirith. But Ghan-buri-Ghan led the Rohirrim by a\nforgotten way through the Stonewain Valley and avoided the enemy forces.\nThe Rohirrim arrived at dawn on March 15, TA 3019, and helped win the\nBattle of the Pelennor Fields.\n\nNames and Etymology Also referred to as the '''West Road '''as well as\nthe HORSE-ROAD and the HORSE-MEN'S ROAD.\n\nThe North-South Road and the Great West Road were collectively called\nthe ROYAL ROAD or the GREAT ROAD.

    "title": "Common Beverages in Middle Earth",
    "page_id": "11674",
    "text": "COMMON BEVERAGES IN MIDDLE EARTH refers to what people generally prefer\nto drink on a regular basis.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThere are many types of drinks in Middle-earth. Some are preferred by\nMen, some by Hobbits, and still more by Dwarves, Elves, and Orcs. Let us\nstart with Men and Hobbits.\n\nMen, as well as Hobbits, are big Inn and Pub dwellers, and therefore\nlove a good drink. At the famous Prancing Pony Inn, located in Bree, a\nparticularly loved beverage is Barliman's Best, a very good ale served\nin pints, for Men are used to a beverage normally served in that\nquantity. However, Hobbits find it a rare treat to be served a pint, for\ntheir small body weight accounts for their limited serving size.\nTherefore, some travelling Hobbits that venture into Big Folk territory\nlove to order from any drink selection that comes their way. Other types\nof drinks that Men and Hobbits prefer that are not signature labeled\nlike Barliman's Best would include all types of beer and wine, and\nsometimes mead.\n\nAnother well known wine comes from the lake city of Lake-town, located\nsouth of Dale near the Lonely Mountain, east of Mirkwood. This city was\nfull of various merchants, and a prime trade was the selling of\nLake-town's fine wine, which was so good that even the Elves of Mirkwood\nput forth effort in obtaining it for their feasts and celebrations. This\nwine was floated back and forth in barrels between the Lake City and the\nElven kingdom in Mirkwood by use of a river for years.\n\nDwarves are especially fond of their drink, having been based on the\nNorse. To them, a day without a drink is a day not fully completed.\nDwarves prefer mead, but will just as soon accept any type of beer, just\nlike Men and Hobbits. Wine is not usually seen as a common Dwarf\nbeverage, for Dwarves are not depicted ever drinking it. However, based\non their common love for any alcoholic drink, one can assume that\nDwarves would not hesitate to drink a few goblets from this grape\nextract.\n\nElves are lovers of wine. As stated, the Elves of Mirkwood get all of\ntheir wine from the lake city of Lake-town, and there is never a\ndecrease in demand for it. Likewise, all other Elves of Middle-earth are\nnot easily parted from their various types of local wine. Travelers that\ncome upon their feasts will see that after the wine has been passed\naround for a while, a dramatic change in the general merry making\noccurs. When offered other types of alcoholic beverages, such as beer,\nElves are not known to decline, for they seem to accept all forms of\nalcohol. It is even said that an Elf could best a Dwarf in a drinking\ncontest, regardless of the type of drink.\n\nOrcs are only known to drink draught (or grog as it's commonly called),\nbut that's not to say that an orc isn't willing to consume whatever they\npillage. It's unknown what exactly draught is made of, but based on the\ntypical orc diet it can be suspected to have been brewed from flesh or\nblood, along with some sort of alcohol. Whatever it's made from, it's\ncertainly cause for the spectacular explosions that occur whenever\ndraught is ignited. It can also be described as being vile and\nfoul-smelling, but to an orc, anyone who hosts a feast without the drink\nwould be flogged until dead. In practical forms, draught is used as a\nliquid reserve for long trips in the stead of water and as a medicine.\nThe healing potency of draught is reflective of the orcs' ancestry with\nthe elves, able to scab over wounds within hours.\n"

It was mainly spoken in Valinor, but\nthe speakers of Telerin outnumbered in whole Aman the speakers of\nQuenya, much as did the Teleri outnumber the Vanyar and Noldor.\n\nSometimes Telerin was been considered a dialect of Quenya, but the\nTeleri themselves considered it to be an independent language. In the\nbroadest sense, _Telerin_ refers to any tongue of Elves that were of\nLindar origin.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of speakers of Quenya, Telerin was a closely related\nlanguage still largely intelligible. However, the phonology of the two\nlanguages differed much, with Telerin often being more conservative than\nQuenya.\n\nFinarfin is said to have learned Telerin. He also gave his sons\nTelerin-influenced Quenya names.\n\nThe coexistence with the Teleri, made the Noldor to differientate\nthemselves from the speech of the Vanyar. For example the Vanyar\npronounced /f/ very soft, almost like /hw/, but the Noldor resisted this\nchange through influence from the Teleri.\n\nAlso, the Teleri prized silver above gold, and their skill as\nsilversmiths was esteemed even by the Noldor who seemed to prefer the\nTelerin word _telpe_ “silver” intead the Quenya form _tyelpë_."

    "text": "The '''Kine of Araw '''were legendary cattle-like creatures that lived\naround the fertile plains of the Sea of Rhûn from the earliest days of\nArda onward.\n\n\nHistory\n\nAccording to the Encyclopedia of Arda, the Kine of Araw were descended\nfrom the even greater kine (cattle) of Orome the Hunter, who was known\nto be the master of beasts and birds. As Orome was chosen to lead the\nElves on the Great Journey, he might have intentionally (or\naccidentally) left his livestock in the East.\n\nThey presumably lived in the areas immediately adjacent to the Sea of\nHelcar, relocating to their present location around the Sea of Rhun when\nthat great ocean dried up.\n\nVorondil the Steward of Gondor ventured to the Far East and hunted one\nsuch beast, utilizing its great horns to craft the exquisite Horn of\nGondor. For the lengthy years afterward, it became an heirloom of\nGondor's stewards, handing it down to their oldest son for innumerable\ngenerations.\n\nHowever, its doom drew ever nearer, just as Sauron’s shadow returned\nfrom the depths of the East. During the War of the Ring it was carried\nby Boromir, son of Denethor. It was only when Boromir was assailed by\nhundreds of Uruk-hai, that the horn was eventually broken. The Uruk\nscimitars and broadswords clove the great horn in two, rendering it\nuseless. After being presented to his grieving (and insane) father, it\nwas buried with him.\n\n\nDescription\n\nAccording to Appendix A of the Lord of the Rings, the Kine of Araw were\nfar larger and splendid than common, earthly cattle (like Old Bessie).\nTheir hides were a gleaming pallid white that reflected the sun rising\nfrom the Gates of Morning in the East.\n\nThe horns attached to their gargantuan bodies were colossal in size,\ngiving the kine an air of grandeur. While nobody knows what the kine\nreally looked like, their size and scant description that we possess may\ngive them an appearance similar to the real-life Texas Longhorn.\n\nThere are certain parallels between the Kine and the real-world Aurochs.\nThe Aurochs is considered to be the ancestor of modern cattle; they were\nlarge, dangerous animals with great horns living across North Africa,\nEurope, and most of Asia. The Aurochs was driven to extinction in the\n1600s by heavy hunting, especially by royal families across Europe.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n'''Kine '''is a rather archaic English word, meaning “cattle.” As\nTolkien was deeply fluent in Old English, Welsh, and Scottish, he would\nhave used the term rather than a more modern one to better suit the\nmedieval feel of the _Lord of the Rings._\n\nLikewise, '''Araw '''is the Sindarin form of Oromë, which is a term from\nQuenya. The full term denotes and explains the beasts' heritage and\nhistory."

For Angmar, that most evil of realms in Eriador, was located\njust north of the North Downs, and many evil beings who were struggling\nto find a purpose in Angmar after the departure of the Witch-king\nfinally resolved to invade the lands south of them. Thus, the North\nDowns became a frontier against this new evil arisen in Angmar, a\nremnant of the old power of the Witch King called the Shadow of Angmar.\n\nThere was still hope though, in that harsh war zone, for the Free\nPeoples of Eriador waged constant war on the new servants of Angmar and\nthe Witch King.

The great island of Númenor itself\nwas destroyed and fell beneath the waves of the tumultuous sea, becoming\n“Atalantë” (The Downfallen). The land of Aman and the island of Tol\nEressëa were removed from the Circles of the World forever, and could be\nreached only by Elves sailing West out of Middle-earth, following the\nStraight Road.\n\nThe world from then on was round as the seas and the lands bent back\nupon themselves.

    "title": "Elven Weapons and Armour",
    "page_id": "12526",
    "text": "Elven Weapons\n\nThroughout their existence, Elves have been masters of making and using\nweapons and arms. Their skill at forging weapons and armor surpasses the\nrace of Men, but not the skill of the race of Dwarves. Tolkien writes:\n“In the tempering of steel alone of all crafts the Dwarves were never\noutmatched even by the Noldor, and in the making of mail  their\nwork had no rival.”\n\nEven more renowned is the Elven skill at using their fine weapons, be it\nbow or blade. The purpose of this article is to explain the type of\nweapons the Elves have used and what effect these weapons have had in\npast wars and battles. The article is not extensive, and covers only the\nmost basic of Elven weapons. \n\nSword\n\nThe Elven sword is used frequently by standard Elven warriors and it\ncomes in different forms. Apart from notable Elven blades such as\nAnglachel (wielded by Beleg Cúthalion and Turin Turambar, as well as\nbeing forged by Eol, the Dark Elf) , Glamdring (wielded by Gandalf), and\nOrcrist (used by Thorin Oakenshield), many more fierce swords have\nserved their handlers well in battle and have no title.\n\nA clue to what the earliest of the Elven blades were made of lies in a\ndescription of the first Orcs who attacked the Laegrim Elves in\nBeleriand. Apparently, these Orcs were equipped with steel weapons which\ngave them the edge over their Elven counterparts. Therefore, Elven\nweapons at that time were not in existence or were made of a weaker\nmaterial than steel. When the use of steel weaponry came upon the Elves\nin Valinor, most notably the Noldor, when Morgoth spoke to them\nconcerning weapons, a great change in the style of weaponmaking came\nabout, likely including the creation of the sword, due especially to\nsuperior Noldorin metallurgy.\n\n\n\nSting, the shortsword used by the Hobbits Bilbo and Frodo, is an example\nof Elven blades at their peak. Being able to glow blue when orcs and\ngoblins are near, Sting shows how Elven blades grew to have properties\nunknown to mortals. Even the black sword Anglachel is said to have\nspoken to Turin before it aided him in his suicide. Thus, Elven blades\nbecame renowned as great weapons, capable of performing deeds beyond the\nskill of their handlers and were even more glorious when the use of\nMithril was allowed to the Elves.\n\nBow\n\nElves mastered both the construction and uses of the bow, developing the\nstandard longbow and creating different variations of it. None were more\nskilled with the longbow than the Silvan Elves and most notable of those\nwere the Galadhrim, the wardens of Lothlórien, the Golden Wood. Some,\nwho became true masters of this weapon, were renown as skilled marksmen\nin several wars, the most famous being Legolas Greenleaf and Beleg\nCúthalion.\n\nElven arrows are not elaborately recorded and so the reader does not\nhave a wide variety of knowledge on the subject, though certain arrows\nwere dear to their owners, such as Dailir was to Beleg.\n\n\nElven Armour and Shields\n\nThe armour of the Elves has evolved throughout their days in Arda, but\nhas always been well made and of the highest quality, the only rival to\nit being Dwarf-made armor which is the finest to ever grace\nMiddle-Earth. Again, not much is said regarding Elven armor only that it\nis bright and beautiful to look upon. Much of Elven armour is derived\nfrom the early Dwarf designs, for the two races have great influence\nupon one another.\n\nThe earliest Elven armour was made by the Dwarves, and appears to have\nbeen scale armor, eventually superseded by mail of rings. Scale and\nchainmail were the armors used throughout the First Age, and appear to\nhave never been replaced. Thus, the armies of the Last Alliance likely\nwore the same mail worn by their ancestors millennia prior. Gil-galad\nhimself is said to have worn mail made of silver. Lastly, regarding\nSilvan Elves, the armor in which these forest dwellers were clad in\nconsisted mostly of leather and offered minimal protection,\n\nShields were also used by the Elves and highly decorated in Elf-fashion,\nlike their armour. The shields used by Elves appear to have been of much\nhigher-quality than the shields of Men--Tuor found himself a long kite\nshield, made of wood but plated with steel. Elves of high rank used\nshields decked with crystal."

    "page_id": "12543",
    "text": "History\n\nThroughout their existence, the so-called Naugrim, or Dwarves, have been\nexperts at making and using various weaponry, with no equal. This skill\ncomes from the Vala Aulë the Smith, who crafted the Dwarves at the\nbeginning of Arda. The list of common Dwarven weaponry goes on and on,\nand from their very origin each type, including bows, swords, axes, and\nmattocks, have retained a unique Dwarven identity and respect among\nother cultures.\n\n\nWeaponry\n\nAxe\n\n The Dwarven axe is the most famous and likely the most common weapon\nfor any Dwarf soldier. Used extensively throughout the wars fought by\nDwarves, the axe probably came into use by the time Khazad-dûm was\nfounded, somewhere in the Ages of Stars. The idea of the use of the axe\nis to drive forward while attacking; therefore, it is not good in\ndefense. Being a weapon that is hard to control, the axe takes great\nskill to master, which shows the skill and temperament the Dwarves have\nin warfare.\n\nSword\n\nThe Dwarven sword is less commonly wielded than the axe. Yet, certain\nfamous Dwarven figures have wielded this weapon to great effect. The\nwarriors of the Iron Hills carried a broad shortsword as a sidearm.\n\nMattock\n\nThe war-pick was the favored weapon of the Dwarves of the Iron Hills.\nTheir skill with them appears to have been well-known, for in most\ninstances where they are mentioned, their mattocks are named as well.\n\nBow\n\nThough not commonly associated with the Khazad, it appears bows were\nutilized by them as well. Thorin and company used bows given to them by\nBeorn in Mirkwood, and Thorin was the only dwarf of the company to hit\nthe stag they saw, implying skill with a bow. Thorin also scavenged a\nbow from the armories of Erebor, and used it to shoot at emissaries sent\nto negotiate with him.\n\n\nArmor\n\nPerhaps the Dwarves are best known for their armour above all other\nthings battle-related. Dwarf armor would be iron or steel chain-mail,\nwhich was invented and used by the Dwarves to great effect by the time\nof the Wars of Beleriand. Of course, iron or steel helms and shields\nwould accompany this chain-mail. Dwarven helmets are recorded to have\ncovered the face, with the use of a forged mask. This mask was\nparticularly helpful when fighting Dragons, as the face would be\nshielded from the flames, thanks to the expert craft of the Dwarves.\nLastly, with the use of Mithril, their armor changed more dramatically\nthan any other of their works did. Having such properties as to make\narrows bounce off, Mithril became an invaluable substance to the\nDwarves, so much, so that a single mail shirt could be “worth more than\nthe value of the Shire and everything in it”. However, the use of\nMithril in arms and armor became very limited after Orcs of the Misty\nMountains and the newly awakened Balrog of Morgoth overran the Dwarf\nmines of Khazad-dûm.\n\nDwarven shields are little-known, but the warriors of the Iron Hills\nwore a circular shield on their backs."

    "text": "The NORTH-SOUTH ROAD was part of the Royal Road linking Arnor and\nGondor. The North-South Road was approximately 600 miles long. It ran\nbetween Fornost in the north and Isengard in the south. At the Fords of\nIsen, the North-South Road merged with the Great West Road.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe northern half of the North-South Road was in Eriador. From Fornost,\nthe Road ran south to Bree. Outside the West-gate of Bree, the\nNorth-South Road intersected with the Great East Road. At this major\ncrossroads was the inn called The Prancing Pony, where travellers\nbrought news from the South as well as goods such as Pipe-weed, which\nfirst came to Bree and the Shire via the North-South Road.\n\nThe North-South Road then moved on through the narrow passage called the\nAndrath between the Barrow-downs and the South Downs. South of the\nAndrath, a road to the Shire branched off the North-South Road. The\nNorth-South Road then curved southeastward through the region of\nMinhiriath.\n\nAt the city of Tharbad, the Road crossed the River Greyflood on the\nsouthern border of Eriador. Originally, the Road went over the Bridge of\nTharbad. On either side of the Bridge, the Road was built up on\ncauseways to traverse the surrounding marshland. However, the Bridge was\ndestroyed by floods in TA 2912 and all that remained was a dangerous\nford.\n\nThe southern half of the North-South Road passed through Enedwaith,\nwhich at one time nominally belonged to Gondor but was essentially a\nborderland between Gondor and Arnor. East of the Road in Enedwaith was\nDunland at the foot of the Misty Mountains.\n\nAt the southern end of the Misty Mountains, the North-South Road curved\neastward through the Gap of Rohan and ended at the Fords of Isen. Just\nwest of the Fords a road branched north to Isengard. East of the Fords\nwas the Great West Road to Minas Tirith and Osgiliath.\n\nTogether the North-South Road and the Great West Road formed the Royal\nRoad, or Great Road, which was the main route by land between Gondor and\nArnor. The two Kingdoms were founded in 3320 of the Second Age. Each was\nresponsible for maintaining their own stretch of the Road, and together\nthey built and maintained the Bridge of Tharbad and its causeways.\n\nAfter the Great Plague of TA 1636, Gondor and Arnor were considerably\nweakened and could no longer keep the Road and Bridge in repair. The\nNorth-kingdom fell in TA 1974 and Fornost at the northern end of the\nNorth-South Road was abandoned. The causeways near Tharbad eventually\ndisintegrated and the marshes encroached on the Road. In the spring of\nTA 2912 after the Fell Winter, floods caused the Bridge to collapse.\n\nFewer and fewer travellers used the North-South Road and it became\novergrown with grass, so that the people of Bree called it the Greenway.\nHowever, during the War of the Ring at the end of the Third Age,\nunwelcome travellers began to come up the North-South Road from the\nSouth. Some were honest refugees, but many were troublemakers, including\nagents of Saruman. Early in 3019, there was fighting in Bree, and the\nShire was taken over by Saruman's agents.\n\nThe Hobbits expelled the Men from the Shire in the Battle of Bywater on\nNovember 3, and the Rangers of the North returned from the war and dealt\nwith the other troublemakers. The North-kingdom was reestablished by\nAragorn, King Elessar, and the North-South Road was open to travellers\nonce more.\n\n\nNames & Etymology\n\nThe NORTH-SOUTH ROAD was called the GREENWAY in later years by the\nBree-folk because it had become disused and overgrown with grass. It was\nsometimes called the NORTH ROAD and the OLD SOUTH ROAD.\n\nThe North-South Road and the Great West Road were collectively called\nthe ROYAL ROAD or the GREAT ROAD. (Note that the Great East Road was\nalso referred to as the Great Road.)"

Men were\nbeginning to increase in the lands near them and with Sauron occupying\nDol Guldur, the long and peaceful forest of Greenwood the Great was\nbecoming evil.

Breeland was their home\nfor over three-hundred years until TA 1601, when King Argeleb II of\nArthedain granted them the land between the Far Downs and the Brandywine\nRiver.

    "text": "The AGES OF THE CHILDREN OF ILÚVATAR chronicle major events in the\nhistory of the Eruhíni.\n\nThe First Age of the Children of Ilúvatar began during the Years of the\nTrees when the Elves awoke at Cuiviénen. This marked the start of the\nyears when the Children of Ilúvatar were active in Middle-earth. Later\nin the First Age the second kindred, humans, and Ilúvatar's adopted\nchildren, the Dwarves, also awoke.\n\nTolkien wrote that the later Ages lasted about 3,000 years, though this\nduration was not fixed and he felt that the Ages 'sped up' over time.\nEach ended following the completion of some major event in the history\nof the Children of Ilúvatar.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn some texts Tolkien referred to the 'First Age of Middle-earth' or the\n'First Age of the World' rather than the 'First Age of the Children of\nIlúvatar'. These variations had earlier starting points, extending the\nFirst Age back to the creation of Arda, but consistently ended with\nMorgoth's defeat in Beleriand.\n\nThe terms 'First Age of the Sun' and 'Ages of the Sun' are commonly used\nby many fans, but do not appear anywhere in Tolkien's writings. The\n'First Age of the Sun' in this conception is held to begin with the\nfirst rising of the Sun and continue until Morgoth's defeat nearly 600\nyears later. While this is at odds with Tolkien's statements that the\nFirst Age was the longest by far it is a common misapprehension because\nthe subsequent ages all took place entirely during the Years of the Sun.\n\nThe time of Arda is typically rendered in Ages. Ages are one epoch of\nthe Valar. Before the arising of the Sun they were approximately one\nthousand Valian Years in length (the exact length of a Valian Year\nvaried in different drafts of Tolkien's texts from close to 10\n“Sun”-years in most versions to precisely 144 “Sun”-years in his final\nestimation). After the Sun Ages “sped up”, and length is more variable.\nThe Years of the Sun began with the 30th Valian Age, and the Fourth Age\nof Middle-earth began with the 37th Valian Age. However, only four, not\nseven Ages are counted. The Second and later Ages, during the Years of\nthe Sun, correspond more to the earlier Valarian Eras than to their\nAges.\n\n\nBrief Timeline\n\n    _For a much more detailed description of Timeline see: Timeline of\n    Arda_\n\n-   Before the Ainur were made.

    "page_id": "13461",
    "text": "The Silvan sentinels were the guardians of the woodland realms of the\nElves in Middle-earth.\n\n\nOrigin\n\nThe Silvan archers reached their peak after the fall of Morgoth, at the\nstart of the Second Age of the Sun. This was a period after Beleriand\nhad fallen into ruin and many Elven lords, both Ñoldor and Sindar, began\nto expand into the rest of Middle-earth, setting up fiefs and kingdoms\nin places such as Eregion, Lórien and Greenwood the Great. The latter\ntwo were at this time inhabited by those Avari, or “unwilling” Elves who\nwould not take the journey to Valinor. These were the great days, when\nthe Sindar lords came upon the Avari or Silvan Elves and were taken in\nas kings, great lords who knew and taught much knowledge and crafts to\nthe Silvan Elves. At that time the dark forest of Mirkwood was not in\nexistence, but was rather known as Greenwood the Great, a huge and lush\nforest inhabited by many fair creatures, whose beauty and richness was\nlike that of Doriath in Beleriand. So similar it was to Doriath like the\nSindar immediately settled there and were warmly welcomed by the Silvan\nElves. Through knowledge of the Sindar craft, the Silvan Elves were able\nto hone their skills with the bow and become master archers, now\noutfitted with new, shining weaponry and gear that only the Eldar could\nmake. But as for their own woodcraft, none could surpass the Silvan\nElves, who were already masters of the forest, able to hide in the\nshadows and remain undetected. Indeed, the “Silvan Shadow” was a trait\nnot even the Sindar could master. Thus the true Sentinel of the Forest\nwas born.\n\n\nGear\n\nThe weapons of the sentinel are few, easy to carry but extremely deadly.\nA standard warden would have a longbow, usually made of mallorn wood, an\nElven dagger, knife or handaxe and a quiver full of arrows, sometimes\ntipped with poison or barbed. A wealthier archer would probably have a\nshortsword as well, of Elven make of course. The armour of the Silvan\nsentinel is light as well, easily able to blend in with its\nsurroundings, whatever they may be. Indeed, the famous Lorien cloaks\nperform just this task. Apart from a cloak or mantle, the archer has a\nleather shirt, leggings, greaves, gauntlets, etc. He is very lightly\narmoured, for he is not expected to be heard by his enemy by the\njostling of mail or be forced into a prolonged fight. However a richer,\nmore elite archer may wear partial chainmail (always Elven made).\n\n\nEffectiveness ﻿\n\nA sentinel is quite deadly, provided he is well armed and he is covered\nby a woodland surrounding. His aim is not to hit and run, but rather to\nwipe out any foul and evil creature seen lurking in his zone of patrol,\nwithout being seen. During the War of the Ring, the sentinels were hard\nput to defending their borders, for the shadow of Dol Guldur had\nlaunched reparative raids on both woodland realms, ultimately\nculminating in the Battle Under the Trees, when the sentinel's finest\nhour had arrived. During the battle, the forces of Dol Guldur were\nbeaten back from Lórien and Thranduil's Halls and eventually the Hill of\nSorcery itself was laid bare by the White Lady of Lórien herself,\nGaladriel. This proves that the Silvan sentinel's effectiveness goes far\nand beyond that of any other woodsman in Middle-earth.\n\n\nDecline of the Sentinel\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, Mirkwood was made fair again but the time of\nthe Sindar had ended in Middle-earth. Thus, the Silvan Elves, who were\nof the Avari, remained in their dwindling kingdoms, but eventually their\npeople dwindled as well, so much so that they became only a memory, a\nlegend of elder days. The World has changed, Arda has been reshaped, but\nin the few forests that still exist on this earth, an ancient spirit or\ntwo of the Avari wardens may continue to dwell that has yet to see the\nfinal chapter of its history.\n\n\nSources\n\n-   The Fellowship of the Ring, Ch. VI (Book II), p. 347, Lothlórien\n-   The Hobbit, Ch.

A\nmember of the Éoherë can serve a term or on a permanent basis.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the first three hundred-plus years of Rohan's existence, the term\n“Éored” was used widely to describe any significant number of Riders.\nUnder Folcwine King son of Folca, fourteenth King of the Mark, the\nmilitary of Rohan was reordered. Under Folcwine, one Éored was made up\nof 120 riders including their captain. Each Éored was also supposed to\ncomprise one one-hundredth of the whole Muster of Rohan, not including\nthe household of the King.\n\nAn Éored was a group of trained warriors who rode as a unit. Under the\nmilitary reorganization in the time of King Folcwine, the size of a full\nÉored was determined to be at least 120 men. One Éored was one hundredth\nof the Éoherë - the full muster of Rohan. The Riders of an Éored could\nserve for a term or on a permanent basis. A Captain led each Éored. In\ntimes of war or unrest, the Marshals of the Mark each had a battle-ready\nÉored as part of his household, which he could command at his\ndiscretion.\n\nThe changes made by Folcwine lasted through the time of the War of the\nRing. While the Éoherë commanded by Théoden King son of Thengel at the\nBattle of the Pelennor Fields did not number much more than half of the\n12,000 riders supossed to be a full muster of Rohan, it was possibly the\nlargest riding of the Rohirrim in history. Éowyn (disguised as a Rider\nnamed Dernhelm) and Merry Brandybuck rode with the Éored commanded by\nElfhelm to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields on March 15. When the\nRohirrim charged onto the battlefield, Éomer led the first Éored in the\ncenter while Elfhelm's Éored was on the right flank and Grimbold's was\non the left flank and the other companies followed behind. King Théoden\nrode before them all.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word ÉOHERË comes from the Anglo-Saxon Old English (which the tongue\nof Rohan was modelled after); it is made up of the words EOH meaning\n“horse” and HERË meaning “army.” Likewise Éored contains the words 'eoh'\nand 'rád' (horse, riding or rode).\n\npl:Éoherë"

It was taken by the Orcs of Cirith Ungol from\nFrodo, but was later with the Mouth of Sauron, as he showed it to\nGandalf, Aragorn, and the other leaders outside the Morannon in the\nBattle of the Black Gate. It was later returned to Frodo.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe origins of the shirt are largely unknown, though it was said to have\nbeen made for a young Elf prince long ago. It eventually came to be part\nof the Dwarven treasure hoard of the Lonely Mountain. It was found by\nthe dragon Smaug and added to his treasure heap. Here, it was given by\nThorin II Oakenshield to the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, who wore it during\nthe Battle of Five Armies. After returning to the Shire, Bilbo loaned\nthe shirt to the Mathom-house. Before departing the Shire for Rivendell,\nBilbo reclaimed the shirt and wore it on that journey.\n\nMany years later it was given by Bilbo to his nephew Frodo Baggins as\nFrodo set out on his quest to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Frodo\nwore the chain shirt under his tunic unknown to the rest of the\nFellowship. It was discovered when, during a skirmish in the mines of\nMoria, an Orc chieftain stabbed Frodo with a spear. The shirt\nprevented what would have been a lethal wound, leaving Frodo badly\nbruised but otherwise uninjured.\n\nThe shirt was confiscated from Frodo in the Tower of Cirith Ungol. The\ntwo squadrons of orcs that captured Frodo fought over the valuable\nshirt, and most were killed during the conflict. One of the two Orc\nleaders, Shagrat, survived the fight and seized the shirt, escaping the\ntower with it. The shirt eventually ended up in the possession of the\nMouth of Sauron at Barad-dûr, where he presented it to Gandalf at the\nBlack Gates as false evidence that Frodo had failed in his quest. In his\nwrath Gandalf retrieved the shirt. The wizard later returned it to Frodo\nafter the destruction of the Ring.\n\nit:Cotta di Mithril"

They were made around the same\ntime as the Rings of Power and there were, presumably, many of them\nsince “In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made” and there are\nonly twenty Rings of Power, unless twenty is considered “many” rings.\nGandalf states that though the Elves who forged them thought little of\nthem, he still thinks they are dangerous for mortals.\n\nThey are lesser rings of the Rings of Power, forged by the Elves as\n“essays in the craft”- they bore no gem (similar to the One Ring).\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the ancient days of the Second Age, before the Fall of Númenor, many\nrings were forged, the craft being taught by Sauron. These rings aided\nin the use of spells and magical craft, and thus were widely popular\nwith the Elves. Sauron, then known as “Lord of the Gifts” claimed he\nwished to make Middle-earth as fair as Valinor, and it seemed he\nconvinced the elves to think these rings could do so.\n\nAfter the forging of the One Ring, Sauron began drawing these lesser\nrings to himself. This was not difficult, for the One Ring gave him the\nstrength to subdue the wielders of these powerful artifacts. Once\ngathered, Sauron could disperse them among his captains, making them all\nmighty champions whom he could back up at will with his own strength via\nthe magic ring connection. After the Last Alliance of Elves and Men and\nthe First Fall of Sauron, these rings were dispersed through the land.\nSome were taken from dead warriors, others, borne away by the\nfrightened, still living servants of Sauron, others were lost and little\nis known of what happened to them until the War of the Ring.\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring, Sauron gathered again the lesser\nrings to himself. But this time, he kept a great deal of them so as to\nadvance his own abilities. Though not stated in the books or movies, it\nseems reasonable to believe that some were given again to his commanders\nas well, and logically some were lost or destroyed before they could be\nreclaimed. \n\nTheir ultimate fates are unknown, nor is it known whether or not their\npowers were bound to the power of the One Ring. If they were, then their\npower would have failed with the destruction of the One.\n\n\nPowers\n\nThe full extent of the rings' power is unknown, but Gandalf says that\n“none are to be used lightly”. They were, to an extent, like the One\nRing when it came to temptation. They would give a being strength,\nmagical ability, and the power to dominate other wills.\n\nIt is also believed (though again, not stated) that these rings also had\ncertain fields in which they were strongest. For example, one ring may\nrule over stone, while another controls ice. This, however, is not known\nfact, and only stems from what is known about the Rings of Power,\nassuming that the lesser rings are much like them."

One of his subjects, Nuin Father of\nSpeech, came to a hidden valley of great loveliness and found there\nsleeping figures young but not children, boys and girls: the Fathers of\nMen. He told this to Tu, who fell into great fear of the One, and told\nNuin that these were the Fathers of Men, who were to be undisturbed.\nNotes then tell that Nuin awoke two of the Sleepers, Ermon and Elmir,\nand taught them speech; that Tu and Nuin shepherded the Sleepers when\nthey awoke with the Sun, and that Men split into factions in the years\nafterward. Tu grew to shun day and took to dwelling underground. A demon\nnamed Fankil, son of Melkor, arose and set Men at each other's throats,\nand especially against the Elves.

When his\nthoughts turned to Rohan, it became apparent that however heavy the\ninfantry were, there was no standing against the legendary cavalry of\nthe Rohirrim. So were born the Uruk-hai Pikemen, for the best thing\nagainst a horse powered charge, is a long, sharp stick.\n\n\nBattle of Helms Deep\n\n\n\nDuring the Battle of Helms Deep most of the Uruk-hai Pikemen present\nwere unable to take an active part in the fighting until the Deepening\nWall was breached and the main gate had been battered down. Once the\nwall was breached the Pikemen were among the first units to become\ninvolved in hand to hand fighting taking a charge from Aragorn and the\nGaladrim elves, skewering many of them in their initial charge. The\nPikemen along with the rest of the Uruk-hai then pushed the remaining\ndefenders toward the keep. \n\n\n\nWhen Lord Eomer's forces arrived the next day to relieve the defenders\nthey were met with a bristling wall of pikes, that was fortunately\nbroken by the sun rising over the hill.\n\nWhat remained of the Uruk-hai was killed by Huorns as they attempted to\nretreat back to Isengard."

It\nresulted in Frodo getting stabbed by a Morgul-blade and only minor\ninjuries to the Nazgûl.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nAfter Bilbo Baggins' 111th birthday party, the One Ring was passed onto\nhis nephew, Frodo Baggins. After Gandalf returned from Gollum's\ninterrogation, he ordered Frodo and Samwise Gamgee to flee from The\nShire and meet him at The Prancing Pony in Bree. Upon leaving, Frodo and\nSam met with Merry and Pippin, who decided to join them in their quest\nto Bree.\n\nStrider and Making Way to Weathertop\n\nThe Hobbits reached The Prancing Pony and Gandalf was nowhere to be\nseen. After Frodo accidentally placed on the One Ring, Aragorn,\ndisguised as a man named Strider, pulled Frodo to another section of The\nPrancing Pony to tell him that their journey is not over and they must\njourney to Rivendell where the ring will be in safer hands.\n\nThe group stopped at Weathertop as night was coming. As Aragorn left to\ngather more supplies and look out for intruders, the Nazgûl found the\nHobbits and chased them to the top of Weathertop where the battle was to\nbegin.\n\n\nThe Battle\n\n\n\nThe Hobbits attacked the Nazgûl as the battle began. Due to their\ninexperience with Swords and combat, the Hobbits were no match against\nthe Nazgûl and were defeated with minor wounds. The Witch-king of Angmar\nthen realized that Frodo had the One Ring and approached him during the\nbattle.\n\nAragorn arrived before more damage could be done onto the Hobbits. He\nfought against the Nazgûl and was able to drive most of them away.\nHowever, noticing the Witch-King approaching, Frodo put on the One Ring\nin attempt to hide from the Witch-King. That proved to have no effect\nwhen the Witch-king saw him in the wraith-world, and stabbed his\nshoulder with a Morgul-blade.\n\nFrodo fainted, but took off the Ring before losing consciousness\ncompletely. Aragorn was able to drive the rest of the Nazgûl off, but\nFrodo had sustained a wound that would haunt him in the years after.\n\nThe Nazgûl escaped but Frodo was left poisoned by the Witch-king's\ndagger and required healing from the Elves."

    "text": "History\n\nBackground\n\nIn the ages prior to the sun, Arda was reformed by the massive energy\nreleased when Melkor destroyed the original light sources, the two\nLamps. The Valar fled the razing to the newly formed continent of Aman\nand built Valinor, while Melkor reigned unchecked in the new continent\nof Middle-earth, where he corrupted the surviving beasts. Unaware of\nthese designs, the Valar did not approach him for fear that the\nconfrontation would be just as world-devastating as the extinguishment\nof the light. Their priority was to protect the original plan of\ncreation, though they were unsure of what was salvageable. They did not\nknow if Eru's personal creations, elves and men, would now ever come\ninto being after the catastrophe.\n\nFortunately, the elves did come to being; however, they appeared in\nMiddle-earth near Cuiviénen. Withdrawn, the Valar were unaware of this.\nOn the other hand, Melkor was quickly learned of this through his spies.\nSoon, elves who wandered too far from their lands were captured and\ntaken to the fortresses of Angband and Utumno. There, in Melkor's utmost\ncontempt for Eru and his sole ability to create life, they were\ncorrupted through torture into servants bred solely for war - orcs.\n\nSometime later, while on a hunting trip in Middle-earth, the Valar Oromë\nstumbled upon the elves that were unharmed. After realizing what they\nwere, he asked them to return with him to Valinor for their protection.\nWhile the majority of them agreed, a some refused, believing him to be\ntheir kidnapper. When Oromë returned with the elves willing to leave\nwith him, the Valar were made aware of orcs. Their creation was\nmost-likely seen as the worst imaginable offense. Manwë and the rest of\nthe Valar could stand this no longer, and so the Valar took counsel with\neach other and decided to rid Middle-earth of Melkor's tyranny.\n\nThe War\n\nSoon, the Valar declared war on Melkor, presumably a massive army of\nlight and battled him for many decades. The Host of the Valar easily\ndefeated Melkor's host at the Battle of the Powers in northwestern\nMiddle-earth. The remnant of his forces fled back to Utumno and\nfortified themselves there. The Valar passed over Middle-earth and\nplaced a guard over Cuiviénen to protect the elves from any further\neffects of the war or perhaps from an attack from Melkor's servants.\nThen, the Host of the Valar went north to Utumno and besieged it. After\ndecades of siege, the Host of the Valar finally broke through and after\nTulkas himself personally defeated Melkor in combat, they captured him\nand took him to Valinor for judgment, and sentenced him to prison in the\nHalls of Mandos for thousands of years.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe war between the two powers devastated the lands of Middle-earth and\nthe face of the continent was changed. The distance between Middle-earth\nand Aman separated by the Great Sea became wider. A Gulf in south was\ncreated and small bays appeared between the Great Gulf and Helcaraxë.\nThe Mountains of Hithlum and the highlands of the Dorthonion were\ncreated. The Sirion river that flowed into the newly formed Bay of Balar\nappeared. Free of evil, the elves were invited to Valinor and undertook\na Great Journey across Middle-earth in which new Elven cultures were\ndeveloped. The result was the peopling and colonisation of the western\nparts of Middle-earth with the Children of Ilúvatar.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe main legacy of war was that it allowed the Elves to go to Aman and\nValinor where they became High Elves, enlightened, cultured, and\nskilled. Elves in Middle-earth established themselves learning much of\nnature, woodlore, and shipbuilding. However, the fear brought about by\nMelkor caused some elves to relent and stay in the east longer. These\nelves, the Avari and the rest of the Dark Elves developed separate and\nmore secretive cultures and stayed away from the affairs of their long\nloss brethren for the most part. They would then thousands and thousands\nof years later in the Third and Fourth Ages become the Wood-elves that\nwould be the last of the kindreds of left in Middle-earth ever after.\nThe languages of the elves spread throughout Middle-earth and blended\nand influenced other tongues and became known of ever after.\n\nThe other legacy was that Melkor, then released from prison who would\never after remember that his downfall was because of the Elves sought\nrevenge thus causing the Revolt of the Ñoldor and the War of the Jewels\nand the battles and dramas that followed. It would also serve to\nshape the course of the history of the Children of Ilúvatar for ages to\ncome."

Tolkien participated in the battle and witnessed\nfirsthand the carnage, suffering, and terrible losses of life. The\nresult was that it was to have a profound effect on Tolkien's works,\nmost notably _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\nTolkien's good friends Robert Gilson and Geoffrey Bache Smith were\nkilled in the battle.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe battle started on the 1 July 1916 after a heavy artillery\nbombardment on the German lines that had begun a week before on 24 June\n1916. The battle was intended to be a decisive breakthrough for the\nallies against the Central Powers, but it did not turn out that way. The\nbattle ended on the 18 November 1916. In the space of just over four\nmonths, the battle produced over one million casualties and was\nindecisive and although the allies gained ground (only five miles total)\nthey did not break through the German lines and win the war.\n\nThe battle was fought on the Western Front in the north-central Somme\nand southeastern Pas-de-Calais Départements, of France.\n\nTolkien's role\n\nTolkien's involvement in the battle lasted from July to October 1916\nduring which he served as a Battalion Signalling Officer to the 11th\nBattalion of The Lancashire Fusiliers. His unit operated mainly in the\nnorthern section of the Somme and was stationed in the Beaumont-Hamel,\nSerre, and Leipzig salient trenches. He was in the Battle of Thiepval\nRidge and helped captured the Regina Trench from the Germans for a time.\nThe filthy and wretched conditions of the trenches and areas of battle\nalong with stress caused Tolkien to come down with Trench fever and\nTrench foot, which put him out of the war permanently.\n\n\nAftermath and Effects on Writing\n\nWhile in hospital recovering from his diseases of war, Tolkien did much\nwriting where his experiences in the battle were where many of the ideas\nfor the terrible battles of the War of the Ring and the epic Fall of\nGondolin, which were outlined in _The Lord of the Rings_ and the _Book\nof Lost Tales_. Another theme which grew out of Tolkien's participation\nin the battle was the struggles of ordinary peoples in extraordinary\nsituations and that the smallest of people can make big contributions\nand differences. Possibly, Tolkien was inspired by the great potential,\nbravery, and hardiness he saw in the ordinary low-ranked citizen\nsoldiers that fought in the battle."

    "text": "The RE-COLONIZATION OF MORIA was an attempt by Balin to rebuild the\nancient Dwarven Kingdom of Moria in TA 2989 to TA 2994. Under the\nleadership of Balin, the initial effort was successful, and for a while,\nthe Dwarves reclaimed some of Moria. However, the tide turned in favor\nof the goblins when the Balrog known as Durin's Bane emerged and led a\nmassive army of goblins in a counter-attack. No dwarf of the colony\nsurvived.\n\n\nHistory\n\n48 years after the Battle of the Five Armies, Balin along with Flói,\nÓin, Ori, Frár, Lóni, Náli, and a large colony of Dwarves marched from\nthe Lonely Mountain to Moria to reclaim the dwarven city with the\nunwilling leave of Dain II Ironfoot as he feared what was there. He\nhoped to reclaim some of the lost treasures of the lost realm like the\nRing of Thrór. The initial battles took place from the Dimrill Dale to\nthe Chamber of Mazarbul in which Flói was killed before they reached the\nFirst Hall. Nevertheless everything went well as the Dwarves proved to\nbe fiercely determined to take back their home, slaying every goblin in\ntheir path, eventually some of Moria was reclaimed and they dwelt in the\nTwenty-first Hall until Balin moved to the Chamber of Mazarbul which\nthen become his seat of government from then on. For the next few years,\nBalin ruled as Lord of Moria. The goblins became a mere nuisance during\nthose years and were not serious threats. Here, Balin and company found\nDurin's Axe and some sort of 'helm'.\n\nLittle did the Dwarves know, that Moria was ruled by a Balrog, a demon\nof the Eldar Days that survived in the deeps for many thousands of years\nthat the Dwarves were no match for. By the year TA 2994, Durin's Bane\nand a horde of goblins launched a massive counterattack from the east.\nBalin was shot by an archer and died in Dimrill Dale and many other\nDwarves perished as well and retreated into the mines. Bloody fighting\ntook place all over Moria, but the strength of the Dwarves were\nultimately no match for the sheer number of goblins and the power of the\nBalrog. Soon the Bridge of Khazad-dum and the Second Hall were taken by\nthe goblins. Frár and Lóni and Náli were among the casualties the\nDwarves lost in the second hall. Oin and a group of Dwarves tried to\nescape through the Doors of Durin but were killed by the Watcher in the\nWater. The last Dwarves barred the doors of the Chamber of Mazarbul and\nwere able to built a tomb for Balin. Eventually, the goblins broke\nthrough and slew the remaining Dwarves ending the peaceful\nre-colonization of Moria.\n\n\nAftermath\n\nWith the Dwarven colony destroyed, Moria continued to be a place of evil\nthat none dared enter until the Fellowship of the Ring learned of it\nwhen they passed through it, slaying Durin's Bane in the process.\n"

During this\ntime, Olwë established many realms and moved his people to Alqualondë.\nOlwë married an unnamed elf, possibly of Telerin origin like himself,\nand had several sons and a daughter called Eärwen.

Through Angrod, his son\nOrodreth and Orodreth's children Finduilas and Gil-galad were members of\nthis house.
