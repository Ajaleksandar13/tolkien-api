    "text": "These Were giant armored war beasts (most likely Mountain Trolls) that\nparticipated in the Battle of the Five Armies, in The Hobbit: The Battle\nof the Five Armies.\n\n\nStatistics\n\nThese trolls were very large, dwarfing all the others seen previously,\n(about 25 feet tall or more) more importantly they were either fully or\npartially armored, unlike the smaller yet extremely similar Guldur\nOlog-Hai, which were fully armored but as stated above much smaller\n(about the size of a regular troll in the films) These trolls were\nfearsome weapons on the field and devastated dozens of soldiers with one\nstrike alone of their weapons.\n\nThese trolls were quite intelligent and kept formation with the orcs as\nthey marched to battle, in battle these trolls carried bladed axe/sword\nlike weapons upon their arms, (similar to the Guldur Orcs's shields)\nlong metal maces which could smash the very earth several feet into the\nair, taking down several men at once. Some even used their bare hands,\nballing them up into fists to smash the allied armies, or sweeping them\nup and throwing them like rag-dolls.\n\nThe less fortunate of these trolls were also hideously amputated by the\norcs, giving them morning star (wrecking ball-like) arms in place of\ntheir flesh and blood ones, some had metal hooks placed into their backs\nfor goblins to take hold of, and the most unfortunate was blinded and\ngiven reigns dangling from their eye sockets for orcs to directly take\ncontrol of.\n\nThese trolls were probably Mountain Trolls from Gundabad in the northern\nmisty mountains, this would explain their height, and color of their\nskin (being a peach like hue) instead of the darker blue cave troll skin\nor dark grey olog-hai skin.\n\nUnlike the smaller Guldur Olog's these trolls couldn't simply be taken\ndown by a spear throw to the neck or a few arrows. It would take dozens\nof arrows and several spears/pikes to be sent into the unarmored parts\nof the trolls in order to take them down. A premeditated attack upon a\ntroll would usually work and need to be planned out well in order to\ntake out the beast before it took down a whole garrison.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThese trolls were used primarily in Azog the Defiler's Dol-Guldur orc\narmy, directed to come out as soon as Azog called for the war beasts,\nalmost immediately these trolls smashed into the allied army, causing\nmassive damage, when some of the orc regiments made their way to the\nruins of dale, some of these trolls joined them, climbing over the walls\nor simply smashing them down to gain access. One of these trolls was\neven given a stone headpiece to act as a battering ram to the walls of\ndale. Most of these trolls survived until the end of the battle, still\nfighting on when the bats of gundabad arrived. But once the Eagles\narrived, the remaining trolls either fled into the Were -Worm tunnels,\nor were eventually taken down by the combined allied forces."

    "text": "The UNDYING LANDS were a realm inhabited by Ainur and Eldar. The area\nincluded the continent of Aman and the island of Tol Eressëa. The ocean\nBelegaer separated the Undying Lands from the western shores of\nMiddle-earth. Only immortals and ring-bearers were allowed to live in\nthis realm.\n\n\nHistory\n\nEldar Days and Second Age\n\nOriginally, mortals were allowed to trade with those from Valinor in the\nUndying Lands, but were forbidden to sail west beyond the sight of\nNúmenor. However, in SA 3319 (Second Age), Sauron deceived Ar-Pharazôn,\nthe King of Númenor, that the ruler of the Undying Lands would be\ngranted immortality. To prevent the king's invasion, Ilúvatar destroyed\nNúmenor beneath the ocean and set the Undying Lands forever beyond the\nreach of mortal Men. Elves were still permitted to sail across the sea\nto the Undying Lands, if they chose to (which most did).\n\nThird Age\n\nIn TA 3021 (Third Age), Círdan the Shipwright accompanied Elrond,\nGaladriel, and Gandalf, the Keepers of the Rings, on a voyage to the\nUndying Lands, where they intended to remain. They were also joined by\nFrodo and Bilbo Baggins, Hobbits who were among the very few mortal\nbeings to be allowed passage to the Undying Lands.\n\nFourth Age\n\nEventually, Samwise Gamgee, another Hobbit of the Shire, and the Dwarf\nGimli along with his great friend Legolas made the journey to the\nUndying Lands. It is unknown how Manwë took to Gimli’s arrival, as he\nwould have killed Earendil for coming to Valinor uninvited and only\nspared him because he came on behalf of Elves and Men."

    "text": "The FIRST AGE began with the completion of Valinor, and ended with the\noverthrow of Morgoth. The First Age was also known as the ELDER DAYS.\n\nIt lasted about 3,000 Valian years, and each Valian year is the\nequivalent of 10 solar years.(making it the longest of the three Ages\ndescribed by Tolkien), and ended with the final overthrow of Morgoth by\nthe combined armies of Valinor and Beleriand.\n\n\n\nTolkien describes primarily the events that occurred in Beleriand. These\nwere centered on a series of wars waged by the Sindar, the Ñoldor and\nthe Three Houses of the Edain, against the power of Morgoth. The wars\nhad actually begun during the Years of the Trees, but began again with\nrenewed fury after the arrival of the Ñoldor in Beleriand. There had\nbeen Elves in Beleriand for uncounted millennia, but they sought merely\nto exist, and Morgoth had little to do with them. The Ñoldor, on the\nother hand, particularly the Sons of Fëanor, had come with the express\npurpose of defeating Morgoth.\n\nChief Battles of this Age\n\n-   The Dagor-nuin-Giliath, so named because it was fought before the\n    rising of the Sun) was fought soon after the arrival of the Ñoldor.\n    Morgoth sent a raiding party from Angband to attack the Ñoldor\n    encampment in Hithlum, but the elves drove it back. Fëanor was\n    killed. It is considered the second battle in the Wars of Beleriand,\n    after one that took place during the Years of the Trees.\n\n\n\n-   The Dagor Aglareb was fought about seventy-five years after the\n    return of the Ñoldor. Morgoth again attacked the Ñoldor, and (again)\n    with no success. The Ñoldor became so bold as to besiege Angband.\n    However, the Siege was of limited effectiveness, because the\n    northern side of Angband on the north side of the Ered Engrin, and\n    was unapproachable to the Elven forces.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The Dagor Bragollach began when Morgoth poured rivers of fire out of\n    Angband, ruining the besieging Ñoldorin armies. The Ñoldor\n    eventually mustered a defense, but their losses were severe. For\n    instance, the green plain of Ard-galen had been permanently laid\n    waste by the rivers of fire, and was now called _Anfauglith_, the\n    Choking Dust; and the highlands of Dorthonion, which had been\n    inhabited by Edain, were made inhospitable.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The Nirnaeth Arnoediad was the first battle to be started by the\n    Ñoldor for the purpose of ending the power of Morgoth. They massed\n    an army composed of Elves, Edain, and the Easterling houses of Bór\n    and Ulfang allied to the Sons of Fëanor. The Elves and their allies\n    came very close to Angband, but Morgoth's trickery had upset their\n    battle plan, and Ulfang proved to be treacherous. The name\n    “Unnumbered Tears” comes from the fact that the Elves' last hope of\n    victory was destroyed. The land of Hithlum was lost, the Sons of\n    Fëanor were largely scattered, and the free peoples of Beleriand had\n    been decimated. The forces of Morgoth made a heap of the Elven and\n    Mannish dead in the center of Anfauglith.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The War of Wrath took place after Eärendil sailed to Valinor and\n    persuaded the Valar to help those whom they had forsaken. The Valar\n    gathered an army comprised of Maiar, Vanyar, and those Ñoldor who\n    had stayed in Valinor. The Teleri refused their aid, due to the\n    Kinslaying at Alqualondë, but consented to ferry the armies of the\n    Valar in their famous ships. This battle marked the first appearance\n    of the winged dragons, most notably Ancalagon the Black, but the\n    Valar had the day. Morgoth was captured, and cast out of Arda, but\n    his lands, as well as most of Beleriand, had been destroyed and sunk\n    under the sea in the heat of battle."

It\nwas an age of peace, and was also known as the “Age of Men”.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Fourth Age began after Sauron was vanquished and the One Ring was\ndestroyed. The Shire and the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor were restored.\nIt marked the ascent of Men and the final diminishing of the Elves.\nGandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Bilbo and Frodo sailed for the Undying\nLands.\n\nThe allies of Sauron suffered a devastating blow that would take them\ncenturies to recover, if they did at all. Harad was defeated and\nconcluded a peace with King Aragorn II Elessar, by which Umbar, whose\nfleet had been completely destroyed in the mouths of the Anduin, was\nreturned to Gondor, and South Gondor also annexed. The Easterlings also\nsuffered a terrible defeat as their Orc allies fled in terror from the\nBattle of the Black Gate. However, King Elessar, his descendants and\nallies such as King Éomer still on occasion warred with their enemies\nover land, particularly over the bitterly contested region of the Sea of\nRhûn. King Elessar died in FO 120 and was succeeded by his son Eldarion\nwho ruled until about FO 220. Of the kings of the Reunited Kingdom after\nhim, nothing is known.\n\nTolkien said that he thought the distance between the end of the Third\nAge and the 20th century A.D. was about 6000 years, and that 1958 should\nhave been around the end of the Fifth Age if the Fourth and Fifth Ages\nwere about the same length as the Second and Third Ages. He said,\nhowever, in a letter written in 1958 that he believed the Ages had\nquickened and that it was about the end of the Sixth Age or beginning of\nthe Seventh (this letter is referred to in the “Fourth Age” article of\n_The Encyclopedia of Arda,_ as mentioned below)."

    "text": "SINDARIN was the Elvish language most commonly spoken in Middle-earth\nduring in the Third Age - in the real world it is universally referred\nto as, when not in canonical context, “ELVEN” or “ELVISH”.\n\nThe written alphabet of Sindarin, as with Quenya, is typically Tengwar\n(the Feanorian Characters), although Cirth (Runes) can also be used.\n\n\nHistory\n\n It was the language of the Sindar,\nthose Teleri who chose to stay behind on the Great Journey of the Elves.\nIt was derived from an earlier language called “Common Telerin”. When\nthe Ñoldor came back to Middle-earth, they adopted the Sindarin\nlanguage, for the Sindar were more numerous and slower to learn the\nlanguage of Valinor, Quenya the Noldor's native language. Later events\nled to the banning of the use of Quenya within and around Beleriand\nleading to it's eventual use as a high language of law. Before the\ndownfall, most of the Men of Númenor also spoke the language. Knowledge\nof it was kept in the Númenorean realm in exile Gondor, especially among\nthe learned. Dwarves, notably Durin's Folk, used Sindarin when\ncommunicating with Elves. Sindarin is the language referred to as _the\nElven-tongue_ in _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\nTolkien originally imagined that the language which would become\n_Sindarin_ was spoken by the Ñoldor (second clan of Elves). However he\nlater decided that it was the language of the Sindar. For this reason it\nis called _Noldorin_ in the older material, such as the Etymologies.\nWhen Noldorin became Sindarin, it also adopted some features of the\noriginally unrelated language _Ilkorin_. Tolkien based the sound and\nsome of the grammar of his Noldorin/Sindarin on Welsh, and Sindarin\ndisplays of the consonant mutations that characterise the Celtic\n(especially Brythonic) languages. The language was also probably\ninfluenced to an extent by the Germanic languages, as Tolkien was a\nscholar of both Old English and Old Norse.\n\n\nGrammar\n\nSindarin is mainly analytic, though traits of its highly inflected\nprogenitor can still be seen.\n\nPhonology\n\nSindarin was designed to have a Welsh-like phonology. It has most of the\nsame sounds and similar phonotactics.\n\n  -------- ----- -------------------------------------------------------------\n  LETTER   IPA   NOTES\n  a              \n  b              \n  c              \n  ch             The “ch” in the German word “Buch”, not as in “church”\n  d              \n  dh             The “th” in “heather”\n  e              \n  f              Represents  when final or before n,  everywhere else.\n  g              \n  h              \n  hw             \n  i              Represents  when initial,  everywhere else.\n  l              \n  lh       ɬ     The same as the Welsh LL.\n  m              \n  n              \n  ng             Represents  when final,  everywhere else.\n  o              \n  p              \n  ph             Represents  when final,  everywhere else.\n  r              \n  rh             \n  s              \n  t              \n  th             The “th” in “heath”\n  u              \n  v              \n  w              \n  y              Pronounced like German _ü_\n  -------- ----- -------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn accent signifies a long vowel (á, é, etc.). In a monosyllabic word, a\ncircumflex is used (â, ê, etc.). However, for practical reasons, users\nof the ISO Latin-1 character set often substitute ý for ŷ.\n\nDiphthongs are _ai_ (pronounced like AIsle), _ei_ (dAY), _ui_ (tOO\nYoung), _au_ (cOW), and _oi_ (bOY). If the last diphthong finishes a\nword, it is spelt _aw_. There are also diphthongs _ae_ and _oe_ with no\nEnglish counterparts; Tolkien recommended to substitute _ai_ and _oi_\nrespectively if one does not care about details. If one does care, it is\nsimilar to pronouncing _a_ or _o_ respectively in the same syllable as\none pronounces an _e_ (as in pEt).\n\nIn archaic Sindarin, there was a vowel similar to German _ö_ (IPA: ),\nwhich Tolkien mostly transcribed as _œ_ (usually _not_ as _oe_ as is\noften found in publications like the Silmarillion, cf. _Nirnaeth\nArnoediad_ , _Goelydh_ ).\nThis vowel later came to be pronounced and is therefore transcribed as\nsuch .\n\nArchaic Sindarin also had a spirant _m_ or nasal _v_ (IPA: ), which was\ntranscribed as _mh_ (though always pronounced in later Sindarin).\n\nNouns\n\nPluralization\n\nSindarin plurals are characterised by _i-affection_, or _umlaut_. The\nSindarin term for this is _prestanneth_ (disturbance, affection). Almost\nall Sindarin words form their plurals like English man/men and\ngoose/geese — by changing the vowels in the word. The plural patterns\nare:\n\n-   In non-final syllables:\n    -   a > e — galadh > gelaidh\n    -   e > e — bereth > berith\n    -   i > i — dineth > dinith\n    -   o > e — gowest > gewist\n    -   u > y — tulus > tylys\n    -   y > y — (no example available)\n-   In final syllables:\n    -   a > ai — anar > enair\n    -   â > ai — tâl > tail\n    -   e > i — adaneth > edenith\n    -   ê > î — hên > hîn\n    -   i > i — brennil > brennil\n    -   î > î — dîs > dîs\n    -   o > y — brannon > brennyn\n    -   ó > ý — bór > býr\n    -   ô > ý — thôn > thýn\n    -   u > y — urug > yryg\n    -   û > ui — hû > hui\n    -   y > y — ylf > ylf\n    -   ý > ý — mýl > mýl\n    -   au > oe — naug > noeg\n\nNote that _ai_ can sometimes become _î_ (or, less commonly, _ý_).\n\nThe reason for this is that the primitive plural ending _-î_ (still\npresent in Quenya as _-i_) affected the vowels in the word by making\nthem higher and fronter. After this sound change occurred, the suffix\n_-î_ disappeared when all final vowels were lost.\n\nClass Plural\n\nSindarin also has several suffixes which denote a so-called class\nplural. For example, _-ath_ indicates a group of something, e. g.\n_elenath_ from elen (an archaic form of _êl_), meaning _star_ and\n_-ath_. It means _a group of stars_ or _all the stars in the sky_.\nAnother ending, _-rim_, is used to indicate a race, e. g. _nogothrim_\nfrom _nogoth_ — _dwarf_ and _-rim_, meaning _the race of dwarves_. The\nending _-hoth_ is generally used in an unfriendly sense, e. g.\n_gaurhoth_ from _gaur_ — _werewolf_ and _-hoth_, meaning\n_werewolf-host_.\n\nMutation\n\nSindarin has a complex series of mutations. There are three main\ndifferent types of mutations: _soft mutation_ (or lenition), _nasal\nmutation_ and _stop_ (occlusive) _mutation_. Additionally, a _mixed\nmutation_ is also observed after certain particles or prepositions.\nFinally, it is presumed that Sindarin also once had what we could call\nan _archaic spirantal mutation_ (also sometimes called _liquid mutation_\nby scholars). It is still uncertain whether this mutation is still\nproductive or if it only occurs in ancient constructs.\n\nInitial mutations must not be confused with assimilations that may occur\nin compound words (such as, for instance, in the names _Araphor_,\n_Arassuil_ and _Caradhras_).\n\nThe following table outlines how different consonants are affected by\nthe different mutations.\n\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n  BASIC   SOFT   NASAL   MIXED   STOP   LIQUID\n  b       v      m       b       b      v\n  c       g      ch      g       ch     ch\n  d       dh     n       d       d      dh\n  g       '      ng      g       g      '\n  h       ch     ch      h       ch     ch\n  lh      thl    'l      'l      thl    'l\n  m       v      m       m       m      v\n  p       b      ph      b       b      ph\n  rh      thr    'r      'r      thr    'r\n  s       s      s       h       s      s\n  t       d      th      d       th     th\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n\nHere the apostrophe indicates elision.\n\nWords beginning in _b-_, _d-_, or _g-_ which descend from older _mb-_,\n_nd-_, or _ng-_ are affected differently by the mutations:\n\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n  BASIC   SOFT   NASAL   MIXED   STOP   LIQUID\n  b       m      mb      mb      mb     b\n  d       n      nd      nd      nd     d\n  g       ng     g       g       g      g\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n\nTake, for example, the deictic article _i_, which triggers soft\nmutation. When added to a word like _tâl_, it becomes _i dâl_. In\nSindarin's phonological history, _t_ became _d_ in the middle of a word.\nBecause _i tâl_ at the time was considered one word, the _t_ became _d_,\nand thus _i dâl_. However, without the article the word is still _tâl_.\n\nMutation is triggered in various ways:\n\n-   Soft mutation, the most widely occurring mutation, is triggered by\n    the singular article _i_, the prefixes _athra-, ath-, go-, gwa-,\n    ú-,_ and _u-_, as well as the prepositions _ab, am, adel, be, dad,\n    di, na, nu,_ and _î_, and after _avo_. It also affects the second\n    element in a compound, an adjective following a noun, and the object\n    of a verb.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Nasal mutation is triggered by the plural article _in_, and the\n    prepositions _an, dan,_ and plural _'nin_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Mixed mutation is triggered by the genitive article _en_, and the\n    prepositions _ben, erin, nan, 'nin,_ and _uin_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Stop mutation is triggered by the prepositions _ed, ned,_ and\n    _o(d)_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Liquid mutation is presumably triggered by the preposition _or_.\n\nPronouns\n\nPronouns are perhaps the most poorly attested feature of Sindarin. What\nhas been reconstructed by the comparative method is largely conjectural\nand is not agreed upon, and therefore will not be addressed in this\narticle.\n\nSindarin pronouns, like those in English, still maintain some case\ndistinction. Sindarin pronouns have nominative, accusative, genitive,\nand dative forms.\n\n \n\nFirst Person\n\nSecond Person\n\nThird Person\n\n \n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nNominative\n\nim\n\nme\n\nle, ci\n\nle, ci\n\ne, te\n\nti\n\nAccusative\n\nnin\n\nmen\n\nlen, cin\n\nlen, cin\n\nten, den\n\ntin, hain\n\nGenitive\n\n \n\nmín\n\n \n\nlín\n\ndîn\n\n \n\nDative\n\nanim, enni\n\nammen\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEnclitic\n\n-n\n\n-m\n\n-ch\n\n \n\n—\n\n-r\n\nVerbs\n\nSindarin verbs are also quite complex. The number of attested verbs in\nSindarin is small, so the Sindarin verb system is imperfectly known; no\nverb has a full paradigm of forms available. There are two main types of\nverbs: _basic_ and _derived_. Basic verbs have stems which end in a\nconsonant, and derived verbs have stems which incorporate some sort\nderivational morpheme (such as a causative ending) which ends in _-a_.\n\nBasic Verbs\n\nBasic verbs, though smaller in number than derived verbs, have a very\ncomplex conjugation which arises from Sindarin's phonological history.\n\nBasic verbs form the infinitve by adding _-i_: _giri_ from _gir-_. This\nending causes an _a_ or _o_ in the stem to umlaut to _e_: _blebi_ from\n_blab-_. Sindarin does not use infinitive forms very often, and rather\nuses the gerund to achieve the same meaning.\n\nFor all persons except the third person singular, the present tense is\nformed by the insertion of _-i_, and the proper enclitic pronomial\nending: _girin_, _girim_, _girir_. As with the infinitive, _-i_ causes\nan _a_ or _o_ in the stem to umlaut to _e_: _pedin_, _pedim_, _pedir_,\nfrom _pad-_. The third person singular, because it has a zero-ending,\ndoes not require the insertion of _-i_. This leaves the bare stem,\nwhich, because of Sindarin's phonological history, causes the vowel of\nthe stem to become long: _gîr_, _blâb_, _pâd_.\n\nThe past tense of basic verbs is very complicated and poorly attested.\nOne common reconstructed system is to use _-n_: _darn_. However, the\nonly time this _-n_ actually remains is after a stem in _-r_. After a\nstem ending in _-l_, _-n_ becomes _-ll_: _toll_. After _-b, -d, -g, -v,_\nor _-dh_, it is metathesized and then assimilated to the same place of\narticulation as the consonant it now follows. The consonant then\nexperiences what could be called a “backwards mutation”: _-b, -d,_ and\n_-g_ become _-p, -b,_ and _-c_, and _-v_ and _-dh_ become _-m_ and _-d_.\nThe matter is complicated even further when pronomial endings are added.\nBecause _-mp, -mb, -nt, -nd,_ and _-nc_ did not survive medially, they\nbecome _-mm-, -mm-, -nn-, -nn-,_ and _-ng_. In addition, past tense\nstems in _-m_ would have _-mm-_ before any pronomial endings. Because\nthis all may seem rather overwhelming, look at these examples which show\nstep-by-step transformations:\n\n-   _cab-_ > **_cabn_ > **_canb_ > **_camb_ > _camp_, becoming _camm-_\n    with any pronomial endings.\n-   _ped-_ > **_pedn_ > **_pend_ > _pent_, becoming _penn-_ with any\n    pronomial endings.\n-   _dag-_ > **_dagn_ > **_dang_ (_n_ pronounced as in _men_) > **_dang_\n    (_n_ pronounced as in _sing_) > _danc_, becoming _dang-_ with any\n    pronomial endings.\n-   _lav-_ > **_lavn_ > **_lanv_ > **_lanm_ > **_lamm_ > _lam_, becoming\n    _lamm-_ before any pronomial endings.\n-   _redh-_ > **_redhn_ > **_rendh_ > **_rend_ > _rend_, becoming\n    _renn-_ before any pronomial endings.\n\nThe future tense is formed by the addition of _-tha_. An _-i_ is also\ninserted between the stem and _-tha_, which again causes _a_ and _o_ to\numlaut to _e_. Endings for all persons except for the first person\nsingular can be added without any further modification: _giritham_,\n_blebithar_. The first person singular ending _-n_ causes the _-a_ in\n_-tha_ to become _-o_: _girithon_, _blebithon_, _pedithon_.\n\nThe imperative is formed with the addition of _-o_ to the stem: _giro!_,\n_pado!_, _blabo!_.\n\nDerived Verbs\n\nDerived verbs have a much less complex conjugation because they have a\nthematic vowel (usually _a_) which reduces the number of consonant\ncombinations which occur.\n\nThe infinitive is formed with -o, which replaces the -a of the stem, e.\ng. _lacho_ from _lacha-_.\n\nThe present tense is formed without modification to the stem. Pronomial\nendings are added without any change.\n\nThe past tense is formed with the ending _-nt_, which becomes _-nne_\nwith any pronomial endings, e. g. _erthant_, _erthanner_.\n\nThe future tense is formed with _-tha_. With the addition of the first\nperson singular _-n_, this becomes _-tho_.\n\nThe imperative is formed like the infinitive.\n\n\nDialects\n\nDuring the First Age there were several dialects of Sindarin:\n\n-   _Doriathrin_ or the language of Doriath, a form of the language\n    which preserved many archaic forms;\n-   _Falathrin_ or the language of the Falas, later also spoken in\n    Nargothrond;\n-   _North Sindarin_, the dialects originally spoken in Dorthonion and\n    Hithlum by the Sindar, these dialects contained many unique words\n    and were not fully intelligible with the Sindarin of Beleriand\n    proper.\n\nWith the exception of Doriathrin, the dialects were changed under\nÑoldorin influence, and adopted many Quenya features, as well as unique\nsound changes devised by the Ñoldor (who loved changing languages). The\ndistinct dialects disappeared after the Ñoldor and Sindar were dispersed\nduring the later Battles of Beleriand. In the refuges on the Isle of\nBalar and the Mouths of Sirion a new dialect arose under the refugees,\nwhich mainly took after Falathrin. During the Second Age and Third Age\nSindarin was a lingua franca for all Elves and their friends, until it\nwas displaced as the Common tongue by Westron, a descendant of Adûnaic\nwhich was heavily influenced by Sindarin.\n\n_Sindarin_ is actually a Quenya term. The Sindarin word was perhaps\nEDHELLEN (“Elvish”).\n\n\nSample Phrases\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings_\n\n-   _Ai na vedui Dúnadan! Mae govannen!_ - Ah, at last, Westman! Well\n    met!\n-   _Noro lim._ - Run fast.\n-   _Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!

    "text": "The WAR OF THE RING was fought between Sauron and the free people of\nMiddle-earth for control of the One Ring and dominion over the\ncontinent. It took place at the end of the Third Age. Together with the\nQuest of Mount Doom, it is one of the overarching plot-lines of _The\nLord of the Rings_.\n\nThe war was initiated by Sauron, who had gained strength since the end\nof the Second Age and sought the One Ring. During the War of the Ring,\nmany thousands of Men of Rohan and Men of Gondor were killed. The\noverall number of combatants in the war is estimated to be over one\nmillion—tens of thousands from the side of the Free Peoples and hundreds\nof thousands from the Evil side. The war also signified the decline of\nthe Elves' power in Middle-earth, the rise of Men in the West, the\nrestoration of the King of Gondor and Arnor and the start of the Fourth\nAge.\n\nBattles were fought in Gondor, Rohan, Lórien, Mirkwood, at the Lonely\nMountain and at Dale. These were primarily waged against Sauron's\nforces, but Saruman, a third contender, also had armies, who fought\nbattles at the Fords of Isen and Helm's Deep.\n\nThe first full-scale battle fought in the war was the first Battle of\nthe Fords of Isen, and the war ended after the Battle of Bywater and,\nshortly afterwards, the deaths of Saruman and Gríma Wormtongue. Towards\nthe end of the War of the Ring, Elessar was crowned King of Gondor, and\nforgave the Men who had fought under Sauron, heralding a great renewal\nof cooperation and communication between Men, Elves, and Dwarves.\n\n\nOrigins of the War\n\nAccording to Mithrandir, the War of the Ring had begun at the\ntime Thorin Oakenshield met Bilbo Baggins in The Shire. Gandalf's\nreasoning is explained in the book _Unfinished Tales_. This is an\nexcerpt from a narrative of Gandalf to Frodo set in a house in Minas\nTirith. “_You may think that Rivendell was out of his reach, but I did\nnot think so. The state of things in the North was very bad. The Kingdom\nUnder the Mountain and the Strong Men of Dale were no more. To resist\nany force that Sauron might send North to regain Angmar were only the\nDwarves of the Iron Hills, and behind them lay desolation and a Dragon.\nThe Dragon Sauron might use with terrible effect._” That is why Gandalf\nthought that he had to get rid of Smaug, and he chanced upon Thorin and\nBilbo at different times, and saw the way to do it, which is told in\n_The Hobbit_.\n\nGandalf's role\n\nGandalf was to the Free Peoples of Middle-earth as a field marshal is to\nhis army fighting on the field—a master strategist and tactician. As\nseen in the opening stages of _The Fellowship of the Ring_ book and\nmovie, Gandalf the Grey would spend many hours, searching, scavenging,\nand sifting out archaic maps and accounts in long-hidden archives strewn\nabout Middle-earth. He would often carefully examine them, figuring out\nthe best way to defeat the Enemy and marshal as many allies as possible\nto his cause.\n\nGandalf likely spent much thought in strategy, before implementing his\nplans to maximum effect. He had been roaming Middle-earth for many years\nduring the Third Age, before Sauron's power was at its apex. He might\nhave had a 'hit list' of targets to neutralize that Sauron might use in\nthe next war upon the Free Peoples. One of these targets was Smaug, as\nseen in _The Hobbit._\n\nGandalf's adaptability and aptitude for strategy proved invaluable to\nhis allies during the complicated web that was to prove to become the\nWar of the Ring. As told in _Unfinished Tales_, Gandalf had known for\nquite a while that Sauron's use of Smaug would virtually guarantee\nvictory over his enemies, namely those of Gondor. He and his Dwarf\ncompanions thus set out to destroy Smaug, and bring the victory of the\nWar of the Ring one step closer for the Free Peoples.\n\nThe Roles of the other Istari\n\nSaruman became the secondary enemy in the War of the Ring, originally\nhaving served the Free Peoples and eventually succumbing to the power of\nthe One Ring.\n\nThe two Blue Wizards, Alatar and Pallando, also served an important role\nin the outcome of the war. Although they weren't directly mentioned in\nthe _Lord of the Rings_, they were enemies of Sauron, and might have\nused the Dark Elves and the Dwarves of the Red Mountains to weaken the\nEasterlings.\n\n\nEvents\n\nSouthern Theatre\n\nThe objective of Sauron's grand strategy was to defeat the strongest of\nthe nations that opposed him, Gondor, and to do so he would need to take\nthe capital city and greatest fortress of Gondor, Minas Tirith. To this\nend, the war effort of Mordor was focused in the south in and around\nGondor, in a strategy of divide and conquer. To keep Gondor's ally\nRohan, on its northern border, from sending aid, Sauron promoted the\nrise of Saruman at Isengard to the west of Rohan. Thus all of Rohan's\nforces would be focused in the west trying to stem the tide of the\nIsengard attack, and none would be sent to Minas Tirith's defence.\nMeanwhile, Sauron sent the Mordor-allied Corsairs of Umbar to attack\nGondor's populous southern coastal fiefs, which as a result sent only a\nfraction of their forces to defend Minas Tirith in northern Gondor,\nwhile the rest stayed on the coasts preparing for the Corsair assault.\nHowever, Sauron's divide and conquer strategy was ultimately foiled and\na united front of Gondor and Rohan's forces faced Mordor.\n\nRohan\n\nThe War of the Ring started in Rohan when Saruman's troops crossed the\nFords of Isen. Théodred, the son of the King Théoden, had mustered his\nforces on the fords in order to launch a surprise attack against the\nenemy. On February 23, 3019 he attacked the vanguard of the Orcs\nmarching out of Isengard. Reinforcements were quickly sent from Isengard\nhowever, and Théodred ordered a retreat. His forces retreated to an\nisland in the fords, but they were soon surrounded and he was killed.\nGrimbold managed to hold the island, but would not have succeeded if\nElfhelm had not come with reinforcements from Helm's Deep. Thus the\nfirst battle of the Fords of Isen ended in victory for the Rohirrim.\n\nNow that the Marshal of the Westmark was dead, Erkenbrand took command\nof the Westfold. He placed Grimbold and Elfhelm at the Fords. However,\nthey were unable to withstand the force of Isengard, and were\nsurrounded. Though they successfully broke through the enemy's lines,\nthey ended up scattered around the Westfold, giving Saruman clear\npassage into Rohan.\n\nMeanwhile, Gandalf drove Gríma Wormtongue out of Edoras and went to\ngather Erkenbrand's scattered forces, advising King Théoden to move to\nthe stronghold of Helm's Deep. The king and his forces arrived\nunmolested, but soon the fortress was surrounded by Saruman's troops.\nAll through the night of March 3rd-4th a combined force of Orcs and Wild\nMen from Dunland besieged Helm's Deep, and despite the efforts of the\nRohirrim (aided by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli) hope appeared lost.\nBelieving Rohan was lost, Théoden decided to mount a final, suicidal\ncharge against Saruman's forces. Unexpectedly, however, Gandalf arrived\nin the nick of time with Erkenbrand and the scattered Rohirrim, along\nwith a forest of Huorns who had been sent to the battle by Treebeard.\nThe Orcs were trapped and utterly annihilated. The wild Men were taken\ncaptive, however, were freed after swearing an oath of loyalty to Rohan\nand clearing the battlefield of the dead. (The mercy of this act amazed\nthe captives, who had been told by Saruman that the men of Rohan were\ncruel and burned their captives alive.)\n\nDays before, at an Entmoot in Fangorn Forest, the Ents, furious over the\ndestruction Saruman had wrought upon the forest, decided to march on\nIsengard. They were to move up to Isengard and destroy it. By 3 March\nthe destruction was completed, and the command of Isengard was taken by\nthe Ent Treebeard. At Gandalf's request he sent a large herd of Huorns\nto the Battle of Hornburg, to aid the Rohirrim.\n\nGondor\n\nFor over 3000 years, the realm of Gondor had held back the threat from\nthe East. In time, the kingdom declined, and Sauron prepared to swoop in\nfor the kill. Faramir, captain of Gondor, had divided his forces to too\nmany fronts. The two most important of these were in the island citadel\nof Cair Andros and the ruined city of Osgiliath. In a strict sense, the\nWar of the Ring began with the Great Signal from Minas Morgul and the\nanswering signal from Mount Doom, and thus the attack on Osgiliath was\nthe first battle of the war proper. Sauron's two armies obliterated the\nfortresses, and Faramir was forced to retreat to the causeway forts, the\nlast defence against the Morgul forces. Soon these too were destroyed,\nand only Minas Tirith remained.\n\nThe attack soon began, as the Nazgûl hovered above and spread terror and\nconfusion, and siege towers tried to take the walls but were all\ndestroyed. After several repulsed attacks, the Gate of Minas Tirith was\nbroken, and the Lord of the Nazgûl entered. He was the first and only\nenemy to do so. All seemed lost — until six thousand Rohirrim, under\nKing Théoden's command, came and somewhat relieved Gondor's defenders.\nStill, the battle was in doubt until Aragorn arrived with a large force\nout of South Gondor. The joint force of Gondor and Rohan then\nsuccessfully defeated their enemies after an exhausting day of fighting.\nThis battle resulted in the deaths of the Witch-king of Angmar, King\nTheoden, and Denethor, Steward of Gondor.\n\nThe Battle of the Morannon was the final major battle against Sauron in\nthe War of the Ring, fought at the Black Gate of Mordor. The Army of the\nWest, roughly 6,000 strong, led by Aragorn marched on the gate and faced\na vastly larger force as a diversionary feint to distract Sauron's\nattention from Frodo and Sam, who were carrying the One Ring through\nMordor. It was hoped that Sauron would think Aragorn had the Ring and\nwas now trying to use it to overthrow Mordor. Despite the seemingly\nimpossible odds the Army of the West was eventually victorious, for when\nthe Ring was destroyed, Sauron's forces fled or surrendered in dismay.\n\nNorthern Theatre\n\nMordor's war effort was focused in the south against Gondor, but using\nhis outstretched right arm Sauron attempted to flank the lands of the\nFree Peoples through Rhovanion, using orcs and allied barbarian nations\nof Men. In this theatre of the war (which had spread far across\nMiddle-earth) Sauron's primary objective was to use the forces at his\nprimary base of operations in the area, Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood,\nto defeat Lothlórien, then pass the Misty Mountains (attacking\nRivendell), and wheel around to take Rohan and Gondor from the rear.\nHowever, Dol Guldur had to deal with the threat of the Woodland Realm of\nThranduil, and thus split their forces between the attack on Lothlórien\nand the one on the Woodland Realm. Sauron wanted to use his barbarian\nEasterling allies in a joint attack with the Orcs from Dol Guldur on the\nWoodland Realm, and then have this victorious army link up with the\nother ones attacking Lothlórien and defeat it. However, unfortunately\nfor Sauron a strong and extremely powerful Dwarf nation now existed at\nthe Lonely Mountain thanks to the efforts of Gandalf, as well as the\nDwarves of the Iron Hills and allied Men of Dale. Mordor's Easterling\nallies were tied up fighting the Dwarves of Erebor and Men of Dale,and\nnever linked up with the Mordor forces assaulting the Woodland Realm,\nwhich in turn could not link up with those attacking Lothlórien, and the\nline held.\n\nBridging the gap between the northern and southern theatres of the war\nwas the line of the River Anduin between Lothlórien and Gondor, running\nalong the Rohan border. Orc armies peeling off from the assault on\nLothlórien tried to enter Rohan via this route, while almost its entire\narmy had left to fight at Minas Tirith, but the Ents of Fangorn forest\ncounterattacked and drove the orcs back in a panic, and most if not all\ndrowned while attempting to flee by crossing the river.\n\nDale and the Lonely Mountain\n\nWhen the war began, the Dwarves of Erebor\nrefused to cooperate with Sauron in his hunt for the Ring. And so Sauron\nsent an army of Easterlings to Dale. On March 17 they met the armies of\nthe Dwarves of Erebor (and of the Iron Hills as well) and the Men of\nDale. After three days of fighting, Men and Dwarves were overrun, Dale\nwas sacked and razed to ash (the second, possibly third, time in a\ncentury) and sought refuge in Erebor. The defenses of the Lonely\nMountain were prepared for the battle that would decide the fate of\nnorthern Middle-earth, and possibly even the War of the Ring itself.\n\nThe Easterlings hurled their full force at the allied armies, exploiting\ntheir dreaded heavy infantry force to punch a hole in the Dwarvish and\nMannish lines. A furious melee ensued, evolving into a tempest of fire,\ndead and dying men, and the flash of steel. Both sides took horrendous\nlosses, the Easterlings from the arrows, spears, and rocks cast from the\nLonely Mountain's cliffs, and the Men and Dwarves from the scimitars and\nmaces of the Easterlings. Finally, King Brand of Dale fell before the\ngate of the Lonely Mountain, and King under the Mountain Dáin II\nIronfoot fell as he was defending Brand's body.\n\nThe Dwarves of Erebor had learnt a crucial lesson from the devastation\nof Smaug and the Battle of the Five Armies nearly a century earlier, a\nlesson bought with the blood of loved ones. They fortified all of the\nsides of the Lonely Mountain, preventing the breakthrough of orcs that\nnearly caused the loss of the Battle in the days of Bilbo Baggins and\nThorin Oakenshield. The defenders knew with grim fatalism that there\nwould be no Beorn and no Eagles to save them this time, and they were\nthus determined to fight to the last. The Lonely Mountain was staged to\nbecome the Minas Tirith of the North, a ruthless battle of the will of\nthe defender and the will of the aggressor.\n\nThe invaders from the east constructed siege works, battering rams, and\nassorted siege catapults to bombard their enemies into submission.\nHowever, despite all of their efforts, the great gates of the Lonely\nMountain withstood the tidal wave of invaders from the East. Many Men\nand Dwarves made their escape to Erebor however and were able to\nwithstand the siege of the mountain fastness. When news spread about the\nvictory in the South, the Easterlings became extremely demoralized and\nproceeded to scatter, while the sons of Brand and Dáin let their army\nout of Erebor to break the encirclement.\n\nLothlórien and Mirkwood\n\nOn March 11, Lothlórien was first attacked from Dol Guldur. It was\nattacked two further times, on the 15 and the 22. When the Dark Lord had\nfallen, Celeborn led his army out of Lóerin, and crossed the Anduin. Dol\nGuldur was captured and destroyed by Galadriel.\n\nThranduil of Mirkwood was also attacked from Dol Guldur on March 15\nresulting in the long Battle Under the Trees, in which Thranduil's\nkinfolk won a hard victory. After the destruction of Dol Guldur,\nCeleborn met Thranduil on April 6, and as the shadow had passed, they\ndivided Mirkwood and renamed it Eryn Lasgalen.\n\nThe Shire\n\nAfter the defeat of the Dark Lord, Saruman used the magic of his voice\nto convince Treebeard to release him from Isengard. He travellled to the\nShire, where he replaced Lotho Sackville-Baggins as the Chief under the\nname _Sharkey_. Under his command Ruffian men entered The Shire and\nruined it. They were defeated by Hobbits under the lead of Meriadoc\nBrandybuck and Peregrin Took in the Battle of Bywater on the 3rd of\nNovember. The Hobbits headed to Hobbiton where Frodo ordered Saruman and\nWormtongue to leave the Shire. Wormtongue, however, killed Saruman,\nbefore he himself was killed by the Hobbits and their arrows. With the\ndeath of the wizard Saruman, the War of the Ring finally ended, as did\nthen the Third Age.\n\n\nConsequences and Legacy\n\nThe War of the Ring had great influence on all of the lands of the\nnorthwest of Middle-earth. Most importantly it led to the restoration of\nthe Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor as the Reunited Kingdom, under King\nElessar Telcontar. The Steward of Gondor was dead, but he was succeeded\nby his son Faramir, who kept the office and was given the title _Prince\nof Ithilien_.\n\nIn Rohan the heir apparent, Théodred, was killed, and, during the Battle\nof Pelennor Fields, King Théoden died as well. He was succeeded by his\nnephew Éomer. In the Glittering Caves at the Hornburg, a Dwarven colony\nwas established, and Isengard was given to the Ents, who filled\nSaruman's pits and reforested the land, renaming it The Treegarth of\nOrthanc\n\nIn Dale, both King Brand and King Dáin II Ironfoot were killed, who were\nsucceeded by their sons Bard and Thorin III Stonehelm. They sent their\nemissaries to the crowning of Elessar, and were in alliance with Gondor\nuntil their Kingdoms ended.\n\nFor the Elves, the final decline had begun. With the destruction of the\nOne Ring, the power of the Three Rings faded, and the kingdoms that had\nbeen preserved by their magic began to fade with them. The bearers of\nthe Rings left Middle-earth, and Lórien was eventually abandoned. The\nElves of Lothlórien who did not depart over the Sea moved east to the\nsouthern third of Mirkwood, below the Narrows, which they named East\nLórien. In Eryn Lasgalen however, Thranduil's rule continued, and they\nhad peace. There was also an Elven colony in Ithilien. Many of the Elves\nof Rivendell departed over the Sea, and by Aragorn's death 120 years\nlater, it was entirely deserted.\n\nIn the Shire life continued as it had prior to the war. It was declared\na free land under the Sceptre of Annúminas, and Men were forbidden to\nenter it. The Westmarch was added to the Shire by King Elessar in SR\n1452.\n\nThe different races of Men that had served Sauron suffered grievously at\nthe hands of what appeared to be booty and loot just begging them to\ncome; much of Harad's army was annihilated on the Pelennor Fields,\nslaughtered by the swords of Gondor and the lances of Rohan. The mighty\nEasterlings hastily retreated back to their homelands after Sauron's\nfall and fought several territorial wars with King Elessar over lands\nnear the Sea of Rhûn, but ceased to be a threat altogether. While they\nwere still a menace, much like a sleeping viper, they never troubled the\nReunited Kingdom again.\n\nOnce the Fourth Age began, the elves stopped having an active influence\non the affairs of Middle-earth, having started fading away ever since\nthe Third Age. Orcs never became a serious threat again, reduced to\nsmall bands of mountain brigands they were never more than a nuisance.\nAll the Nazgûl were killed, with Sauron reduced to a mere shadow of\nmalice. Wars would still be fought by the Reunited Kingdom and Rohan\nagainst the Men that had allied with Sauron, the Haradrim and\nEasterlings."

    "text": "ROHIRRIC was the language of the Rohirrim of Rohan.\n\nIn the novels it is always represented by the Mercian dialect\nof Anglo-Saxon. This is because Tolkien saw the relationship between\nRohirric and the Common Speech to be the same as that of Anglo-Saxon and\nEnglish, which was used to represent Westron. Only a few actual Rohirric\nwords are given by Tolkien: _kûd-dûkan_, an old word meaning\n“hole-dweller” which led to _kuduk_, the name the Hobbits had for\nthemselves. Even these terms were translated in the book: “hobbit” is\nsaid to derive from the Anglo-Saxon construction “hol-bytla”, or\nhole-builder.\n\nThe only other Rohirric given is the element “lô–”/“loh–” corresponding\nto Anglo-Saxon “éo” (horse), and the derived names _Lôgrad_ for\n_Horse-Mark_, and _Lohtûr_ for _Éothéod_, horse-people, or horse-land.\n\nAll names beginning with Éo– are actually names beginning with Lô– or\nLoh–, but the real forms of Éomer, Éowyn etc. are not given. Only one\nproper name is given, that of Théoden: the actual form was _Tûrac_,\nwhich implies that Rohirric had adopted the Sindarin element “tur–” also\npresent in names like Turgon, with meaning power/mastery (i.e. King).\n\nThe languages of the Kingdom of Rhovanion, Esgaroth, and Dale (often\ncalled Dalish or Dale-ish) were related to Rohirric.\n\nde:Rohirrische Sprache it:Rohirric ru:Роханский язык"

    "text": "UNFINISHED TALES (fully titled _UNFINISHED TALES OF NÚMENOR AND\nMIDDLE-EARTH_) is a collection of stories by J.R.R. Tolkien that were\nnever completed during his lifetime, but were edited and concluded by\nhis son Christopher Tolkien and published in 1980.\n\n\nPublication and edition\n\nUnlike _The Silmarillion_, in which the narrative fragments were\nmodified to connect into a consistent and coherent work, the _Unfinished\nTales_ are presented as Tolkien left them, with little more than names\nchanged (the author having had a confusing habit of trying out different\nnames for a character while writing a draft). Thus some of these are\nincomplete stories, while others are collections of “factual”\ninformation about Middle-earth. Each tale is followed by a long series\nof Christopher's notes explaining inconsistencies and obscure points.\n\nAs with _The Silmarillion_, Christopher Tolkien edited and published\n_Unfinished Tales_ before he had finished his study of the materials in\nhis father's archive. Despite its shortcomings in editorial consistency,\n_Unfinished Tales_ does provide more detailed information about\ncharacters, events and places mentioned only briefly in _The Lord of the\nRings_. Versions of such tales including the origins of Gandalf and the\nWizards, the death of Isildur and the loss of the One Ring in the\nGladden Fields, and the founding of the kingdom of Rohan help expand\nknowledge about Middle-earth.\n\nOf particular note is the tale of Tar-Aldarion and Erendis (chapter two\nof Part Two), the only known story of Númenor before its fall. A map of\nNúmenor is also included in the book.\n\nThe _Unfinished Tales_ had commercial success, demonstrating that the\ndemand for Tolkien's stories several years after his death was not only\nstill present, it was actually growing.

    "text": "The Lords of Andúnië were the rulers of a noble house of Númenor in the\nSecond Age.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Lords of Andúnië named for their ancestral home of Andúnië were\ndescended from Silmariën, daughter and oldest child of Tar-Elendil the\nfourth King of Númenor. The laws of Númenor at that time would not allow\nher to rule as queen, so she wedded Elatan of Andúnië and took up\nresidence there. Their son Valandil would be named the first Lord of\nAndúnië in about the seventh century of the Second Age.\n\nThroughout the Second Age, the Lords of Andúnië became leaders of the\nElendili, or Elf-friends, for remaining friends with the Elves and\nfaithful to the Valar. This was despite opposition and eventually\npersecution from the King's Men.\n\nAt the end of the Second Age, Númenor's estrangement from the Elves and\nthe Valar under the evil guidance of Sauron corrupted Númenórean\nsociety. Seeking pardon of the Valar for the wickedness of the\nNúmenóreans, Amandil the Faithful, Lord of Andúnië, sailed into the west\nbut was never heard of again.\n\nHis son Elendil, the last Lord of Andúnië, did not join Ar-Pharazôn's\ngrand armada to attack Valinor, and instead fled with his sons Isildur\nand Anárion and many of the Faithful to Middle-earth, where they founded\nthe lines of the Kings of Gondor and Arnor.\n\nElendil brought with him the Sceptre of Andúnië, the instrument of his\nlordship, which became a hereditary emblem of royal authority in Arnor,\nalong with the Ring of Barahir. It later became known as the Sceptre of\nAnnúminas and by the Third Age thought to be the oldest artifact made by\nMen in Middle-earth.\n\nit:Signori di Andúnië\n\n Category:Men"

    "text": "The Kin-strife was a disastrous civil war in Gondor in the Third Age.\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe unrest that created the Kin-strife began when Valacar, the son of\nthe Gondor king Rómendacil II, married a woman of the Northmen of\nRhovanion, Vidunavi. She bore him a son Eldacar, but many of the people\nof Gondor of Númenórean blood were angered by this mixing of blood of\nMiddle Men and Númenóreans, and the coastal provinces rebelled when\nValacar grew old.\n\n\nCivil War\n\nWhen in TA 1432 Eldacar succeeded his father the unrest grew into open\nrebellion, as many people saw Eldacar as a half-breed who had no right\nto rule. The chief of them was his distant relative Castamir the\nUsurper, Lord of Ships, who in TA 1437 usurped the throne, forcing\nEldacar into exile. Castamir was supported by the people of the realm of\nUmbar, who sought revenge against Gondor. During the rebellion Osgiliath\nwas burned, and the great Dome of Stars was lost, together with its\nPalantír. Castamir also murdered Eldacar's son and heir Ornendil.\nEldacar fled to Rhovanion, and Castamir ruled in his stead.\n\nA full decade later, in TA 1447, Eldacar returned with Rhovanion troops;\nat the same time a rebellion against Castamir's cruel rule took place.\nEldacar managed to kill Castamir at the Battle of Erui, but Castamir's\nsons and many of their supporters fled south to Umbar. Eldacar could not\nfollow them, as the fleet was under Castamir's control.\n\nNot only did Gondor lose the city of Umbar for four centuries and gain a\nnew enemy in the Corsairs of Umbar, descendants of Castamir's sons, but\nalso many of the Númenóreans of purest blood were killed during the\ncivil war, leaving Gondor weakened.\n\nThe Kin-strife was, along with the Great Plague and sheer laziness one\nof the chief reasons for the abandonment of the fortresses in and\nsurrounding Mordor."

    "text": "The BATTLE OF FORNOST was the decisive battle between the forces of\nAngmar, under the Witch-king, and of Eärnur, the Crown Prince of Gondor,\nin the year TA 1975 that ended the evil northern Kingdom of Angmar.\n\n\nHistory\n\nA year prior to the battle, the armies of Angmar conquered Arthedain,\nthe last realm of Arnor. Angmar's armies had taken Fornost, the capital\nof the Dúnedain, and Arvedui, the last King of Arnor, had drowned in the\nIce-Bay of Forochel. A year later, a fleet of ships under Eärnur arrived\nin the Grey Havens and set off toward what was left of the once-great\nnorthern kingdom. With the armies of Gondor came men from Rhovanion,\nelves from Lindon, and the remainder of the Dúnedain (among them\nAranarth, the Prince of Arthedain). According to Shire historians, a\ncompany of archers was also sent to the battle.\n\nThe battle itself did not take place in the city of Fornost, but on the\nplains to the west of the city, near Lake Evendim. The armies of Angmar\nhurried west to meet the assault, and seeing this, the cavalry of Gondor\nrode north into the Hills of Evendim to wait in ambush. As the main part\nof the army of Gondor met the enemy in battle, the Gondor cavalry set\nout from the hills to strike the rear of the army of Angmar. This served\nas the turning point in the battle, and allowed the combined armies of\nthe west to gain the advantage. Realizing that his forces were all but\ncompletely destroyed, the Witch-king of Angmar fled eastward. As he\nfled, an army led by Glorfindel came up out of the south and blocked his\nescape, destroying what was left of his crumbling army; the Witch-king\nhimself was able to escape during the night and fled southward. Though\nthe battle itself had been lost and Angmar utterly destroyed, Sauron was\nextremely pleased with the Witch-King's work, for the destruction of the\nnorthern kingdoms of the Dúnedain was a victory for the Dark Powers\nwhich far exceeded the loss of the Witch-King's realm.",

    "page_id": "653",
    "text": "THE SHIRE is subdivided into several regions.\n\n\nFarthings\n\nThe original parts of the Shire were subdivided into four FARTHINGS\n(“fourth-ings” or “quarterings”): the Three-Farthing stone marked the\npoint where the borders of the Eastfarthing, Westfarthing and\nSouthfarthing of the Shire came together, by the Great East Road.\n\nThe Northfarthing\n\nThe Northfarthing is the least populated part of the Shire. This was the\nsite of the historic Battle of Greenfields.\n\n-   LONG CLEEVE was the home of the small part of the Took clan known as\n    the _North-Tooks_, descendants of Bandobras “Bullroarer” Took, who\n    settled here after the Battle of Greenfields.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The village of HARDBOTTLE was the home to the Bracegirdle family of\n    Hobbits, to whom Lobelia Sackville-Baggins belonged. Some maps\n    erroneously place Hardbottle in the Southfarthing.\n\nThe Westfarthing\n\nThe western and most populated part of the Shire, this is the site of\nthe towns Michel Delving, Tuckborough (part of Took-land), and Hobbiton.\n\n-   MICHEL DELVING is the chief town of the Shire, located in the White\n    Downs. Its name means simply “large excavation”.\n\n        The Mayor of Michel Delving is the only elected official of The\n        Shire, elected on a seven year term.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   HOBBITON is the village where Bag End is located. This is the home\n    of Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins and the site of the beginning and\n    conclusion of the novels _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_.\n    Sam Gamgee and his grandfather, the “Gaffer”, live on the lane of\n    _Bagshot Row_, below Bag End.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Bywater is a village a short walk east of Hobbiton. It is best known\n    as the home of two inns, The Green Dragon Inn and The Ivy Bush.\n\nThe Southfarthing\n\nA rural and fertile area, the Southfarthing is the site of the towns\nGamwich (original home of the Gamgee family), Cotton, Longbottom and\nmuch pipe-weed production.\n\n-   LONGBOTTOM, a name meaning “long valley”, was founded by Tobold\n    Hornblower with the introduction of pipe-weed, in TA 2670, allowing\n    the region to become well established due to the success of the\n    pipe-weed industry.\n\nThe Eastfarthing\n\nBorders on Buckland, contains the towns Frogmorton and Whitfurrows and\nthe farms of the Marish. Originally, the Eastfarthing was under the\ncontrol of the Oldbuck family. Even after these became the Brandybucks,\nthe farmers of the Eastfarthing followed the Brandybucks rather than the\nThain and Mayor.\n\n-   THE YALE is the name of the low-lying lands of the Shire's\n    Eastfarthing that lay along the northern side of the long road from\n    Stock westwards to Tuckborough. This seems to have been a sparsely\n    populated area, and in fact the map of the Shire in _The Lord of the\n    Rings_ marks only a single building here.\n    -   The meaning of the Yale's name is obscure. The well-known\n        English personal and placename “Yale” has its origins in a Welsh\n        expression meaning “fertile upland.” Its use may suggest that\n        the Hobbits who named it had contacts with “strange” languages,\n        possibly those of Dunland.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   THE MARISH is the name of fertile, yet boggy farmlands located in\n    the Shire's Eastfarthing. It is where the Oldbuck family is believed\n    to have lived before Gorhendad Oldbuck removed the family across the\n    Brandywine to Buckland and changed their name\n\n\nOther parts of the Shire\n\nThe Buckland and Westmarch are sometimes reckoned part of the Shire,\nthough they are not part of any Farthing. Buckland was described in\nChapter V _A conspiracy unmasked_ in Fellowship of the Ring as being\n_“virtually a small independent country.. a sort of colony of the\nShire.”_ Westmarch became part of the Shire only after the end of the\nevents portrayed in Lord of the Rings, in the fourth age.\n\nBuckland\n\nLocation, villages and borders\n\nBuckland is located east of the Baranduin (Brandywine) river. The\nhobbits living in Buckland grew the High Hay, a hedge, to protect\nthemselves against evil from the nearby Old Forest, which borders\nBuckland to the east. Buckland is bordered in the north by the Hay Gate,\nthe only entrance to Buckland near the Brandywine Bridge. In the south\nthe borders of Buckland follow the High Hay until the Withywindle joins\nthe Baranduin near the village of Haysend. The most important town of\nBuckland is _BUCKLEBURY_ where the Brandy Hall is located, home of the\nMaster of Buckland, one of the important officials of the Shire.\n\nAn important landmark is the _BUCKLEBURY FERRY_, a raft-ferry used as\nthe second main crossing point of the Brandywine River from the Shire to\nBuckland, after the Brandywine Bridge (which is twenty miles further\nsouth). It is apparently left unmanned to be used by hobbit travellers\nas needed. En route to the new house at Crickhollow, Frodo, Sam, Merry\nand Pippin crossed using the Ferry just before the arrival of a Black\nRider, who was forced to go around to the Brandywine Bridge as there\nwere no boats kept on the western bank of the river.\n\nHistory and Culture\n\nBuckland was settled around TA 2340 by Gorhenhad Oldbuck, the ancestor\nof Meriadoc Brandybuck. Gorhenhad Oldbuck thus became the first Master\nof Buckland. He renamed himself Brandybuck, which remained his family's\nname.\n\nBecause Buckland is east of the Baranduin it isn't part of the land\ngiven to the Hobbits by King Argeleb II of Arthedain. It was thus not\npart of the Shire proper until the beginning of the Fourth Age when King\nElessar made Buckland and the Westmarch officially a part of the Shire.\n\nThe Bucklanders are unlike other hobbits as they are prepared for danger\nand are thus less naive than the Shire-hobbits. They close the Hay Gate\nand their own front doors at night and are prepared to rush to arms when\nthe Horn of Buckland is blown. Most Bucklanders were originally of Stoor\nstock, and they were the only Hobbits known to use boats.\n\nThe Westmarch\n\nAfter the events of the War of the Ring at the start of the Fourth Age\nof Middle-earth, King Aragorn Elessar granted the Hobbits of the Shire\neffective self-rule inside his Reunited Kingdom, banning any men from\nentering the land.\n\nHe also granted the Shire a stretch of new land: this reached from the\nancient western borders of the Shire, the White Downs, to the Tower\nHills.\n\nThe area between the downs and the hills became known as the WESTMARCH.\n\nThe eldest daughter of mayor Samwise Gamgee, Elanor the Fair, married\nFastred of Greenholm, and they moved to the Westmarch. After the passing\nof master Samwise, they and their children became known as the\n_Fairbairns of the Towers_ or _Wardens of Westmarch_, and the Red Book\nof Frodo and Bilbo Baggins passed into their keeping, becoming known as\nthe _Red Book of Westmarch_.\n\nGovernmentally, the Westmarch was a region of itself, and like Buckland\nacross the river Brandywine it was not part of any of the four Farthings\nof the Shire."

Beren was\nnow the last person of the house of Bëor but in the Second Age some\nfamilies of Númenor still spoke Adûnaic with a notable Bëorian accent.\n\nFurthermore, the majority of faithful were those of Bëorian descent.\nThis was because the majority of the Men of Bëor had settled in the\nwestern part of Númenor, which later became the area controlled by the\nfaithful Lords of Andúnië. Traits of the House of Bëor were passed down\nto the Dúnedain of the Middle-earth and can be seen in Aragorn II\nElessar's physical description: lean, dark and tall, with “a shaggy head\nof dark hair flecked with grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keen\ngrey eyes.”\n\n\nNotable members\n\n-   BËOR THE OLD, originally named Balan and later given the title _the\n    Old_, was leader of the House of Bëor, the first men to travel into\n    Beleriand. He met Finrod Felagund, who guided them to settle in\n    Estolad, east of Doriath. Bëor took service with Finrod in\n    Nargothrond. His name _Bëor_ meant _vassal_ in the Bëorian tongue.\n    He got his title, _the Old_, because he died at 93 years of age, of\n    which 44 were spent serving Finrod.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BARAN was the eldest son of Bëor the Old and took up the leadership\n    of the House of Bëor when his father departed to Nargothrond. He\n    dwelt in Estolad and had two sons, BORON and BARANOR.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BEREG, a grandson of Baran, was dissatisfied with Estolad, and led\n    part of the people away to parts unknown, disappearing from the\n    histories. It is possible some of his descendants were the ancestors\n    of the later Men of Eriador.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BOROMIR was a son of Boron. The later Boromir of Gondor was named\n    after him. Boromir was granted the land of Ladros in Dorthonion as a\n    fief, and his house removed there.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BREGOR was a son of Boromir and Andreth was Boromir's daughter.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BREGOLAS, who died in the Dagor Bragollach, and BARAHIR were sons of\n    Bregor.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BEREN was a son of Barahir, perhaps the greatest hero of the First\n    Age. He and Luthíen went to Morgoth and successfully cut a Silmaril\n    from his crown.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BARAGUND was a son of Bregolas and a direct descendant of Bëor the\n    Old. He had one daughter, Morwen, and he was the grandfather of\n    Túrin Turambar. He survived the Dagor Bragollach and lived as an\n    outlaw with his uncle Barahir and some companions.

Green trees with\nscented flowers, singing birds, eagles, and sailing ships were all\neffects created through Gandalf's work with colored smokes and lights.\nThe finale was a large red-gold dragon that flew out of a mountain,\nbreathing fire and circling over the Hobbits' heads, before exploding\nover Bywater. This was in honor of Bilbo's adventures in _The Hobbit_\nand was also the signal for supper.\n\n\n\nThe meals were lunch, tea, and dinner/supper. There was a special family\ndinner party under a large pavilion. Guests at the special supper were\nprimarily relatives of Bilbo and Frodo and a few special friends; only\n144 people were invited, one gross, the sum of the ages of both Bilbo\nand Frodo, as of that day. At the end of the dinner feast, Bilbo made a\nspeech, slipped on the One Ring, and vanished, shocking the 144 Hobbits\nin attendance.\n\nAfter the party was over, hobbits came in carriages to drive away the\nimportant people and the Gardners came to drive away others who stayed\nbehind for some reason. Acting on orders, hobbits came the next morning\nto clear away all the party preparations (pavilions, tables, chairs\netc..) and the mess left on the ground by the all the party goers."

Durin was set to sleep alone\nbeneath Mount Gundabad in Middle-earth until the Elves awoke. The name\nDurin, like other names of Tolkien's Dwarves, was taken from Old Norse.\nIn Tolkien's fiction, Dalish (the language of Dale) had the same\nrelationship to Rohirric and Westron as Old Norse has to English, so\nsince Westron was rendered in English, the language of Dale was rendered\nin Old Norse. The Dwarvish names were in the language of Dale, which\ntherefore was rendered in Old Norse in _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the\nRings._\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien took Durin's name, as with most other dwarf names in his\nwork, from real Norse mythology (in which _Durin_ was the name of the\nfirst of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves and the forger of many\nwonderful items).\n\nUpon his awakening at Mount Gundabad in the Years of the Trees, he\ntraveled until he came upon the Mirrormere, the lake that the Dwarves\ncall _Kheled-zâram_. He created there a great city within the Misty\nMountains. This was Khazad-dûm, known by Elves as _Moria_.\n\nAccording to the Dwarves, Durin awoke at Mount Gundabad in the north of\nthe Misty Mountains, which remained a sacred place to them ever after.\nDurin and his heirs were revered by all Dwarves, and not just those of\nhis own line.\n\nDurin founded the line of Dwarves called Durin's Folk. Durin was called\nthe Deathless because he lived far longer than any other known dwarf. It\nwas also believed that Durin would be reincarnated a total of six times,\neach time as a descendant of an older Durin.\n\nLater, while passing through Moria with the Fellowship, Gimli sang a\npoem about Durin."

The selection contains 354 letters dates between\nOctober 1914 when Tolkien was an undergraduate at Oxford and August 29\n1973 four days before his death.\n\nThe book is now published by George Allen and Unwin (UK) and Houghton\nMifflin (US).\n\n\nFormation of the Book\n\nHumphrey Carpenter first collected and transcribed all the letters and\nmade the initial selection based upon that. Then Christopher Tolkien\ncommented upon his work and made various suggestions for changes, which\nwhere then discussed among them and adopted with various emendations.\nThey then found it necessary to reduce the text quite severely for\nconsideration of space. Humphrey then proposed the initial cuts on which\nChristopher again made various suggestions after which they came up with\na final procedure which was needed in order to make this collection\nhappen. The collection of letters therefore reflects Humphrey tastes and\njudgement more then that of Christopher. Even though it is still their\njoined work.\n\n\nContents of the Collection\n\n-   Introduction\n-   Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien\n-   Notes\n-   Index\n\n\nTypes of Letters\n\nThe 354 letters can be roughly divided into four categories:\n\n-   Personal letters to his family, namely to his wife Edith Tolkien,\n    his son Christopher Tolkien and all his other children and even some\n    grandchildren.\n-   Letters concerning his career as a professor of Anglo-Saxon\n-   Letters send to his publishers Allen & Unwin explaining his often\n    continued failing to meet deadlines and other topics related to\n    publishing a book and\n-   Letters about Middle-earth, this category is for obvious reasons the\n    most interesting to Tolkien fans as it provides a lot of information\n    about Middle-earth which at the time of publishing could not\n    anywhere else in the then published works by Tolkien himself and his\n    then posthumously published work by his son Christopher.\n\nInteresting examples\n\nIn letters 29 & 30, we find out that a German translation of _The\nHobbit_ was being negotiated in 1938. The German firm inquired whether\nTolkien was of 'arisch' (Aryan) origin. Tolkien was infuriated by this,\nand wrote two letters as a response. In the first one Tolkien apparently\nrefused to give any declaration whatsoever of his origin and in the\nsecond one he proudly protested on the inquiry and, among other things,\nreplied that “... I regret that I appear to have _no_ ancestors of that\ngifted  people”. He gave his editor the choice on which reply to\nuse. This second letter is the only one preserved and it is probable\nthat the first one was sent."

    "text": "HUORNS were the dreadful,\nliving race of ancient, slow-moving trees, whom the Ents cared for and\ntended to in the Second and Third Ages.\n\nIn Middle-earth, they were known to dwell in the Old Forest and in\nFangorn Forest.\n\n\nHistory and Origin\n\nAmong the most ancient of the Olvar that lived within Arda were the\ntrees of the Great Forests that came from the seeds that Yavanna devised\nduring the Age of the Lamps. For many ages they grew peacefully, but in\nMiddle-earth at the beginning of the Ages of the Stars there came among\nthe trees great spirits later known as Ents. These protectors appeared\nbecause many other races in that time came into the world and Yavanna\nfeared that the forests would be destroyed. So through the Ages of the\nStars and Sun, the Ents walked the forests, and in time it is said some\nEnts became more tree-like and the ancient trees became more Ent-like\nand limb-lithe. Like Ents, they learned the Art of Speech. Whether tree\nor Ent in the beginning, by the Third Age of the Sun they were a race\napart, referred to as _Huorns_.\n\nThe Huorns mostly stood as dark trees in the deepest forests, gnarled\nand unmoving, yet watchful. When aroused in wrath they moved swiftly as\nif wrapped in shadows, falling on foes with deadly and merciless\nstrength.\n\nThe tale of the War of the Ring tells of how, with the Ents, the Huorns\nmarched on Isengard like a great forest, and how, under the direction of\nthe Ents, they exterminated the entire Orc legion in the Battle of the\nHornburg.\n\nHuorns were ancient and long-brooding, and some were said to be\nblack-hearted and rotten. At least one such sentient tree spirit\ninhabited the Old Forest by the banks of the Withywindle River, who was\ncalled Old Man Willow. As the Old Forest and Fangorn were the last\nremnants of the most ancient forests in Middle-earth, Old Man Willow\nwished to prevent further inroads into his realm. He held all the Old\nForest in an enchantment by the power of his song and led all travellers\nto him, where with his limb-lithe roots and branches he consumed them.\n\nIn _The Two Towers,_ the Huorns are witnessed to march to Isengard with\nthe Ents. After Isengard is harrowed of its orcs, most of the Huorns\nchased and killed them after the Battle of the Hornburg. After this\nbrief appearance, the Huorns went back into the forests. The tactics\nused by the Huorns were quite effective, as they only attacked when all\nthe enemy Orcs would be in their midst, denying the orcs chance of\nescape. It is notable that Huorns seemed to have the ability to cloak\nthemselves in shadows, becoming almost undetectable at night.",

The Doom of Mandos was placed on them so that\nthey could not return to Valinor.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Exiles were split into two groups during the Kinslaying at\nAlqualondë; Fëanor and his sons and followers took the ships they had\nacquired from the Teleri, leaving Fingolfin's followers behind. They had\nto cross the Helcaraxë in the north, and lost a large number of people\nthere. When asked about the course of action they would take to\ntransport the rest of the exiles, Fëanor ordered the burning of the\nships.\n\nMorgoth wasted no time attacking the exiles, which were vastly superior\nto them in spite of their small number and unprepared state. Fingolfin\nand his followers arrived at the same time as the Moon first rose, and\nthey mainly settled in Hithlum.\n\nThe Exiles set up kingdoms in various places and joined others. Amrod\nand Amras joined the Laiquendi of Ossiriand, Finrod built Nargothrond\nand Minas Tirith, and Turgon built Gondolin.\n\nFor hundreds of years, the Ñoldor held off the forces of Morgoth,\ndefeating him in three of the major battle of Beleriand and laying siege\nto his great abode in the north. However, in FA 455 Morgoth broke the\nsiege, and the Ñoldor began losing ground. About seventeen years later\nthey lost a critical battle and many subsequently enslaved.\n\nThe majority of the survivors were forced to relocate farther into the\nsouth with further hurt coming to them by infighting between them caused\nby the Sons of Fëanor. Eventually, all the great realms occupied by the\nexiles fell by the year FA 510 with all survivors fleeing to the Havens\nof Sirion, which had became their chief colony. More conflict assailed\nthem when again the Sons of Fëanor attacked and killed many of their\nkin. One of their residents raised there was Eärendil who built Vingilot\nallowing him to escape the carnage. Joined by his wife, they both won\nthrough to Valinor by the light of the Silmaril. There they pleaded with\nthe Valar for aid and forgiveness for the rebellion of the Ñoldor.\n\nAfter the Morgoth was defeated in the War of Wrath, the Doom was lifted\nand many of the Ñoldorin Exiles went back to the Undying Lands save for\nGaladriel and the Ñoldor who followed Celebrimbor."

    "text": "The SUNDERING OF THE ELVES refers to the separation of the Elves from\ntheir original roots in Cuiviénen. In J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium,\nthe Elves are a sundered people. They awoke at Cuiviénen on the\ncontinent of Middle-earth (see: Awakening of the Elves), where they were\ndivided into three tribes: the Minyar (Vanyar), the Tatyar (Ñoldor), and\nthe Nelyar (Teleri). After some time, they were summoned by Oromë to\nlive with the Valar in Aman. That summons and the Great Journey that\nfollowed split the Elves into two main groups (and many minor ones), who\nwere never fully reunited.\n\nThe name QUENDI refers to _all_ elves.\n\n\nHistory\n\nAvari\n\nThe AVARI are _Those who Refused the Summons_ of Oromë, or simply _The\nUnwilling_. (Most of the Avari came from the largest tribe, the Teleri.\nA few of the Ñoldor remained as well, but were no longer called by that\ntribal name.) Together with the Nandor and the Sindar, they are called\nthe MORIQUENDI (_Elves of Darkness_) in recognition of the fact that\nthey did not see the light of the Two Trees. While all of the Eldar\ndeparted Middle-earth by the early Fourth Age, it appears that the Avari\nmostly stayed.\n\nEldar\n\nThe ELDAR are those who accepted the summons. Their name, literally\n_Star People_, was given to them by Oromë in their own language. Those\nof the Lindar who undertook the Great Journey were called the Teleri.\n\n-   Those of the Teleri who refused to cross the Misty Mountains, and\n    stayed in the valley of Anduin, are called the NANDOR (_Valley\n    People_).\n    -   Those of the Nandor who left the Anduin under the leadership of\n        Denethor and came to Beleriand are called the LAIQUENDI (_Green\n        Elves_).\n    -   The other Nandor became known as the SILVAN ELVES, living in the\n        forests of Wilderland. Some of the Avari joined them there.\n-   Those of the Teleri who reached Beleriand by the Great Sea but chose\n    not to cross to Aman were called the SINDAR (_Grey People_).\n    -   Many of the Teleri chose to remain behind in order to look for\n        their lord Thingol, who disappeared near the end of the journey.\n        These were known as the EGLATH (_Forsaken_), because they were\n        left behind when their kindred crossed the Sea.\n    -   Those of the Teleri who came to the shores of the Great Sea but\n        decided to stay there are called the FALATHRIM (_People of the\n        Shore_).\n-   The Vanyar, the Ñoldor, and those of the Teleri who stayed with them\n    to the end are called the CALAQUENDI (_Elves of Light_) because they\n    saw the Two Trees. The rest of the Teleri are also sometimes counted\n    among the Moriquendi.\n    -   Most of the Ñoldor returned with Fëanor to Middle-earth, and at\n        least some of these remained there through the Third Age. These\n        became known as the EXILES.\n    -   Those Ñoldor that remained behind or returned under Finarfin\n        became known as the AULENDUR (_Servants of Aulë_)."

From\nthere it leads into Dunland, arching slightly towards the Fords of Isen.\nAfter it crosses the Isen it is called the GREAT WEST ROAD, and runs\nalong the Ered Nimrais through Anórien, then goes south past Minas\nTirith and Osgiliath as the SOUTH ROAD and ends at Pelargir.\n\nOther roads which meet up with it are the King's Highway from Minas\nTirith past Osgiliath to Minas Ithil, and at Pelargir the road which\neventually ends at Erech as well as the HARAD ROAD which leads into\nSouth Harad.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Greenway was long the main path of traffic between Gondor and Arnor,\nbut in the later Third Age after the division of Arnor in three realms\nit became less used. The use of the road virtually ended after the Great\nPlague and Long Winter when Tharbad was abandoned and its bridge ruined,\nand the road in Dunland was mostly lost.\n\nBoromir took this road, crossing Tharbad but losing his horse, on his\nway to Rivendell.

    "title": "Rangers of the North",
    "page_id": "2269",
    "text": "RANGERS OF THE NORTH, or simply THE RANGERS, were the northern\nwandering people of Eriador, the last remnant of the Dúnedain of Arnor,\nwho had once peopled the North Kingdom of Arnor. They protected the\nlands they wandered although their secretiveness made other peoples\nconsider them dangerous and distrustful in Bree and the Shire, where\nthey were known as “Watchers”.\n\nThey were grim in appearance and were usually dressed in grey or dark\ngreen, with a cloak-clasp shaped like a 6-pointed star.\n\nThe term 'Rangers of the North' was used most often by those who lived\nin the southern lands of Rohan and Gondor, perhaps to distinguish this\npeople from their distant cousins, the Rangers of Ithilien. Like the\nRangers of the North, these were also Dúnedain, but they belonged to the\nSouth-kingdom of Gondor, and their ancestors had been divided from the\nNorthern Dúnedain for some three thousand years.\n\n\nBackground\n\n The Dúnedain of\nArnor dwindled after the breaking of Arnor into three kingdoms and the\nwars with Angmar. Cardolan and Rhudaur soon fell and only the\npetty-kingdom of Arthedain maintained the noble line of Isildur.\nFinally, that too was destroyed in the Battle of Fornost and Arvedui,\nthe last King of Arthedain was lost in the sea.\n\nArvedui's son and heir, Aranarth claimed the title of the Chieftain, who\nwould rule the remnants of his people. Elrond had in his keeping the\nheirlooms of the house of Isildur: the shards of Narsil, the Star of\nElendil, the Sceptre of Annúminas and later the Ring of Barahir,\nransomed from the Lossoth.\n\nEach of Aranarth's heirs (who, like him, could trace his descent back to\nIsildur himself) would be secretly born and raised in Rivendell.\n\nThe Rangers became a secretive wandering and nomadic people around\nEriador, far from Sauron's spies, little known or remembered, and their\ndeeds were seldom recorded.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Watchful Peace followed the loss of Arnor and after its end, the\nenemies concentrated mostly against Rhovanion and Gondor. During that\ntime, the Rangers fought minor battles and skirmishes against orcs and\nwolves in order to keep the region safe. The hobbits of the Shire\nflourished under their protection.\n\nDuring the rule of Arassuil, the Orcs of the Misty Mountains became more\nbold, daring to invade Eriador. The Rangers fought many battles trying\nto hold them back, but one party managed to reach the Shire, and were\nfought off by a party of brave Hobbits under Bandobras Took in T.A.\n2747. Soon after, the Long Winter arrived and many lives were lost, and\nGandalf and the Rangers had to help the Hobbits of the Shire survive.\n\nIn 2911, during Argonui's rule, the Fell Winter began with the\nBrandywine freezing over. This was a catalyst for White Wolves invading\nEriador from the North which must have harassed the Rangers. In the last\nyear of his reign, great floods devastated Enedwaith and Minhiriath\nleaving Tharbad ruined and deserted. The following years were peaceful\nalthough Arador was killed by hill-trolls and his son Arathorn II was\nkilled while hunting orcs.\n\nArathorn's son, Aragorn II succeeded him, who between 2957 to 2980 took\ngreat journeys, serving in the armies of King Thengel of Rohan, and\nSteward Ecthelion II of Gondor. Many of his tasks weakened Sauron and\nhis allies, and the West endured him during the War of the Ring.\n\nAt that time Aragorn's Rangers were scattered and diminished. When\nHalbarad led a troop of the Rangers into the south to Aragorn's aid in\nthe War, in haste he could muster no more than thirty in this company\nwho fought in the Battle of Pelennor Fields.\n\nAragorn eventually became King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom and the\nRangers became once more a united people under the line of Elendil in\nthe Fourth Age.\n\nFor over a thousand years, the Rangers of the North faithfully preserved\nthe Line of Elendil and the ways of the Dúnedain and the ancient\nheirlooms of the Heir of Isildur such as the Shards of Narsil, Star of\nElendil, Sceptre of Annúminas, and the Ring of Barahir. Like all\nDúnedain, they were very friendly with the Elves, particularly those of\nRivendell, where each heir would be born and raised. They secretly\nguarded and protected Eriador, from spies and invaders, brigands, and\nother worse foes.\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring, the Rangers of the North were led by\nAragorn, future king of the reunited kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor. But\ndespite Aragorn's leadership, most of the Rangers remained scattered and\ndiminished. Therefore, when the ranger Halbarad endeavored to aid\nAragorn in the War, he could muster only a small number of Rangers to\njoin him."

As Tolkien did not\nfinish it, the collection was completed by his son Christopher with\nassistance of the young Guy Gavriel Kay. The title _Quenta Silmarillion_\nis translated as “the Tale of the Silmarils”. The QUENTA SILMARILLION is\nthe third part of the _The Silmarillion._\n\n_Quenta Silmarillion_ is the largest final-rendition account of the\nFirst Age, and its stories narrate all of that Age's major events.\n\n\nContents\n\n-   Of the Beginning of Days\n-   Of Aulë and Yavanna\n-   Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\n-   Of Thingol and Melian\n-   Of Eldamar and the Princes of the Eldalië\n-   Of Fëanor and the Unchaining of Melkor\n-   Of the Silmarils and the Unrest of the Noldor\n-   Of the Darkening of Valinor\n-   Of the Flight of the Noldor\n-   Of the Sindar\n-   Of the Sun and Moon and the Hiding of Valinor\n-   Of Men\n-   Of the Return of the Noldor\n-   Of Beleriand and its Realms\n-   Of the Noldor in Beleriand\n-   Of Maeglin\n-   Of the Coming of Men into the West\n-   Of the Ruin of Beleriand and the Fall of Fingolfin\n-   Of Beren and Lúthien\n-   Of the Fifth Battle: Nirnaeth Arnoediad\n-   Of Túrin Turambar\n-   Of the Ruin of Doriath\n-   Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin\n-   Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nTolkien envisaged _The Silmarillion_ as deriving from a manuscript\nwritten by an Eriol or Ælfwine of England; an imaginary Dark Age source\nfor the material, which itself contains little or no reference to the\npeople or events of the Second or Third Ages of his legendarium.\nOriginated from Elvish legends, in some parts it presents Elves as long\ngone, which hints that its final form was edited during the Fourth Age\nby Hobbits and/or Men.\n\nIt tells about the history of Arda (the Earth), after its creation by\nEru Ilúvatar. The Valar, angelic beings, enter into the world and try to\nshape it after a vision given to them by Eru. The initial shape of Arda,\nchosen by the Valar, was of a symmetrical continent lit by the Two\nLamps. However, the lamps were destroyed by the vicious Melkor; Arda was\ndarkened, and the lamps' fall spoiled the symmetry of Arda's surface.\nTwo main continents were created that are of concern to the story: Aman\nin the west, and Middle-earth in the east.\n\nFollowing this, Melkor hid himself from the Valar in his fortress Utumno\nin the north of Middle-earth. He also surrounded himself with horrible\nbeasts, many of them Maia in the form of fell animals, known as Balrogs.\n\nThe Valar moved to the western continent Aman where they established the\nrealm Valinor of which Manwë was made king. The Vala Yavanna created the\nTwo Trees which illuminated Valinor. Middle-earth, by contrast, was in\nperpetual darkness, and was seldom visited by the Valar. Only some of\nthem, most notably Oromë, visited it periodically, especially to prepare\nfor the coming of the Elves, which the Valar had foreseen in their\nvision and to keep an eye on Melkor's activities.\n\nIntroduction of the Elves\n\nOn one of his expeditions Oromë discovered the newly-awakened Elves at\nCuiviénen. The Valar, aware of the risk Melkor posed to the Elves,\nbeleaguered his fortress and finally overthrew him and took him prisoner\nto Valinor to serve “three ages” in the Halls of Mandos.\n\nOromë was then sent to the Elves again, to invite them to come with him\nto Aman and live there. Some of the Elves did not follow him or became\nsidetracked and stayed in Middle-earth, and so the Elves became\nsundered. These notably included the Sindar, who stayed in Middle-earth\nwhen their king, Thingol, became lost in the forest. He was to later\nemerge, married to the Maia Melian, and found the Kingdom of Doriath.\n\nThe Elves who accepted the summons were carried across the sea on a\nfloating island.\n\nThe Noldor and Melkor\n\nFinwë, the first High King of the Ñoldor, had a son Fëanor. At his birth\nFëanor drew so much life from his mother Míriel that she grew weary of\nlife and her spirit left her bodily form, departing to the halls of\nMandos. Eventually, Finwë married Indis and had two further sons,\nFingolfin and Finarfin. Fëanor became the most famous Elven craftsman,\nespecially by making the Silmarils, three jewels in which he trapped the\nlight of the Two Trees. The Silmarils were hallowed by Varda, and would\nburn any evil or mortal creature who touched them.\n\nAbout this time, Melkor, having completed his sentence, convinced the\nother Valar that he had reformed and he was released. By various lies he\nmanaged to play Fëanor and Fingolfin against each other, creating strife\nand division amongst the Noldor; furthermore, he convinced the Ñoldor\nthat they had been brought to Aman primarily so the Valar could keep\nthem under control. Finally, Fëanor rebelled against the Valar, publicly\nadvocating leaving and then drawing his weapon against Fingolfin.\n\nThe Valar were soon aware of Melkor's ultimate responsibility in this.\nTulkas hunted him, but Melkor had hidden and could not be found. Because\nhe threatened Fingolfin's life, Fëanor was exiled from Tirion for twelve\nyears. With his seven sons and his father Finwë he moved to a\nnewly-built stronghold, Formenos.\n\nCoveting the Silmarils, Melkor went to Formenos, hoping to trick Fëanor\nand gain possession of them, but Fëanor saw through his ruse and\ndismissed him with contempt. Melkor then traveled to Avathar in secret,\nwhere he joined forces with the evil spirit Ungoliant, whose form was a\ngiant spider-like creature. Melkor swore an oath to give Ungoliant\nwhatever she desired, and imparted some of his power to her. With her\nhelp, they traveled into Valinor secretly, where Ungoliant's poison\nkilled the Two Trees. Covered by an impenetrable blackness, Melkor and\nUngoliant then traveled to Formenos, assassinated Finwë and stole the\nSilmarils, before escaping in the confusion.\n\nMelkor and Ungoliant then made their way across to Middle-earth, and he\ngave Ungoliant all the great jewels he had stolen, except the Silmarils,\nwhich he desired to keep. The rapacious Ungoliant consumed them all and,\nstill hungry, she demanded the Silmarils, but the ever-treacherous\nMelkor reneged on his oath, so she seized him and bound him with her\nwebs, and his anguished cries echoed across all of Middle-earth.\n\nMelkor escaped from Ungoliant with the help of his former servants, the\nBalrogs, who came to his aid from their hiding places in the deepest\nrecesses of the ruins of Utumno, and he re-established his empire in the\nNorth from his secondary fortress of Angband. He placed the three\nSilmarils, which now were the only source of the unmarred light of the\nTwo Trees, in his Iron Crown, although his hands were burned black by\nthem.\n\nFëanor was furious at the death of his father and the theft of the\nSilmarils. Travelling to Tirion in violation of his exile, he publicly\nblamed both Melkor, whom he named Morgoth, and the Valar (for failing to\nprotect Finwë and the Silmarils). He urged the Noldor to leave Valinor,\nfor a punitive expedition against Morgoth and a new life in\nMiddle-earth. He and his sons then swore the notorious Oath of Fëanor,\nvowing to pursue with hatred anyone who withheld a Silmaril from them.\n\nDeparture of the Noldor and assault on Doriath\n\nInflamed by the passionate urging of Fëanor, most of the assembled\nÑoldor left Tirion, and traveled to Alqualondë, attempting to persuade\nthe Teleri to join them, or at least to lend them ships to cross the\nGreat Sea. When the Teleri refused, Fëanor ordered that the swan-ships\nbe taken by force; the notorious Kinslaying ensued, in which many Teleri\nwere slaughtered. Shortly afterwards, at the northern boundary of\nEldamar, the Noldor encountered Mandos, who cursed all the Ñoldor who\nleft with Fëanor .\n\nAt this point, Finarfin, who had always been reluctant to leave, turned\nback to Valinor with a small number of followers. Many ships had been\nlost by this time and not all the Ñoldor could cross to Middle-earth, so\nFëanor and his sons seized the remaining swan-ships, abandoning\nFingolfin and his followers (including Galadriel), who were obliged to\nmake their way to Middle-earth across the terrible ice wastes of the\nHelcaraxë. Approximately 2.2 million Noldor are said to have perished on\nthe Helcaraxë.\n\nMeanwhile, Morgoth attempted to conquer Doriath, the realm of Thingol\nand Melian in Middle-earth. In the first of five great Battles, he sent\nout two armies of Orcs, forcing Thingol and his Maia queen to establish\na magical boundary around Doriath, the “Girdle of Melian”, while the\ncoastal Elves were forced to retreat into their fortified harbour towns.\nBy luck, Fëanor and his host arrived at the height of this conflict and\nthe combined forces of the Ñoldor and the Sindar utterly defeated the\nOrc armies in the second Battle, Dagor-nuin-Giliath (Battle under the\nStars). However Fëanor, in his fury, chased after the retreating Orcs\nand he was ambushed and killed by Balrogs.\n\nThe Sun and the Moon, the Long Peace and the Coming of Men\n\nThe grieving Valar could not revive the Two Trees,because Fëanor would\nnot give up the silmarills which captured the light of the trees. But\nthey were able to create the Moon and the Sun from a silver leaf and a\ngolden fruit, which were all that remained of them. These new lights\nilluminated Middle-earth, stimulated much new plant and animal growth,\nand for a while, confounded the plans of Morgoth. Unable to assail them,\nas his once near-limitless power grew ever more dispersed among his\nservants, who feared the new lights no less than he, the Dark Lord was\nforced to take refuge in clouds and shadow that surrounded his\nstrongholds. In this era, Men, the younger Children of Ilúvatar, awoke\nin eastern Middle-earth, and some began to migrate westward.\n\nThe Ñoldor established kingdoms and principalities in northern and\ncentral Beleriand, which were ruled by the descendants of Fëanor,\nFingolfin and Finarfin. They built many great strongholds, including the\nvast cavern-city of Nargothrond, on the river Narog, and the mighty\nhidden mountain fortress of Gondolin, ruled by Turgon, from whence none\nwho entered were permitted to leave. Many of the Sindar, the native\nElves of Beleriand, were absorbed into the Ñoldorin kingdoms. Others\nwere in Sindarin states: Thingol's kingdom in Doriath, the coastal Falas\nruled by Círdan the shipwright, and the secretive Green-Elves of\nOssiriand.\n\nRelations between the Ñoldor and the independent Sindar were at first\namicable but they later deteriorated. The Ñoldor had long hidden the\ntruth about the Kinslaying and the Curse from Thingol, but he eventually\nlearned of it from Angrod. As a result he banned all the Ñoldor (except\nhis kin in the house of Finarfin) from entering Doriath, decreeing also\nthat the Noldorin tongue could no longer be spoken within his realm.\n\nA further rift between the Ñoldor and the Sindar, which was to have\nfar-reaching consequences, was caused by the actions of Aredhel,\ndaughter of Fingolfin and sister of Turgon. Tiring of her long\nconfinement in Gondolin, she rode east to seek out her old friends, the\nsons of Fëanor, but she was barred from crossing through Doriath by the\ndecree of Thingol. Forced to skirt along the edge of the dreaded region\nof Nan Dungortheb (where Ungoliant had gone after the escape of\nMorgoth), Aredhel was separated from her escort and lost. She was\neventually found by Eöl, the Dark Elf, a kinsman of Thingol who lived\nalone in the dark forest of Nan Elmoth. He took her as his wife, and\nthey had a son, Maeglin. Eöl often traveled east to deal with the\nDwarves of the Blue Mountains, and he acquired great skill in metalwork\nfrom them, which he imparted to his son. He refused to let his wife and\nchild leave his domain, but Aredhel determined to return to Gondolin\nwith her son, so they waited until Eöl left for the east and then made\ntheir escape.\n\nEöl pursued them to Gondolin, where he was captured and brought before\nTurgon. Eöl demanded that Maeglin should leave with him, or be cursed,\nbut Maeglin renounced his father. Turgon then decreed that Eöl must\neither remain in Gondolin or die. The next day, when he was again\nbrought before Turgon, Eöl tried to kill Maeglin with a poisoned lance,\nbut Aredhel stepped between them; struck in the shoulder, she died that\nnight. As punishment, Turgon had Eöl thrown to his death from the walls\nof the fortress. Maeglin remained in Gondolin, became a mighty warrior\nand wrought many great weapons, but his forbidden love for his cousin\nIdril Celebrindal would eventually cause him to betray Gondolin to\nMorgoth.\n\nAfter fifty years, and believing the Noldor to be unprepared for war,\nMorgoth again attacked the from the north, but Fingolfin and Maedhros\nwere ready for him and they defeated Morgoth's forces in the third\nBattle, called Dagor Aglareb, pursuing the Orcs to the very gates of\nAngband and destroying them utterly. They then laid the Siege of\nAngband, which lasted for four hundred years.\n\nAlmost one hundred years after the Dagor Aglareb, Morgoth's forces tried\nto attack the realm of Hithlum by stealing in from the far north-west,\nbut were intercepted and defeated by Fingon. After a further hundred\nyears, Morgoth sent forth the dragon Glaurung, the first of the\nFire-drakes. Being only half-grown and not fully armoured, Glaurung was\nunable to withstand Fingon and his archers, eventually fleeing back to\nAngband. The period after the first defeat of Glaurung became known as\nThe Long Peace, lasting almost two hundred years.\n\nIt was during this time, about three hundred years after the Noldor had\narrived in Beleriand, that Men first came into Middle-earth from the\nregions far to the east. They first appeared in Ossiriand, where\nFelagund was the first of the Noldor to see them. Over the next hundred\nyears many of them became allies of the Noldor in the war against\nMorgoth, and settled in Noldorin realms.\n\nThe Dagor Bragollach\n\nMorgoth, however, merely used the Siege as an opportunity to build up\nstrength, and in , renewed the war on his own terms. The fourth Great\nBattle, Dagor Bragollach became famous for the re-emergence of the\nDragon Glaurung in his full strength. Morgoth's armies overthrew the\nSiege, slaying many of the Noldor, with Glaurung laying waste to\nArd-galen and Dorthonion.\n\nEnraged by the assaults against his people, Fingolfin fearlessly made\nhis way alone to the gates of Angband, where he challenged Morgoth to\nsingle combat and the evil Vala was forced to come out and meet him\nrather than appear cowardly. In the ensuing battle Fingolfin wounded\nMorgoth seven times, but eventually stumbled and fell among the great\npits created by Morgoth's hammer, Grond. Morgoth beat Fingolfin to the\nground three times with his great shield, and then crushed Fingolfin\nunder his foot, but with his dying strength Fingolfin slashed Morgoth's\nfoot, maiming him.\n\nMorgoth broke Fingolfin's body and was about to throw the remains to his\nwolves, but Thorondor, the gigantic king of the eagles, had been\nwatching the battle from afar and at that moment flew down to rescue the\nbody. The giant eagle gouged Morgoth's face with his talons, seized\nFingolfin's body and carried it back to Gondolin for burial. After that\ntime Morgoth's seven wounds never healed, he became lame in his left\nfoot, where Fingolfin had hewn it, and his face forever bore the scars\nof Thorondor's talons.\n\nSixteen years later, Maedhros led the northern Ñoldor and their allies\namong Men in a final desperate attempt to defeat Morgoth. In this\nclimactic battle — which is named Nirnaeth Arnoediad— the forces of the\nÑoldor attacked Angband and briefly broke through the gates, only to be\nbeaten back when Morgoth unleashed his full forces, now vastly\noutnumbering those of Elves and Men. Led by the terrible dragon\nGlaurung, Morgoth's forces crushed the armies of the Ñoldor, and many of\nthe elf lords were killed or captured, leaving Morgoth master of the\nentire North. Afterwards, he set about destroying the remaining\nElf-kingdoms one by one.\n\nThe Dagor Bragollach was the battle in which Gil-galad left Hithlum for\nthe Havens of the Falas.\n\nBeren and Lúthien\n\nThe later parts of the _Quenta Silmarillion_ include two stories dealing\nwith individuals and with the relations between Men and Elves.\n\nThe tragic yet heroic story of Beren and Lúthien (which has similarities\nto the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice) tells of the love between the Man\nBeren and Lúthien, daughter of Thingol and Melian and the most beautiful\nof all Elf Maidens. Thingol, disliking mortal Men and determined to\nprevent their marriage, declares that he will consent only if Beren\nbrings Thingol a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown. Thus, in sending Beren\non this perilous quest, Thingol unwittingly binds himself to the Doom of\nMandos, ensuring his eventual downfall.\n\nTravelling to the mountains of Thangorodrim in disguise, Beren and\nLúthien succeed in making their way into Angband and to the very foot of\nMorgoth's throne. There Lúthien reveals herself, but her beauty and\ncharm enable her to briefly overcome the evil lord and she casts a spell\nthat puts Morgoth and his minions to sleep. Beren then cuts one of the\nSilmarils from Morgoth's iron crown, but when he attempts to take a\nsecond Silmaril his knife snaps and a shard flies off; it cuts Morgoth's\nface, and he begins to stir.\n\nAs they leave, Morgoth and his creatures reawaken and Beren and Lúthien\nare confronted by Carcharoth, the giant Wolf that guards the gate of\nAngband. Beren attempts to hold off the terrible creature with the power\nof the Silmaril, but Carcharoth bites off his hand and swallows the holy\njewel. Driven mad by the pain it inflicts, the creature goes on a\nrampage through Doriath until it is eventually killed by the mighty\nElf-hound Huan. In this final battle Beren is fatally wounded by\nCarcharoth, so Lúthien travels in spirit to the Houses of the Dead, to\nplead with Mandos for Beren's release. She and Beren are sent back to\nMiddle-earth alive, but Lúthien becomes a mortal woman, so that in time\nthey will both die and leave the Universe together. As immortals whose\nsouls are bound to Arda for as long as it lasts, Thingol and Melian\nsuffer the grief of being deprived of their daughter for all time.\n\nTúrin Turambar\n\n_Main article: Túrin Turambar_\n\n_See also: The Children of Húrin_\n\nAlso included is the story of Túrin Turambar. His father Húrin is\ncaptured at the end of the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, and for his\ndefiance, Morgoth places a curse on his family. Túrin becomes a great\nhero, but due partly to his hot temper and partly to a string of bad\nluck (in fact, the working of Morgoth's demonic will), whatever he turns\nhis hand to seems to go wrong, and death and grief haunt those around\nhim. Making matters worse, both Túrin and his sister Niënor are\nenchanted by the mighty dragon Glaurung — who has sacked the great\nElf-city of Nargothrond and taken up residence there — and they fall in\nlove and live for time as man and wife. Eventually Túrin kills Glaurung,\nbut with his death the spell is lifted. Driven mad by the realisation of\ntheir sins, Túrin and Nienor both commit suicide.\n\nGondolin\n\nThe last Elf-Kingdom to fall was the hidden city of Gondolin. Tuor, a\nmortal man, was sent by Ulmo as a messenger to Gondolin, to warn King\nTurgon of the city's impending destruction. Remaining in Gondolin, Tuor\nmarried Turgon's daughter, Idril, and they had a son Eärendil. Gondolin\nwas eventually betrayed to Morgoth by Maeglin, and destroyed. Turgon\nfell during the battle and the High Kingship passed to Gil-galad, who\ndwelt at the Mouth of Sirion. Tuor, Idril and Eärendil escaped, together\nwith a number of refugees.\n\nGrowing up, Eärendil married Elwing, granddaughter of Beren and Lúthien\nand current keeper of the Silmaril they took from Morgoth. With the help\nof the Silmaril, Eärendil and Elwing sailed to Valinor to plead with the\nValar, asking them to pardon the Noldor and assist Elves and Men in\ntheir need. The Valar agreed to this request, and set Eärendil, with the\nSilmaril, to sail the skies as a star until the ending of the world.\n\nBattle between Morgoth and the Host of the Valar\n\nThe Host of the Valar, led by Eönwë, finally attacked Morgoth in\nAngband. In this battle, the Great Battle (also known as the War of\nWrath), Morgoth was utterly defeated; his armies were destroyed, with\nonly a few remnants scattered across the Earth. He was taken prisoner\nand his two remaining Silmarils were confiscated. Maedhros and Maglor,\nFëanor's two surviving sons, stole the Silmarils from Eönwë, but they\nfound the Silmarils would not tolerate their touch, instead tormenting\nthem with burning pain. Maedhros committed suicide by jumping with the\nSilmaril into a chasm in the earth, and Maglor threw his Silmaril away\ninto the sea.\n\nThe Valar pardoned the Ñoldor for their rebellion, and the Teleri\noffered forgiveness for the Kinslaying. Many of the Ñoldor and the\nSindar left Middle-earth and traveled into the West, to live in Valinor.\nMany more followed Gil-galad and stayed in Middle-earth. Morgoth was\ncast out of the World, imprisoned in the Void that lies behind the Walls\nof Night. The Silmarils were lost “unless the World be broken and\nre-made”, but each one found its home in one of the elements: sky,\nwater, and earth."

    "title": "Akallabêth",
    "page_id": "2360",
    "text": "The AKALLABÊTH is the fourth part of _The Silmarillion_, and the primary\naccount of the downfall of Númenor_._ It is relatively short, consisting\nof about thirty pages.\n\nThe story is written in the voice of Pengolodh, and is one of the more\nsignificant stories associated with Ælfwine.\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nAkallabêth (_The Downfallen_ in Adûnaic; Quenya is ''Atalantë;\n''Mar-nu-Falmar as another Quenya name.) is the story of the destruction\nof the Kingdom of Númenor, as written by Elendil. At the end of the\nFirst Age (described in detail in the _Quenta Silmarillion_), those of\nMen who had been helping Elves in their fight against Melkor were given\na new small continent of their own, free from the evil and sadness of\nMiddle-earth. It was located in the middle of the Great Ocean, between\nthe western shores of Middle-earth, and the eastern shores of Aman,\nwhere the Valar dwelt.\n\nAs they entered Númenor, the race of Men was forbidden to set sail\ntowards Aman, they gladly agreed to this because they regarded mortality\nas a gift and did not envy the Valar and Elves who could not die. For\ntwo and a half thousand years Númenor grew in might; Númenórian ships\nsailed the seas and established remote colonies, some of them in\nMiddle-earth. During that time the Elves of Middle-earth were engaged in\na bitter fight with Morgoth's former servant Sauron, who had turned into\na Dark Lord himself. The Elves asked for the help of the Númenórians and\nthey agreed but as time went on, over the course of one and half\nthousand years, Men desired immortality and rebelled against the Valar\nand the Elves. Their second last king, Tar Palantir, tried to amend the\nevil but it was too late. During this time, Númenor grew even more\npowerful.\n\nThe last king, Ar-Pharazôn, wanted control of Middle-earth, and so he\nattacked Sauron. Sauron's armies became afraid of the might of Númenor,\nand so he was captured and brought imprisoned to the Númenórian king.\nHowever, Sauron exploited his power to corrupt the Númenorian king to\nhis will. Soon he became his adviser, and much of Númenor obeyed his\nwill and worshipped Morgoth. Sauron convinced Ar-Pharazôn to try to\nassail Aman for immortality, desiring to destroy Númenor with the wrath\nof the Valar. However as this was done, the Valar appealed to Eru\nIlúvatar. Eru destroyed the Númenórian host, by crushing it under\nstones; however, he also caused the whole of Númenor to sink under the\nGreat Ocean. Just a few men of Númenórian royal blood, descendants of a\nlong line called “The Faithful” because they were uncorrupted by Sauron,\nhad fled Númenor by ships earlier with some gifts that Men received from\nthe Valar and the Elves in times of peace. They were led by Elendil the\nTall, and his two sons: Isildur and Anárion.\n\nThey set sail to Middle-earth, where the followers of Elendil\nestablished two kingdoms, which were managed as Númenórian provinces:\nGondor in the south and Arnor in the North. Some of the King's Men,\nenemies of Elendil, established other realms in exile to the south; of\nthese Umbar was the chief. The culture of Númenor became the dominant\nculture of Middle-earth (thus, Westron, a descendant of the Adûnaic\nlanguage of Númenor became the lingua franca). The sadness and the shock\nfrom the loss of a whole continent lived ever after in the hearts of\nkings of Númenórian descent. Arda was made spherical, and Aman was put\nfurther beyond Middle-earth, out of the reach of mortal men. Sauron,\nalthough greatly diminished and bereft of shape, escaped Númenor and\nreturned to Middle-earth once more.\n\n\nTextual history\n\nThe story originated with _The Lost Road_, an abandoned time-travel\nnovel. It was later adapted into back-story for _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nAs the Quenya name makes obvious, this is a retelling of the story of\nthe lost city of Atlantis, in the Middle-earth cadre. “Atalantë” is\nQuenya for “Downfallen”.\n\n\nCanon\n\nChristopher Tolkien notes in _The Peoples of Middle-earth_ that in the\nfinal version of Akallabêth, written by his father, the work is written\nin the voice of Pengolodh, and that the story was originally addressed\nto Ælfwine by him.\n\n    The authentic text began: “Of Men, Ælfwine, it is said by the Eldar\n    that they came into the world in the time of the Shadow of Morgoth\n    ...”\n\nChristopher then admits that this removal made the whole source lose its\nanchorage in Eldarin lore, and he believed he used poor judgment and\nexcessive vigilance, which also led him to alterations of the end of the\nparagraph (perhaps editorial work that was not his to properly make, as\nhe went against his father's original intent). Christopher also points\nout that the last paragraph of Akallabêth, as published in _The\nSilmarillion_, still contains indirect references to Ælfwine, the\n'Straight Road' and other 'future mariners', which he never altered or\nremoved."

    "title": "Two Lamps",
    "page_id": "2421",
    "text": "The TWO LAMPS, also known as THE LAMPS OF THE VALAR, refer to ILLUIN\n(Sky-blue), the lamp which formerly stood at the northern end of Arda\nand ORMAL (High-gold) which stood at the southern end of Arda.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nAfter the Valar entered the world and brought order to the seas and the\nlands and the mountains, and subdued the fires of Melkor, there was a\nneed for light. Aulë at the prayer of Yavanna forged two mighty lamps,\nIlluin and Ormal. Varda filled the lamps with light and Manwë hallowed\nthem, and the Valar set them up on high pillars, Illuin in the furthest\nnorth upon the pillar of Helcar, Ormal in the deepest south upon the\npillar of Ringol. In the middle of Arda, where the light of the lamps\nmingled, amid the Great Lake lay the Isle of Almaren, where the Valar\ndwelt.\n\nDestruction\n\nThe pillars were cast down and their lamps broken by Melkor. Lands were\nbroken, seas arose in tumult, and destroying flame from the broken lamps\npoured out over the Earth, marring it, causing the Valar to flee\nMiddle-earth for the Land of Aman, where they established the domain of\nValinor. Where Illuin fell, the Sea of Helcar was formed, of which\nCuiviénen was a bay.\n\n\nOther Versions of the Legendarium\n\nIn Tolkien's older writings (not used in the published version of _The\nSilmarillion_), the Valar sought peace with Melkor, asking his\nassistance with fixing the lamps upon Arda. Melkor, still envious and\nhateful of the rest of the Valar, agreed to give them a strong, sturdy\nsubstance. He gave Aulë ice. Melkor permitted the Valar to do as they\nwished until the fateful day when the Lamps' light and heat finally\nmelted the ice. The pillars crashed upon Arda, flooding it with water\nand darkness."

It was placed in the south of Middle-earth, and together with the\nnorthern lamp Illuin lit up all of Arda.\n\nRingol was destroyed by Melkor, and collapsed. This ruined a great part\nof Middle-earth, and waters most likely from the eastern ocean flowed in\nto fill the void. Later here was formed the inland Sea of Ringol."

    "text": "HELCAR (also spelt HELKAR) was the name of a great tower upon which\nthe mighty lamp Illuin sat.\n\n\nHistory\n\nHelcar was raised by the Valar to house the northern of the Two Lamps,\nIlluin. It was placed in the north of Middle-earth, and together with\nthe southern lamp Ormal lit up all of Arda. Helcar was destroyed by\nMelkor in an attack while the Valar rested from their labors, and\ncollapsed with devastating consequences to the world. This ruined a\ngreat part of Middle-earth, and waters (probably from Belegaer and the\neastern ocean) flowed in. Later here was formed the inland Sea of\nHelcar. The heat of Illuin then melted Helcar, and the meltwater of this\ntower formed the Sea of Helcar.\n\n\nEarlier versions of the legendarium\n\nIn some traditions it was said that Helcar was one of the two pillars\nmade by Melko (Melkor), not the Valar, out of ice - a substance that was\nnot yet known to the Valar."

    "title": "Sirion",
    "page_id": "2445",
    "text": "SIRION was a river in Middle-earth during the First Age, the principal\nriver of Beleriand. During most of its course, it was the border between\nEast and West Beleriand.\n\n\nSource\n\nThe Sirion's source was at Eithel Sirion on the eastern side of the Ered\nWethrin, which lay in between Ard-galen (later Anfauglith) and Mithrim\nand Hithlum. It was guarded by the tower of Barad Eithel.\n\nSirion flowed southwards along the border of the Ered Wethrin, passing\nthrough the Fen of Serech before entering the narrow steep-sided valley\nbetween the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath named the PASS OF SIRION.\nSirion then continued south into Beleriand, with the Forest of Brethil\nto the west, and Dimbar and then Doriath to the east. After leaving\nDoriath at Aelin-uial (the Fens of Sirion), it plunged below ground in\nthe Falls of Sirion at Andram, where the ground fell steeply. Three\nleagues southwards, the Sirion exited the underground caves at the Gates\nof Sirion. It then flowed further south through NAN-TATHREN until it\nreached the Bay of Balar, part of Belegaer, at the Mouths of Sirion. It\ntotal length was about three hundred and ninety miles.\n\nIn order from north to south, the principal tributaries of the Sirion\nwere the Rivil, flowing from Dorthonion until it met Sirion in the Fen\nof Serech; the Mindeb, which had its source in Nan Dungortheb and the\nEred Gorgoroth, the Teiglin, the Esgalduin of Doriath; the Aros flowing\nsouth from Dorthonion (and also containing the waters of the Celon from\nHimring and Himlad) which met at Aelin-uial, and the Narog, which joined\nSirion in Nan-Tathren.\n\nThe main crossing points mentioned in the Silmarillion were Brithiach\nwhere the road from Himlad, which crossed the Esgalduin at Iant Iaur,\ncrossed Sirion, and the Ferries of Doriath. The most important island in\nSirion was Tol Sirion. The original Minas Tirith was built here by\nFinrod Felagund in the strategic location controlling the Pass of Sirion\nwhere it entered Beleriand between the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath.\nShortly after Dagor Bragollach, Sauron captured it and the island became\nknown as Tol-in-Gaurhoth.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBarad Eithel, at the source of the Sirion in the Ered Wethrin, was a\nchief fortress of Fingolfin and his son Fingon, probably guarding a pass\ninto their realm of Mithrim. Further south, in the Pass of Sirion, lay\nTol Sirion. After the Coming of Men, the Edain of the House of Haleth\nmade their home in the Forest of Brethil, and the Sindar ruled by\nThingol lay secure within the Girdle of Melian in their realm of\nDoriath. At the outflow of Sirion into Belegaer, after the destruction\nof Eglarest and Brithombar, the Havens of Sirion were built by Círdan\nand his people."

It was fought on the plain of Tumhalad between the\nriver Narog and its tributary, the river Ginglith in FA 495.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe battle was fought as result of a massive Orc buildup beneath the\nEred Wethrin and in the Pass of Sirion. Messengers from Círdan the\nShipwright brought these tidings, with a message from Círdan concerning\na warning given to Círdan by the Vala Ulmo.

The Elves of Nargothrond,\nhowever, weren't used to battle in the open field for they had always\nwaged a secret war, ambushing but never assaulting the forces of\nMorgoth. Also, the evil hosts were larger than anticipated and led by\nthe Dragon, Glaurung.\n\nUltimately, the forces of Nargothrond couldn't withstand the assault of\nthe enemy host and were driven towards the plain of Tumhalad, where most\nof them, including King Orodreth and his kinsman Gwindor, were slain.\nOnly Túrin withstood the fiery attack of Glaurung for he wore the\nDragon-helm of Dor-lómin. The defeat suffered by the Elves paved the\nroad for the Sack of Nargothrond by Glaurung, and the death and\nenslavement of many captives, including Finduilas.",

The Ñoldor, led by Fëanor and his sons, tried to persuade\ntheir friends, the Teleri of Alqualondë, to give him their ships.\nHowever, the Teleri would not help in any way against the will of the\nValar, and in fact attempted to persuade their friends to reconsider and\nstay in Aman. Unwilling to take “no” for an answer, the Ñoldor started\ntaking the ships and sailing them away. This angered the Teleri, and\nthey threatened the Ñoldor with rocks and arrows, and they threw many of\nFëanor's followers out of the ships and into the harbor. They also began\nto attempt to block the harbour; however, it is only slightly possible\nthat the Teleri drew first blood.\n\n\nThe Battle\n\nThen the Ñoldor drew swords, and the Teleri their bows, and there was a\nbitter fight that seemed evenly matched, if not even in favor of the\nTeleri, until the second Host of the Ñoldor, led by Fingon, arrived\ntogether with some of Fingolfin's people. Misunderstanding the\nsituation, they assumed the Teleri had attacked the Ñoldor under orders\nof the Valar, and they joined the fight.\n\nConsequences\n\nIn the end many Teleri were slain and the ships taken and many of the\nstolen ships were wrecked in the waves. All that continued towards\nMiddle-earth were therefore cursed by Mandos. The act also had\nrepercussions in Middle-earth, when the Sindar, especially those of\nDoriath, found out about it, costing the Ñoldor the support of the\nSindar in their war against Morgoth; the Sindar King Thingol barred\nthose of the House of Fëanor, or any others that took place in the\nKinslaying, from entering his kingdom.

One Éored was one\nhundredth of the Éoherë - the full muster of Rohan. The Riders of an\nÉored could serve for a term or on a permanent basis. Each Éored was led\nby a captain. In times of war or unrest, the Marshals of the Mark each\nhad a battle-ready Éored as part of his household which he could command\nat his discretion.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the first three hundred years of Rohan's existence, the term was\nused widely to describe any significant number of Riders. Under King\nFolcwine, the military of Rohan was reordered. Under Folcwine, one Éored\nwas made up of 120 riders including their captain. Each Éored was also\nsupposed to comprise one-hundredth of the whole Muster of Rohan, not\nincluding the household of the King.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nThe changes made by Folcwine continued through the time of the War of\nthe Ring. While the force commanded by Théoden King son of Thengel at\nthe Battle of the Pelennor Fields did not number much more than half of\n12,000 riders, it was possibly the largest riding of the Rohirrim in\nhistory.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Éomer, the Third Marshal of the Mark, defied\norders and led his Éored in pursuit of a band of orcs who had entered\nRohan from the Emyn Muil. In the battle between Éomer's men and the\norcs, fifteen Riders were killed. Éomer's Éored thus numbered only 105\nwhen they encountered Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli on February 30,\n3019.\n\nMerry Brandybuck and Éowyn, disguised as a Rider named Dernhelm, rode\nwith the Éored commanded by Elfhelm to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields\non March 15. When the Rohirrim charged onto the battlefield, Éomer led\nthe first Éored in the center while Elfhelm's Éored was on the right\nflank and Grimbold's was on the left flank and the other companies\nfollowed behind. King Theoden rode before them all.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, Éomer returned to Minas Tirith with an Éored\nof Rohan's fairest knights to escort the body of their slain King home\nfor burial.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Old English, the word ÉORED means “Cavalry, band, or troop”. It\nmay have also been dervied from _eoh_ (“horse”) and _rád_ (“riding”)."

As such, there were usually three Marshals.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe first Marshal's charge was the King's lands. These included Folde\nand Harrowdale, and the muster also of Edoras, the capital. The second\nMarshal was usually charged with the West-Mark, including the Fords of\nIsen, a pivotal location in Rohan's defense during the War of the Ring.\nThe Hornburg (Helm's Deep) was the base of the West-Mark's Marshal. The\nEast-Mark often went to the third Marshal. His headquarters were at\nAldburg, once the home of Eorl the Young, first King of the Mark. The\nsecond and third Marshals, however, were interchangeable, and were\nassigned based on need by the King.\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring, Théoden King son of Thengel still\nheld loosely the title of first Marshal. During his youth, he had\nenjoyed leading the Muster of Edoras, but as he fell under the\ngrowing shadow of Saruman, and his servant Wormtongue, Théoden began to\nneglect his charges and duties as a Marshal. The second Marshal and\ncommander of the Westfold was Théodred, son and heir of Théoden. Éomer\nson of Éomund, nephew of the King, was the third Marshal, and filled his\nfather's post as commander of the East-Mark. Due to Théoden's condition,\nthe de facto commander at Edoras was Elfhelm, who acted as a Marshal of\nthe Mark. Háma, the loyal captain of the King's guard, was also at the\ncapital.\n\nWhen war with Saruman began, Théodred assumed command of Rohan's army,\ndespite the orders of his father speaking through his wicked counsellor\nGríma. Théodred ordered a muster to Edoras and soon led a good portion\nof the King's riders west to strengthen the Fords of Isen against\ninvasion. Later, Éomer defied the King and led his Éored (riders of his\nown household, his personal guard) to remove the herdfolk of the\nEast-Mark behind the fens of Entwash. There he encountered the Orcs\nreturning to Isengard from the Falls of Rauros, and later Aragorn,\nLegolas and Gimli.\n\nDuring the battles of the Lord of the Rings, the renewed Théoden assumed\ncommand of the army. With Théodred slain, Éomer acted as first Marshal.\nElfhelm led the muster of Eastfold, while Grimbold, previously a captain\nand hero of the battles at the Fords of Isen, commanded the riders of\nWestfold. After the War of the Ring was ended, Éomer King reordered the\npositions of the Marshals. He himself commanded the Muster of Rohan, and\ncaused the position of first Marshal to be held ever by the King or, in\nthe case of age or sickness, the King's heir (assuming the King had at\nleast another clear claimant to the throne). The positions of second and\nthird Marshal were largely dissolved, replaced by the titles Marshal of\nthe East-Mark and of the West-Mark.\n\nde:Marschall der Riddermark ru:Маршал Рохана"

It explained why\nThorin and Gandalf have to retake the Lonely Mountain, and it is an\nadventure recounted from the perspective of Bilbo Baggins.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nGandalf knew that Smaug could pose a serious threat if used by Sauron in\nwar, then dwelling in Dol Guldur in Mirkwood. He was thinking about the\nmatter when he met Thorin Oakenshield at Bree. Thorin also was concerned\nabout Smaug, but had the different motive of revenge and the reclaiming\nof the Dwarves' treasure in the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf agreed to help\nThorin.\n\nGandalf thought Bilbo, an unlikely choice, to be a suitable companion of\nThorin and his Dwarves for a number of reasons. First, he had observed\nthat Bilbo took an interest in the world at large, and was thus\nadventurous. Another reason is that Smaug would not recognize the scent\nof a Hobbit, advantageous to a stealthy operation. Thorin also did not\nthink highly of Hobbits, and putting Bilbo in the expedition might\nprevent the proud Thorin from rash actions — such as openly challenging\nSmaug.\n\nIt was Thorin's objections to Bilbo that Gandalf found most difficult to\novercome. Thorin believed that Bilbo was incapable of helping their\nadventure and that Gandalf might be simply meddling in his affairs for\nhis own reasons. After much debate, Gandalf convinced Thorin that Bilbo\nwould be a worthy member. It could be thought that Gandalf arranged this\nas he has foreseen the later event and wanted to create another front to\nfight Sauron.\n\nThe Quest\n\nThe Company started from the Shire to the Trollshaws. Three\nStone-trolls, Tom, William and Bert caught them. Luckily, they were\nsaved by Gandalf, by slamming the ground that hid the Troll cave from\nthe sunlight, thus turning them to stone. Then they passed the Hidden\nValley and arrived in Rivendell. They left Gandalf behind with the White\nCouncil and went to High Pass. After being saved by Gandalf again in\nGoblin-town, they were hunted by Bolg's wargs. They were saved by\nGwaihir and the other Great Eagles. After having a night in Beorn's\nhouse, they went to Mirkwood. Thranduil caught them and locked them in\nthe cells. While, Bilbo, who was wearing the Ring, he saved the Company\nby Barrels. And they found Bard who brought them to Lake-town. They\ntempted the Master of Laketown and they successfully reached the Lonely\nMountain.\n\n\nThe Quest in The Lord of the Rings\n\n“The Quest of Erebor” was originally written in the 1950s to be a part\nof _The Lord of the Rings_ but Tolkien decided not to include it, and\nonly a very abridged version of the tale occurred in the Appendices.\nThere are two manuscripts extant of the work. Both are written in the\nfirst person, from the perspective of Frodo Baggins. However, nearly all\nof the text consists of narration by Gandalf, who was telling the story\nat the request of Frodo in Minas Tirith after the coronation of King\nAragorn II Elessar in _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\n\nNotes\n\n-   The Quest caused Battle of Five Armies and indirectly caused the War\n    of the Ring.\n"

    "page_id": "2652",
    "text": "The HISTORY OF ARDA is divided into three time periods, known as the\nYears of the Lamps, Years of the Trees and Years of the Sun. A separate,\noverlapping chronology divides the history into 'Ages of the Children of\nIlúvatar'. The first such Age began with the Awakening of the Elves\nduring the Years of the Trees and continued for the first six centuries\nof the Years of the Sun. All the subsequent Ages took place during the\nYears of the Sun. Most Middle-earth stories take place in the first\nthree Ages of the Children of Ilúvatar.\n\n\nBasic history\n\nMusic of the Ainur\n\n_Main article: Ainulindalë_\n\nThe supreme deity is called Eru Ilúvatar. In the beginning, Ilúvatar\ncreated spirits named the Ainur. Ilúvatar made divine music with them.\nMelkor, Tolkien's equivalent of Satan, who was then one of the Ainur,\nbroke the harmony of the music, until Ilúvatar began a third theme which\nthe Ainur could not comprehend since they were not the source of it. The\nessence of their song symbolized the history of the whole universe and\nthe Children of Ilúvatar who were to dwell in it - the Men and the\nElves.\n\nThen Ilúvatar created Eä, the universe itself, and the Ainur formed\nwithin it Arda, the Earth, “globed within the void”: the world together\nwith the airs is set apart from _Kuma_, the “void” without. The first 15\nof the Ainur who descended to Arda, and the most powerful ones, were\ncalled Valar, and the Ainur of lesser might who followed were called\nMaiar.\n\nYears of the Lamps\n\n_Main article: Years of the Lamps_\n\nThe Years of the Lamps began shortly after the creation of Arda by the\nValar. After the Valar entered the world, there was a light veiling the\nground. The Valar took this light and concentrated it into two large\nlamps, Iluin and Ormal. The Vala Aulë forged great towers, one in the\nfurthest north, and another in the deepest south. The Valar lived in the\nmiddle, at the island of Almaren. The end of the Years of the Lamps was\nmarked by Melkor's destruction of the Two Lamps.\n\nYears of the Trees\n\n_Main article: Years of the Trees_\n\nShortly after the destruction of the Two Lamps, Yavanna made the Two\nTrees, named Telperion (the silver tree) and Laurelin (the gold tree) in\nthe land of Aman, where the Valar now lived. The Trees illuminated Aman,\nleaving Middle-earth in darkness, save the light of the stars.\n\nThe Elves awoke in Cuiviénen, and were soon approached by the Valar, but\nalso by Melkor. This event marked the beginning of the First Age. Many,\nthough not all, of the Elves were persuaded to go on the Great Journey\nwestwards towards Aman. Along the journey several groups of Elves\ntarried, notably the Nandor and the Sindar. The three clans who arrived\nat Aman were the Vanyar, Ñoldor, and the Teleri.\n\nThe Valar had captured Melkor and placed him in chains in Aman. After he\nappeared to repent and was released, Melkor sowed great discord among\nthe elves, and stirred up rivalry between the Ñoldorin King Finwë's two\nsons Fëanor and Fingolfin. Out of jealousy and hatred for the Silmarils\nthree gems crafted by Feänor that contained the light of the Two Trees\nMelkor stole them, killing Finwë, who was guarding the jewels. Then,\nwith the help of the creature Ungoliant, he destroyed the Two Trees and\nescaped to Middle-earth.\n\nBitter at the Valar's inactivity, Feänor and his house left to pursue\nMelkor, cursing him with the name 'Morgoth'. A larger host, commanded by\nFingolfin, followed him. They reached the Telerin port-city of\nAlqualondë, but their Lord forbade them to use the Telerin ships. Feänor\ndecided to take them by force and thus the first Kinslaying ensued and\nonly by the strength in numbers were the Teleri overcome and their fair\nships stolen.\n\nFeänor's host sailed on the vessels, and burned them when he arrived in\nMiddle-earth. Left behind, Fingolfin and his company crossed over to\nMiddle-earth through the Helcaraxë (also known as the Grinding Ice) in\nthe far north. Around the same time, but separately, Galadriel and\nCeleborn set sail for Middle-earth without the permission of the Valar.\n\nYears of the Sun\n\nThe Years of the Sun began when the Valar made the Sun and the Moon out\nof the final fruit of Laurelin and the final flower of Telperion and set\nthem in the heavens. Thereafter, years were reckoned in Middle-earth as\nthey are in our own real world. The First Age of the Children of\nIlúvatar continued into this new reckoning of time.\n\nAges of the Children of Ilúvatar\n\nFirst Age\n\n_Main article: First Age_\n\nFeänor was soon lost in an attack on Morgoth's Balrog s - but his sons\nsurvived, and founded realms the kingdoms of the House of Fingolfin.\n\nThe Long Peace lasted hundreds of years; during which time Men arrived\nover the Blue Mountains, but the peace was not to last; and one by one\nthe kingdoms even the hidden ones of Gondolin and Doriath eventually\nfell.\n\nAt the end of the age, all that remained of free Elves and Men in\nBeleriand was a settlement at the mouth of the River Sirion and another\nsettlement on the isle of Balar. Eärendil had possession of a Silmaril,\nwhich his wife Elwing's ancestors Beren and Lúthien had taken from\nMorgoth, but the Feänorians had a claim on the Silmaril still and so\nthere was another Kinslaying. Eärendil and Elwing took the Silmaril\nacross the Great Sea, to beg the Valar for aid.\n\nThey responded. Melkor was exiled into the Void; and most of his works\nwere destroyed. This came at a terrible cost, as Beleriand itself was\nsunk.\n\nSecond Age\n\n_Main article: Second Age_\n\nThe men who had remained faithful were given the island of Númenor, in\nthe middle of the Great Sea whilst the Elves were allowed to return\nhome.\n\nThe Númenóreans became great seafarers, but were jealous of the elves\nfor their immortality. Meanwhile, in Middle-earth it became apparent\nthat Sauron, Morgoth's chief servant, was still active. He worked with\nElven smiths in Eregion on the craft of rings, and forged the One Ring\nto dominate them all. The Elves noticed this and removed theirs.\n\nTowards the end of the age, the Númenóreans were growing increasingly\nproud. King Ar-Pharazôn humbled even Sauron and brought him to Númenor\nas a hostage. Sauron worked his way into Pharazôn's court, and became\nhigh priest in a cult of Morgoth. Eventually, Pharazôn was persuaded to\nattempt to invade Aman, promised that immortality would result.\n\nAmandil, chief of the Faithful, sailed westward to warn the Valar of\nthis. His son Elendil and grandsons Isildur and Anárion prepared to flee\neastwards. When the King's men had landed on Aman, the Valar lay down\ntheir guardianship of the world and called for Ilúvatar to intervene.\n\nThe world was changed into a sphere, and the straight road from\nMiddle-earth to Aman was broken. Númenor was utterly destroyed, as was\nthe fair body of Sauron. Elendil and his sons founded the realms of\nGondor and Arnor.\n\nSauron arose again and challenged them. The Elves allied with the Men to\nform the Last Alliance, which defeated him. His great One Ring was taken\nfrom him by Isildur but not destroyed.\n\nThird Age\n\n_Main article: Third Age_\n\nThe Third Age saw the rise in power of the realms of Arnor and Gondor,\nand their fall. Arnor was divided into three petty Kingdoms, which fell\none by one, whilst Gondor fell into the civil war of the Kin-strife,\nplague, Wainriders, and the Corsairs of Umbar.\n\nBy the time of _The Lord of the Rings_, Sauron had recovered again, and\nwas seeking the One Ring. He discovered that it was in the possession of\na Hobbit named Baggins, and sent out the Ringwraiths to find him and\nretrieve it.\n\nThe Ring-bearer, Frodo Baggins, is sent to Rivendell, where it is\ndecided that the One Ring must be destroyed once and for all and it can\nonly be unmade in the fiery depths of Mount Doom where it was forged. He\nsets out on this quest with eight other companions who comprise _The\nFellowship of the Ring_.\n\nAfter a long and difficult journey, he and Sam Gamgee finally complete\nthe mission, succeeding largely due to an unforeseen event that was out\nof their control. Sauron is thus destroyed forever and they are lauded\nas heroes.\n\nAragorn takes his place as King of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and\nGondor, at last restoring the line of Kings from the Stewards of Gondor.\n\nFourth Age and After\n\n_Main article: Fourth Age_\n\nThe end of the Third Age marked the end of the involvement of the Elves\nin Human affairs, despite a short-lived revival of Elven presence in\nGondor under Legolas. Most Elves who have lingered in Middle-earth leave\nfor Valinor. Those who remain behind “fade” and eventually diminish; a\nsimilar fate occurs for the Dwarves. Although Lonely Mountain (Erebor)\nbecomes an ally of the Reunited Kingdom, there are indications\nKhazad-dûm is refounded, and a colony is established under Gimli in the\nWhite Mountains (Ered Nimrais). The dwarves become ever more reclusive\nand disappear from human history. Morgoth's creatures are almost wiped\nout and never recover. During the later Fourth Age, as the heirs of the\nNúmenóreans forget their heritage, the tales of the earlier Ages become\nlegends and are eventually considered fantasies.\n\nSince then, Tolkien wrote that the ages have quickened, and he estimated\nthat the 20th century was in the Sixth or Seventh age.\n\nit:Storia di Arda ru:История Арды"

It is\nnowhere else referred to in the trilogy, so its particular meaning\nremains unclear. _Anor_ is the Elvish word for the Sun, so literally the\n_flame of Anor_ would have alluded to the light of the Sun, which had\noriginated in the fiery fruit of Laurelin, one of the Two Trees of\nValinor. Thus, Gandalf may have meant the power he gained as a servant\n(a Maia) of the Lords of the West, in defiance to the corrupted darkness\nof the Balrog.\n\nAlternatively, Gandalf may have been referring to Narya, the Ring of\nFire, which he wore and wielded, but it seems unlikely that Gandalf\nwould want to reveal his ownership of a Ring of Power —a matter of\nutmost secrecy—to one of his greatest enemies. However, considering that\nthe Balrog owed no allegiance to Sauron at that time, Gandalf may have\nbeen merely attempting to scare it away.\n\nIn Tolkien's earliest drafts, forms of this passage were variations on:\n“I am the master of White Flame. The Red Fire cannot come this way” (and\none variation mixes in the idea of Black Shadow, too). These terms seem\nto be symbolic - _white_ for the powers of good, but _red_ or _black_\nfor Sauron and his servants. As the text developed, the _Red Fire_ and\n_Black Shadow_ were lost. The _White Flame_ remained, but developed into\nthe more poetic _flame of Anor._ On this reading, then, the 'flame of\nAnor' doesn't refer to a specific thing, but is Gandalf's way of\nannouncing what he stands for, or perhaps his power as a servant of the\nValar."

He created seven\nDwarves, and was teaching them the language he had devised for them.\nWhen Ilúvatar confronted him about what he had done, Aulë offered his\ncreations to Ilúvatar, who accepted them and gave them life.\n\nHowever, the Fathers of the Dwarves had to wait until the Elves first\narrived, and Aulë laid them to rest in various places in the continent\nof Middle-earth.\n\nThe eldest of all, Durin, “lay alone” at Mount Gundabad in the north of\nthe Misty Mountains. He later founded the line of the Longbeards (or\n_Sigin-tarâg_ in Khuzdul), the Dwarves which were most friendly to the\nElves and Men, mostly referred to as Durin's Folk. His city was\nKhazad-dûm.\n\nTwo others were laid to rest near Mount Dolmed in the Blue Mountains,\nand they founded the lines of the Broadbeams and the Firebeards who\nlater lived in Nogrod and Belegost.\n\nThe other four Fathers of Dwarves were laid to rest in the far east, two\nof them at the northern end of the Orocarni, and the other two near the\nsouthern end of the range. These founded the lines of the _Ironfists_\nand _Stiffbeards_, and _Blacklocks_ and _Stonefoots_. No Dwarves of\nthese lines appear in the tales: however, as noted below, the Longbeards\nmay be formed out of Dwarves from all lines, and Dwarves from Durin's\nFolk may therefore have ancestors from these other lines. After the end\nof the First Age, when the ancestral homes of the Broadbeams and\nFirebeards were destroyed, these two lines merged with Durin's Folk, so\nthat Moria had a mixed population, and Thorin Oakenshield grew up in the\nremnants of the Firebeards' halls.\n\nOf the Fathers of the Dwarves, only Durin is said to have “lain alone”.\nThis can be interpreted as referring to the fact he was indeed laid down\nto rest alone while the other Fathers were laid to rest in pairs, but\nolder versions of the story suggest that it meant Durin alone had no\nfemale companion. The other Fathers did: references are made by Tolkien\nto the “Thirteen Dwarves” created by Aulë (Durin and the six pairs).

    "text": "The IRON MOUNTAINS, also known as ERED ENGRIN, and the MOUNTAINS OF IRON\nwere an immense mountain range in the northern part of Middle-earth.\n\nThe Iron Mountains have always been associated with bitterly cold\nclimates partly due to the influence of the evil Kingdom of Melkor.\nIt was also the former location of his ancient fortresses of Utumno and\nAngband.\n\n\nHistory\n\nAfter returning to Arda from the Outer Darkness with his allies through\nthe Door of Night, Melkor created the Iron Mountains and behind these\nwalls safe from the light of the northern lamp Illuin he delved the\ngreat fortress of Utumno. Angband was also delved into these mountains\nwest of Utumno. After Melkor's destruction of the Two Lamps, the Iron\nMountains were connected to the Blue Mountains of the West to the\nOrocarni of the east. Much later when the Valar decided to protect\nthe Elves from Melkor by defeating him and imprisoning him, the changing\nof the shape of Middle-earth effected the Iron Mountains as well.\nAfterwards, the mountain range was distorted but was still long with\nlengths stretching from the Helcaraxë in the far northwest to the\nOrocarni in the far east and rising to immense and frighting heights,\nwith enormous peaks such as Thangorodrim.\n\nIn the days of the War of the Jewels, the mountains protected Morgoth\nfrom being outflanked from the rear and with no enemy behind him, he was\nable to concentrate on the south. Because of its perilous heights,\nfrightening looks, and foul winds, no Elf ever passed through the\nmountains for any reason but the spies of Morgoth would always find ways\ninto the Beleriand, by unknown ways through the mountains. Morgoth's\nforces also captured Elves and brought them through the mountains to\nAngband.\n\nAfter the War of Wrath the Iron Mountains and Thangorodrim were\ndestroyed and the vast mountain chain was broken and disappeared for a\ngreat part of their length. North of the range lay the Forodwaith, a\nregion of ever-lasting cold. Remnants of the great mountain range in the\nThird Age included the Mountains of Angmar in northern Eriador, as well\nas the Ered Mithrin and the Iron Hills of northern Rhovanion. The\nIron Mountains remained unchanged after the Change of the World and ever\nafter. The only people known to have lived in the cold climates\nof the Forodwaith were a Mannish people known as the Lossoth, the\ndescendants of the people known as the Forodwaith who once lived in the\narea around the Iron Mountains of the Ice-Bay of Forochel.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe _Iron Mountains_ was known as the 'Ered Engrin' in Sindarin which\nmeant 'Mountains of Iron'."

    "text": "THE DOOR OF NIGHT (also called MORITARNON or TARN\nFUI) was a place set at the utmost West of Arda near the Void. The Door\nwas created by the Valar at the time of the making of the Sun and Moon.\nIt was vital in the cosmology of Middle-earth, forming the border\nbetween Arda and the void, as well as being the final prison of the\nrenegade Vala Morgoth Bauglir.\n\n\nCreation\n\nThe Door was created by the Valar as a gateway for the Sun to pass\nthrough. According to others, though, it was made expressly as a gateway\nthrough which to expel Morgoth. The following text describes the\ncreation of the Door in the _Ainulindale_:\n\n  _Thus came it that the Gods dared a very great deed, the most mighty\n  of their works; for making a fleet of magic rafts and boats with\n  Ulmo's aid - and otherwise had none of these endured to sail upon the\n  waters of Vai - they drew to the Wall of Things, and there they made\n  the Door of Night._\n\n\nPurpose\n\nThe Sun was to pass through the Door of Night as it travelled above\nArda. When the Sun passed through the Door, night would fall upon\nMiddle-earth. The Moon would then rise from its resting place and\ncontinue on its path over the Earth. The Sun would traverse the border\nof the Wall of the World, re-entering the world in the East, at the\nGates of Morning. At the same time the Moon would be sinking in the West\nand a new day would begin. At the conclusion of the War of Wrath, when\nEärendil the Mariner sailed to Aman to beseech the aid of the Valar,\nMorgoth was imprisoned outside the Door of Night. The following is told\nin _The Silmarillion_:\n\n  _“But Morgoth himself the Valar thrust through the Door of Night\n  beyond the Walls of the World, into the Timeless Void; and a guard is\n  set forever on those walls, and Eärendil keeps watch upon the ramparts\n  of the sky.”_\n\nAt the “End of Days” (which is referenced to even in _The Lord of the\nRings_ by Gandalf, Tom Bombadil, and others), Morgoth shall return as\nMelkor by breaking the Door of Night, precipitating the Last Battle\n(Dagor Dagorath).\n\n\nLocation\n\nA description of the location of the Door of Night is found in _The Book\nof Lost Tales Part One_:\n\n  _About the World are the Ilurambar, or Walls of the World. They are as\n  ice and glass and steel, being above all the imagination of the\n  Children of Earth cold, transparent, and hard. They cannot be seen,\n  nor can they be passed, save by the Door of Night. Within these walls\n  the Earth is globed: above, below and upon all sides is Vaiya, the\n  Enfolding Ocean. But this is more like to sea below the Earth and more\n  like to air above the Earth._\n\n\nAppearance\n\nThe Door of Night was likened to a huge gate of stone at the very edge\nof the world: the _Ilurambar_, invisible Walls of the World.\n\n  _There it still stands, utterly black and huge against the deep-blue\n  walls. Its pillars are of the mightiest basalt and its lintel\n  likewise, but great dragons of black stone are carved thereon, and\n  shadowy smoke pours slowly from their jaws._\n\n\nFate\n\nIn the _Book of Lost Tales Part One_ the fate of the Door of Night in\nthe West, and its counterpart, the Gates of Morning in the East, are\ndocumented as follows:\n\n  _For 'tis said ere the Great end come Melko shall in some wise\n  contrive a quarrel between Moon and Sun, and Ilinsor shall seek to\n  follow Urwendi through the Gates, and when they are gone the Gates of\n  both East and West will be destroyed, and Urwendi and Ilinsor shall be\n  lost._"

When the wind blew\nthrough the branches, the sound of far off seas and the cries of extinct\nsea-birds could be heard. Niphredil and Elanor grew in the grass.\n\n\nHistory\n\nCerin Amroth was the mound of Amroth, where Elanor flowers grew, that\nstood in the heart of Lórien and held the house of that king before he\nwas lost over a thousand years before.\n\nAragorn comes to Cerin Amroth where he meets lady Arwen again giving her\nthe Ring of Barahir and where they both plighted their troth.\n\nAs the Fellowship of the Ring, fresh from Moria, entered into the beauty\nand safety Lothlorian and rest beside the stream Nimrodel, Frodo could\nhear a singing voice mingled with the sound of rippling water. Legolas\nremembered and sang the tragic tale of Amroth and Nimrodel.\n\nWhen Durin's Bane, the Balrog of Moria, was awakened, an evil arose that\nbegan to surround the peaceful forest of Lothlorien. This became too\nmuch for Nimrodel to bare. She and her love, the King of Lothlorien,\nAmroth, began their journey southwards towards the sea and the undying\nlands. Nimrodel became lost in the White Mountains and perished never\nfinding her way to Amroth who waited upon a boat tethered to the shore\nnear Belfalas. A storm arose, driving the boat out to sea. In\ndesperation and love, Amroth lept from the boat to swim to shore, hoping\nto find Nimrodel, yet drowned in the dark stormy waters of the ocean.\nBoth lovers died painfully yearning to find each other. In this way\nsorrow first came to the land of Lorien.\n\nUntil the days of the Fellowship, the singing of Nimrodel could be heard\nin the falls near where she lived. The voice of Amroth can similarly be\nheard when the wind blows into Lorien from the south, where he had\ndrowned. It is in the mingling of the waters of the stream of Nimrodel,\nwith the waters of the Anduin and eventually the ocean, the two lovers\nare symbolically united.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring stopped at Cerin Amroth as they were being\nescorted through Lórien to the Lord and Lady in Caras Galadhon by\nHaldir. Frodo could feel the southern wind blow upon Cerin Amroth,\ncarrying the sounds and sights of the southern ocean.\n\nFrodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee followed Haldir up to the flet built in the\ncenter tree while the others rested in the grass. Frodo saw Caras\nGaladhon from the flet. He could see Anduin the Great and Southern\nMirkwood corrupted by Dol Guldur.\n\nReturning to the grass at the foot of Cerin Amroth, Frodo finds Aragorn\nplaying with an elanor flower, lost in memory. He sees him as if clothed\nin white as a young lord tall and fair, speaking elvish to someone he\ncannot see. Aragorn speaks in Elvish “fair Arwen, fairwell” then looks\ntowards Frodo and smiles.\n\nIt was here where Arwen, after Aragorn's death, went to die, in the\nplace Aragorn had proposed to her, sometime before the spring of FO 121\nand was where her grave was located."

    "text": "The DISASTER OF THE GLADDEN FIELDS or the BATTLE OF THE GLADDEN FIELDS\nwas a battle at the beginning of the Third Age, in which Isildur and a\nretinue of the Dúnedain of Arnor, marching home after the defeat of\nSauron, were attacked by a large group of Orcs from the Misty Mountains.\nThe king and his three eldest sons -- Elendur, Aratan, and Ciryon --\nwere slain and the Ring of Power was lost in the River Anduin. Only\nthree men survived the encounter, but the shards of Narsil were saved by\nOhtar, an esquire of the king. \n\nThe repercussions of the attack were wide-ranging, as Isildur had been\nking of both Gondor and Arnor, and his death left the two kingdoms to\nseparate into isolated realms. Arnor wouldn't be able to completely\nrecover from this catastrophic loss of a considerable part of its nobles\nand knights until the kingship of Aragorn II Elessar of the Elendili in\nthe Fourth Age. However, most importantly, Isildur's death prevented him\nfrom passing on the One Ring to the Keepers of the Three, which he had\ndivulged to his son Elendur to be his chief reason for visiting Elrond\nin Rivendell.\n\n\nHistory\n\nPrelude\n\nAfter that War of the Alliance, Isildur remained in Gondor for a year,\nregaining lost territories, and reorganising the realm. He sent the\ngreater part of the armies of Arnor back to Eriador via the Númenórean\nroad from the Fords of Isen to Fornost. After he was done with arranging\nthe affairs of the southern realm, he delivered the South Kingdom to\nMeneldil and forthwith designed to march to Rivendell. He had left his\nwife and youngest son there, yet he also greatly desired the counsel of\nElrond at that time. It was for this reason that he proceeded from\nOsgiliath into the Vale of the Anduin, and over the Cirith Forn en\nAndrath, which was the high-climbing pass of the Northern Misty\nMountains which led down into the valley of Rivendell. \n\nThe Battle\n\nThe Dúnedain host had traveled northwards from Lórien, marching along a\npath that led to Greenwood the Great wherein Thranduil was king. Their\nroute had been diverted by the flooding of the Anduin, which had\ncompelled Isildur to take the road on the sheer slopes on the eastern\nbanks of the river. King Isildur's party was flanked on its left by\nsteep cliffs overlooking the River Anduin, and to its left, by hills and\na forest.\n\nThe Dúnedain were singing marching songs and generally of good cheer as\ndusk drew close, at which time the lusty men heard the strain of orcs in\nthe forest hills. Isildur organised his retinue into a “Thangail,” a\nshield-wall two men deep and flexible at the flanks; it could be made to\nback up completely so as to form a defensive ring should the unit be\nsurrounded. The Dúnedain could only guess at the strength of the enemy,\nbut they perceived that the orc host was many times, perhaps even 10\ntimes as large as their own. Isildur expressed regret that the orcs\nshould have approached them at such uneven ground, for had it been level\nor rather downhill for the Dúnedain, then they should have formed up\ninto a “Dírnaith”, a wedge formation that could have shattered the\nmiscreant orcs. \n\nThe first orc onslaught came quickly, striking at the center of the\nDúnedain line after a volley of arrows had been fired. At this point,\nIsildur sent for his esquire, Ohtar, to take the shards of Narsil to\nRivendell for safekeeping should the battle go ill. The orcs were\ndiscomfited at no cost among the Dúnedain, all of whom towered above the\ntallest of the orcs. Piles of orcs had gathered before the Dúnedain, and\nthe orcs again kept their distance out of range of the powerful\nNúmenórean bows. Isildur judged that the orcs, in their typically craven\nfashion, were so thoroughly dismayed to be stung so badly in the fight\nthat they would not resume battle, but would rather stalk the Dúnedain\nfrom a distance. The king then resolved to bring his retinue onto lower\nand more level ground, yet the host had not marched more than a mile\nbefore the orcs returned again. Hope faded as the orcs crept towards\nthem in silence and under cover of darkness. In this second attack, the\norcs approached in a full crescent, resolving to pressure the Dúnedain\nat all points in their formation. Men were slain, and the formation\nstarted crumbling. Yet the Men of Númenór did their sires honour, for\nmany died at the cost of five orcs each. Ciryon and Aratan were killed,\nand Elendur convinced Isildur to flee and cross the Anduin if he could,\non whose other side he might find safety and make his way to Rivendell. \n\nThe Route of Isildur\n\nIsildur then cloaked himself with the ring, and sped down into the\nvalley. He made a long journey to the banks of the Anduin, and there\nparted with all of his arms and armour save for a short sword. The river\nwas hard to cross, thus, though rarely equaled in strength and vigour\neven by fellow Dúnedain, Isildur was exhausted when he reached the\nwestern shallows. There, reeds and rushes tangled him and the ring\nabandoned him, slipping from his fingers. Orc prowlers then caught sight\nof the large and imposing figure, and out of fear they shot at him and\nfled quickly, having pierced him in throat and heart. \n\nAftermath\n\nOnly Ohtar, and an unnamed companion; and a stunned combatant and\nesquire of Elendur, Estelmo, had survived the disaster. Isildur's body\nwas never recovered by men, and was secretly presumed captured and\nmutilated at Sauron's command. The orc host which had waylaid the\nDúnedain were quickly scattered by a relief force of woodsmen which\nnone-the-less had come too late to affect the fate of the king's\nretinue. The orc victory had been so Pyrrhic that it would take them\nmany years before they would gather the strength to venture out again in\nthe Vales of Anduin. Estelmo was recovered alive, but stunned from a\nclub's blow, and he told of how Isildur and Elendur had related to each\nother about the One Ring before their deaths. Isildur remarked: “I\ncannot use it. I dread the pain of touching it. And I have not yet found\nthe strength to bend it to my will. It needs one greater than I know\nmyself to be. My pride has fallen. It should go to the Keepers of the\nThree.”\n\nThen, probably the biggest consequences of the Gladden Fields was that\nthe union of Arnor and Gondor was broken by blood, but more importantly;\nthat Isildur never managed to give the Ring of Power to Elrond,\nGaladriel and Celeborn. All of them would have most likely decided to\ndestroy it long before Sauron could have gathered his spirit again and\nrefortified Mordor; in effect destroying the Dark Lord in the same way\nhe was extinguished beyond all hope of recovery by Frodo.",

The ones which attacked the\nfour Hobbits reanimated the corpses of the Kings of the Barrows. Most\noften the Barrow-wight came on the unwary traveller in the guise of a\ndark phantom whose eyes were luminous and cold. The voice of the figure\nwas at once horrible and hypnotic; its skeletal hand had a touch like\nice and a grip like the iron jaws of a trap. Once under the spell, the\nvictim had no will of his own. In this way the Barrow-wights drew the\nliving into the tombs of the downs. A dismal choir of tortured souls\ncould be heard inside the Barrow as, in the green half-light, the\nBarrow-wight laid his victim on a stone altar and bound him in chains of\ngold. He draped him in pale cloth and precious jewelry of the ancient\ndead, and with a sacrificial sword ended them.\n\n\n\nEast of the Brandywine River beyond the Old Forest were the\nBarrow-downs, the most ancient burial ground of men in Middle-earth.\nThere were no trees nor water there, but only grass and turf covering\ndome-shaped hills that were crowned with monoliths and great rings of\nbone-white stone. These hills were the burial mounds that were made in\nthe First Age of the Sun for the Kings of Men. For many ages the\nBarrow-downs were sacred and revered, until out of the Kingdom of Angmar\nmany terrible and tortured spirits fled across Middle-earth, desperately\nsearching to hide from the ravening light of the Sun. Demons whose\nbodies had been destroyed looked for other bodies in which their evil\nspirits could dwell. And so it was that the Barrow-downs became a\nhaunted and terrible place. The demons became Barrow-wights, the Undead\nwho animated the bones and jeweled armor of the ancient Kings of Men who\nhad lived in the First Age of the Sun.\n\n\n\nIn the darkness they were powerful spirits and they could be held at bay\nonly with the spell of strong incantations, such as Tom Bombadil's song.\nHowever, normally they could be destroyed only by exposure to light, the\nentity they hated and feared the most. The Barrow-wights were lost and\ntortured spirits, and their last chance to remain upon Earth depended on\nthe dark security of burial vaults. Once the stone chamber was broken\nopen, light would pour in on the Barrow-wights and they would fade like\nmist before the sun and be gone forever.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Barrow-wights began appearing in the Barrow-downs after the Dúnedain\nof Cardolan succumbed to the ravages of the Great Plague. They were put\nthere by sorcerers of Angmar who corrupted the souls of the inhabitants\nof the Barrow-downs. The sorcerers were sent by the Witch-king of Angmar\nwho wished to keep the Dúnedain away from there.\n\nOn September 28 of 3018 Frodo Baggins and his companions, Sam Gamgee,\nMerry, and Pippin while passing through the Barrow-downs were captured\none by one by the Barrow-wights, and trapped in what was believed to be\nthe cairn of the last prince of Cardolan.\n\nThere they were almost slain by a wight; three of the Hobbits had been\nlain in a barrow filled with a strange green light and were dressed in\nwhite robes and wore jewels and gold and had a sword across their necks.\nThe wight had finished an incantation, and was preparing to finish them\noff when Frodo summoned up the courage to slice off its hand; he then\ncalled upon Tom Bombadil when the wight extinguished the dim light in\nthe cavern. Bombadil performed some kind of exorcism on the barrow,\nthrough the rare power of his singing, which caused the wight to flee\nwith a shriek; he then gave the hobbits swords and then spread out the\ngold and treasures from the barrow on the grass, so that the barrow's\nspell was broken and no Wight could make habitat there.\n\n\n"

They were known as Middle Men by the Dúnedain,\nand were believed to have been descended from the same group of Men as\nthe Edain, the Atanatári. The only difference was that they didn't cross\nthe Blue Mountains into Beleriand, and therefore did not journey to\nNúmenor. The result of them not participating in the War against Morgoth\nwas their considerably shorter lifespan; the lifespan of the Dúnedain\nbeing lengthened by the Valar after the War of Wrath. They were\nimportant allies of Gondor and served as a buffer against the\nEasterlings and other foes. For a time many of them even became subjects\nof Gondor, as the realm extended beyond the river Anduin.\n\nEast of Greenwood the Great was the kingdom of Rhovanion, and this\nbecame the most important nation of the Northmen. In the fourteenth\ncentury of the Third Age, King Rómendacil II of Gondor sent his son\nValacar as an ambassador to Vidugavia, the so-called “King of\nRhovanion”.

In Gondor, Vinitharya became known as\nKing Eldacar and caused a civil war- the Kin-strife- because of his\nmixed Dúnedain/Northmen blood.\n\nShortly after the death of Vidugavia, a small group of Northmen moved to\nthe vales of the Anduin between the Gladden Fields and the Mirkwood,\nprobably to flee from the Wainriders, who had enslaved much of the\npeople of Rhovanion. After the evil Kingdom of Angmar was defeated by\nGondor and the remains of Arnor in TA 1977, these Northmen moved north\nand began to call themselves the Éothéod. They were skilled horse\nbreeders and horsemen. In TA 2510 they responded to a plea of help from\nthe trapped Gondor army at the Field of Celebrant. After they helped\nGondor win this important victory, they were rewarded the province of\nCalenardhon and became known as the Rohirrim. The Men of Rohan who\nfought on foot were called 'Yeomen'.\n\nThe Men of Dale and Lake-town were also counted under the Northmen, as\nwere the woodsmen of Mirkwood. Most of Rhovanion had been depopulated\nafter the wars of the Easterlings and the Great Plague. Their range was\nextremely wide; the Men of the North ranged to the western eaves of\nMirkwood to the southern slopes of the Grey Mountains and from the Long\nLake to Dorwinion on the Sea of Rhun.\n\nIn ''the Hobbit, ''these men carved out a potentially precarious living\nin the eaves of Mirkwood, living as hunters, loggers, trappers, and\nfishermen on the Anduin and its tributaries. They also lived in constant\nfear of attack from Dol Guldur.\n\n\nMilitary\n\nThe larger, more established kingdoms of the North (such as Dale and\nLaketown) would have at least some semblance of a regular standing army.\nThese would have mostly consisted of a force of dismounted men-at-arms,\narmed with a sword and a wooden shield. The Men of the North might have\nreceived some help from Gondor in metalworking, along with their Dwarven\nallies nearby. A militia or town guard would have also been used\nextensively, for the majority of the humans in the north were farmers\nand thus needed their full attention kept on the all-important harvest.\n\nFurther up the military hierarchy would be a force of axemen, for many\nof the woodcutters and loggers in Mirkwood would have learned to use the\naxe from adolescence.\n\nA force of mounted knights and light cavalry would probably have been\navailable for scouting and other duties, for the terrain from Dale to\nDorwinion is mostly flat and featureless, except for a few trees,\nshrubs, and ponds scattered randomly.\n\nBy contrast, the rural, less established kingdom of Rohan trains almost\nevery legitimate soldier it has to fight from horseback, while the\ninfantry division is left to be composed of not soldiers but, as Gamling\nstates in The Two Towers, “every villager able to wield a sword”.\n\n\nLanguages\n\nBeing human means that the Northmen spoke the Common Speech. However,\nthey also have native languages. For example, the Rohirrim spoke\nRohirric, for which Tolkien appears to have been inspired by Old\nEnglish, seeing names like “Éowyn” and “Thengel”. Whereas the Bardings\nand Wood-men speak a similar language to the men of Rohan in terms of\ngross language group, as seen in Old Norse names (akin to Old English\nand Norse being in the same language group), i.e. the name “Brand”\ntranslating to “torch”. The language was not similar to Dwarvish; rather\nthe Dwarf names appearing in _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_\nare Dwarf names given in the language of the Men of Dale, not the native\nDwarf language.  They never shared languages with the Elves or with\ntheir Western, Southern, and Eastern counterparts; other than Westron.\n\nde:Nordmenschen it:Uomini del Nord ru:Северяне"

They were lands consisting mostly of\nhills, lowlands, and plains and bottomlands. There were some dense\nforests, as with the Forest of Brethil but much of it was scattered\nwoodlands. There was also a moorland called the Moors of the Nibin-Noeg\nnear the Forest of Brethil. The climate was mostly humid with mild\nwinters and mild summers with some influence from the cold of the north\naround the gap between the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath.\n\n\nHistory and Culture\n\nThe region was populated and controlled by both the Sindar and the\nÑoldor. Vast territory between the River Sirion, the northern mountains\nand the sea belonged to Finrod with the blessing of Thingol, Lord of\nBeleriand. Círdan was the Lord of the Havens of the Falas, the lands\naround the two rivers Brithon and Nenning next to the sea. The Forest of\nBrethil was settled in by the Men of the Haladin, who guarded it and\nDoriath from all enemies. The gap between the Ered Wethrin and the\nEchoriath was looked after by Orodreth, a relative of Finrod at the\nFortress of Tol Sirion until it was conquered by Sauron. The land of\nArvernien around the Mouths of Sirion was populated with both Sindar and\nÑoldor, especially after the conquest of the realms of the north and the\nBeleriand by Morgoth in the mid and late centuries of the First\nAge.\n\nThe dominant language of the West Beleriand was Sindarin except in\nNargothrond and the realm around Tol Sirion where Quenya was spoken. The\nMannish language was used in Brethil by the men who lived there. Both\nSindarin and Quenyan were probably used in Arvernien in the Havens of\nSirion, as it was populated with many elves that were able to escape\nfrom the fallen realms of the Beleriand and the north.\n\nAll of the West Beleriand was destroyed after the War of Wrath and fell\nbeneath the waves of the sea."

Valarin was\ndeveloped as part of their assumption of physical forms.\n\n\nHistory\n\nHowever, the Elves found Valarin alien, sometimes unpleasant, with very\nfew of them ever deigning to learn the language. Some Valarin words were\nadopted by the Elves as part of the growing Quenya lexicon, particularly\nby the Vanyar. The Valar learnt Quenya instead to converse with the\nElves or with each other if Elves were present.\n\nIt was not just the Elves who borrowed from Valarin. When Melkor and\nSauron devised the Black Speech, at least one word, NAZG (ring) was\nborrowed from the Valarin equivalent (NAŠKAD). As Ainur, both Melkor and\nSauron would have spoken Valarin.\n\nValarin bears no relation to any of the other Languages of Middle-earth\nas it arose beyond Arda. Little is known of it, save a few words (mainly\nproper names) although it seems that Valarin used lengthy constructions.\nThe Valarin word for Telperion is, for example, Ibrîniðilpathânezel,\nwhich is eight syllables long.\n\nThe only language before Valarin was the Music of the Ainur, the purest\nform of language as it was thought itself with a self-sufficient\nstructure. Eru Ilúvatar only showed the Ainur their music in a different\nform by adding the final note to their song: Eä, “_Be_”.\n\nIn the older versions of _The Silmarillion_ and in the Lhammas, it is\nshown that Valarin was further subdivided into three categories:\nOromëan, Aulëan and Melkian, with all Elven languages arising from the\nfirst category. J.R.R. Tolkien later rejected this view."

Before that time, Sauron\nhad been secretly living in the stronghold Dol Guldur in Mirkwood, and\nfrom there he had directed numerous attacks against Gondor and Arnor. In\n2060, Gandalf and others of the Wise began to suspect that the evil\npresence in Dol Guldur was Sauron. Gandalf went to Dol Guldur to\ninvestigate in 2063 and Sauron fled into the East, around Rhûn.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the Watchful Peace, Gondor was free from attacks by Sauron's\nminions so it strengthened its borders while keeping a watchful eye on\nthe east, as Minas Morgul - where the Nazgûl nevertheless remained quiet\n- was still a threat on their flank and Mordor was still occupied\nby Orcs. The Dúnedain of the North also had peace for a time.\n\nOver the course of four centuries, Gondor's defenses began to relax. The\nforts along the Anduin guarding Gondor's eastern front were neglected.\nIn the west, garrisons were no longer maintained at Isengard and\nthe Glittering Caves - two strongholds guarding the gap between the\nMisty Mountains and the White Mountains.\n\nIn the north, Arnor had been conquered long before, but the Hobbits of\nthe Shire prospered, getting their first Took Thain and colonizing\nBuckland.\n\nSauron, however, was not idle in the east: he created a strong alliance\nbetween the various tribes of Easterlings, so that when he returned he\nwas more powerful than before and had many Men in his service. Sauron\nreturned to Dol Guldur in TA 2460 and the Watchful Peace ended. Evil\ncreatures had already begun to trouble the north, while attacks on\nGondor resumed soon afterwards. In TA 2475, Ithilien was invaded by\nUruks from Mordor. Around 2480, Orcs repopulated Moria and other\nstrongholds in the Misty Mountains. In 2510, Men from Rhûn called the\nBalchoth, successors to the Wainriders, took advantage of the lightly\nguarded forts along the Anduin and crossed the river en masse. Only the\ncoming of the Éothéod led by Eorl helped Gondor defeat the Balchoth in\nthe Battle of the Field of Celebrant.\n\nDespite that victory, Gondor remained under constant threat from the end\nof the Watchful Peace to the time Sauron and Mordor were finally\noverthrown, in the year 3019."

    "title": "Fairy tale",
    "page_id": "2983",
    "text": "A FAIRY TALE is a story featuring folkloric characters such as fairies,\ngoblins, elves, trolls, giants, and others. The fairy tale is a\nsub-class of the folktale. These stories often involve princes and\nprincesses, and modern versions usually have a happy ending. In cultures\nwhere demons and witches are perceived as real, fairy tales may merge\ninto legendary narratives, where the context is perceived by teller and\nhearers as having historical actuality. However unlike legends and epics\nthey usually do not contain more than superficial references to religion\nand actual places, persons, and events. Although these allusions are\noften critical in understanding the origins of these fanciful stories.\n\nMany people, including Angela Carter in her introduction to the _Virago\nBook of Fairy Tales_ have noted that a great deal of so-called fairy\ntales do not feature fairies at all. This is partly because of the\nhistory of the English term “fairy tale” which derives from the French\nphrase _contes de fée_ which was first used in the collection of Madame\nD'Aulnoy in 1697. As Stith Thompson and Carter herself point out,\ntalking animals and the presence of magic seem to be more common to the\nfairy tale than fairies themselves.   \n\nSome folklorists prefer to use the German term _Märchen_ to refer to\nfairy tales, a practice given weight by the definition of Stith Thompson\nin his 1977 edition of _The Folktale_: “a tale of some length involving\na succession of motifs or episodes. It moves in an unreal world without\ndefinite locality or definite creatures and is filled with the\nmarvelous. In this never-never land humble heroes kill adversaries,\nsucceed to kingdoms and marry princesses.” (Thompson: 8)\n\n\nHistory\n\nAlthough in the late nineteenth and twentieth century the fairy tale\ncame to be associated with children's literature, adults were originally\nas likely as children to be the audience of the fairy tale. The fairy\ntale was part of an oral tradition: tales were narrated orally, rather\nthan written down, and handed down from generation to generation. The\ntales often had sad endings; such was the penalty for dealing with the\nfairy folk.\n\nLater fairy tales were about princes and princesses, combat, adventure,\nsociety, and romance. Fairies had a secondary role. Moral lessons and\nhappy endings were more common, and the villain was usually punished. In\nthe modern era, fairy tales were altered, usually with violence removed,\nso they could be read to children (who according to a common modern\nsentiment should not hear about violence).\n\nSometimes fairy tales are simply miraculous entertainments, but often\nthey are disguised morality tales. This is true for the Brothers Grimm\n_Kinder- und Hausmärchen_, and much of the drily witty, dead-pan, social\ncriticism beneath the surface of Hans Christian Andersen's tales, which\ninfluenced Roald Dahl.\n\nThe fairy tale has ancient roots, older than the “Arabian Nights”\ncollection of magical tales, in antiquity: Cupid and Psyche, Bel and the\nDragon. Fairy tales resurfaced in literature in the 17th century, with\nthe Neapolitan tales of Giambattista Basile and the later _Contes_ of\nCharles Perrault, who fixed the forms of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.\n\nAn extensive collection of European fairy tales were published by Andrew\nLang in a series of books: _The Red Fairy Book_, _The Orange Fairy\nBook_, and so forth. These provide some excellent examples of the genre.\n\nAccording to a 2004 poll of 1,200 children by UCI Cinemas, the most\npopular fairy tales (in the USA?) are:\n\n1.  Cinderella\n2.  Sleeping Beauty\n3.  Hansel and Gretel\n4.  Rapunzel\n5.  Little Red Riding Hood\n6.  Town Musicians\n\nIn addition, the _Arabian Nights_ stories like _Aladdin and his\nWonderful Lamp_ and _wikipedia:Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves_ are often\nthought to be fairy tales themselves.\n\n\nContemporary fairy tales\n\nIn contemporary literature, many authors have used the form of fairy\ntales for various reasons, such as examining the human condition from\nthe simple framework a fairytale provides. Some authors seek to recreate\na sense of the fantastic in a contemporary discourse. Sometimes,\nespecially in children's literature, fairy tales are retold with a twist\nsimply for comic effect, such as _The Stinky Cheese Man_ by Jon\nScieszka. Other authors may have specific motives, such as multicultural\nor feminist reevaluations of predominantly Eurocentric masculine\ndominated fairy tales, implying critique of older narratives. The figure\nof the damsel in distress has been particularly attacked by many\nfeminist critics. Examples of narrative reversal rejecting this figure\ninclude _The Paperbag Princess_, by Robert Munsch, a picture book aimed\nat children in which a princess rescues a prince, or Angela Carter’s\n_The Bloody Chamber_, which retells a number of fairytales from a female\npoint of view.\n\nOther notable figures who have employed fairy tales include A. S. Byatt,\nJane Yolen, Donald Barthelme, Robert Coover, Margaret Atwood, Tanith\nLee, James Thurber, Kelly Link, John Bly and many others.\n\n    _Fairy tales are more than true -_\n    _not because they tell us dragons exist,_\n    _but because they tell us dragons can be beaten._\n\n&nbsp;\n\n    'G. K. CHESTERTON''"

As for vegetation, Far\nHarad, at least the part closest to Gondor and Umbar consisted of\nscattered woodlands, and further into the south short grasslands until\nit ran into the desert. The deep southern region consisted of vast\ndensely forested areas with some hills.\n\nThe climate was mostly warm and humid with parts of Far Harad and Umbar\nhaving mild winters, hot, dry summers with warm breezes coming from the\nsea. The farther south had a semi-arid to an arid climate as it\nproceeded into the desert regions. The deep southern region’s climate\nwas unknown but was possibly mild compared to the others.\n\n\nInhabitants\n\nThe south is inhabited by the tribes of the Haradrim or Southrons,\nCorsairs of Umbar, and Black Númenóreans. Animal life included monstrous\nOliphaunts or Mumakil, which probably came from the Deep South and were\nexploited for use in warfare and probably hard labor as well. These\nelephants and Haradrim show up in the battle for Minas Tirith, mainly\nagainst Rohan. The population was densest in the region of Umbar and\nsparsest further into the south. The dominant language seemed to Westron\nand many of its people worshiped Sauron and the Darkness.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThese lands existed back in the earliest days of Middle-earth but seemed\nto be much wider and much more connected as part of the greater\ncontinent during the early part of the Years of the Trees. After the\nBattle of the Powers, the Great Sea (Belegaer) was widened and a Great\nGulf was made between the southern part of the Beleriand and the rest of\nthe continent, sundering the two parts from each other. The south could\nonly be reached through two land corridors: a narrow strip that ran\nthrough the land just below the White Mountains were the Nandor passed\nthrough after separating from the main host of the journeying elves, and\na larger corridor of land just below Cuiviénen and Hildórien.\n\nAfter the War of Wrath, the gulf between the northern part of the\ncontinent and the southern part was widened with the loss of the\nBeleriand and part of the land in the south, leaving a coastal area that\nwould once be called Umbar. The inland Sea of Helcar shrunk into the Sea\nof Rhûn and with this the south could now be approached by many ways,\nbarring the forces of evil that would later rule these lands. Throughout\nthe Second and Third ages, the south became populated with tribes of Men\nwho never really became civilized and thus were easily swayed by the\nDark Powers and were a constant threat to the Free Peoples of the West.\n\nAfter the Fall of Númenor in the Second Age, the Black Númenóreans who\nworshiped the Dark Powers settled there and became rulers of Umbar and\nhad a great influence on the Southrons. For a time, the south was ruled\nand influenced by the Dúnedain kingdom of Gondor but that was soon lost.\nPirates known as the Corsairs ruled Umbar up onto the War of the Ring.\nThe south from then on was populated by the enemies of the Free Peoples\nuntil pacified by King Aragorn II Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom after\nthe War of the Ring."

    "text": "_This article is on the large region in Middle-earth. For the land\nacross the ocean to the west see the Undying Lands._\n\nThe WEST refers to the large region Middle-earth and includes the lands\nof Beleriand (up to the end of the First Age) Lindon, Eriador, Gondor,\nRhovanion, and others, essentially all the lands west of Rhûn and\nMordor. It is also used to describe the Free Peoples of Middle-earth\nlike the Elves, Men, Dwarves, Hobbits and Ents particularly during the\nThird Age. West is normally 'the good' versus the bad from the East.\n(i.e. Sauron, Harad and Easterlings)\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe Beleriand consisted of mostly plains and lowlands with scattered\nwoodlands, dense forests, and grasslands. The lands of Hithlum, Mithrim,\nand Dor-lómin were plateaus consisting of short grasslands and scattered\nwoodlands surrounded by mountains. Dorthonion was mostly a plateau\nsurrounded by a mountain range in its south and consisted of moorlands\nand dense forests in its north. There were some hill lands such as the\nones near the Blue Mountains and Himring.\n\nThe Beleriand’s climate varied in degrees. The West Beleriand consisted\nof cold winter, cool to mild summers in the northern part with cold, dry\nprevailing winds from the north, and warm, moist prevailing winds from\nthe sea. The southern part consisted of mild winters, mild summers with\nwarm, moist prevailing winds coming primarily from the sea. The East\nBeleriand consisted of severe, dry winters, short, cool summers with\nstrong prevailing winds coming form the northern part near Morgoth’s\ndomain. The southern part had mild winters, mild summers with warm,\nmoist prevailing winds from the sea with the exception of the realms of\nMaedhros and Maglor between Dorthonion and the Blue Mountains, which had\ncold winters and mild summers due to their proximity to the north.\n\nAfter the fall of the Beleriand, the West’s terrain from Lindon to\nRhovanion and Gondor was mostly lowlands and plains consisting of mostly\nshrubs, shrubs thickets and scattered woodlands. Grasslands prevailed in\nRohan, formerly Calenardhon and dense forests were in areas such as\nFangorn and Mirkwood. Hill lands were mostly in mid-Eriador, next to\nMisty Mountains, the Wold in Rohan, and the lands east of the Grey\nMountains.\n\nThe climate variation was mostly the same as it was during the First Age\nwith severe winters and cool summers in the lands near the cold north,\nwith cold prevailing winds. Cold but milder weather conditions dominated\nnorthern Eriador and northern Rhovanion, and south from that mild\nconditions with a tendency toward fog existed throughout most of the\nrest of Eriador and the lands to the south, with warm, moist prevailing\nwinds coming from the sea. Southern Rhovanion was overall a bit colder\nthen the north possibly due to its shielding from the warmer prevailing\nwinds from the sea, from the Misty Mountains. Both Rohan and Gondor were\nwarmer climates due to their proximity to the south and the influence of\nthe warm prevailing winds from the sea.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the Years of the Trees and the First Age during the days of the\nBeleriand, the West consisted of mostly good races which were Moriquendi\nelves, Noldorin exiles, and later Edain men with some faithful\nEasterlings, and Dwarves living in the mountains. The enemy was in the\nNorth. With the destruction of the Beleriend, the West became the lands\nof Lindon, Eriador, Gondor, Rhovanion, and others with the East being\nthe lands of Rhûn and Mordor. In the Second Age, the West's population\nwas mostly primitive men and a few elves located mostly in Lindon,\nEregion, and some in Greenwood the Great. There were some tribes of Orcs\nliving in the Misty Mountains with some in the Grey Mountains. The\nenemies, Sauron and Easterlings mostly came from Mordor and Rhûn in the\nEast until their defeat during the War of the Last Alliance.\n\nIn the Third Age, the West was mostly nations of Men living in the\nRealms in Exile (Arnor and Gondor). Other races such as Dwarves and\nElves decreased in numbers becoming hidden peoples living in realms such\nas: Moria, the Lonely Mountain, Lothlórien, and Mirkwood. Hobbits, once\na minor race living in the Gladden Fields migrated to Bree and then The\nShire, the most populated of their realms. Ents diminished in numbers\nremained solely in Fangorn forest. The enemies from then on were\ntraditionally located in the East, though for some time many of the\nthreats came from within the West in places such as Angmar, Misty\nMountains, and Dol Guldur but during the latter half of the age the\nenemies were solely from the East.\n\nThe dominant language in the West during the First Age was Elvish and\nearly Mannish and later Westron prevailed with others being used only\nregionally."

After the destruction of Beleriand, the shape of the region changed\nconsiderably becoming more of dried land consisting of scattered\nwoodlands and lowlands. The Sea of Helcar disappeared, possibly\nshrinking into the smaller Sea of Rhûn, Cuiviénen merged with the land\nand was no longer along the coast, Hildórien still bordered the East Sea\nto its east; however, both of these realms were probably no longer\ninhabited as they once were. The Orocarni Mountains still remained\nintact and unbroken.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Elves and Dwarves (in the mountains) were the first to inhabit the\nEast and still continued to do so even after many Elves left on the\nGreat Journey to Valinor. Later during the First Age, Men inhabited the\nland and quickly spread into the west but only the tribes of the Edain\nmoved into the Beleriand escaping the Dark Powers, while the earlier\nEasterling tribes stayed and continued to serve them.\n\nThroughout the Second and Third ages, the region still continued to be\ninhabited by the Easterlings who completely dominated the area and still\nserved the Dark Powers. The Easterlings also sometimes refer to their\nland as the Land of the Rising Sun. Dwarves probably still lived in the\nOrocarni mountain range as well as other men and creatures. The Blue\nWizards - Pallando and Alatar were said to have gone out there in\nwagons, but never returned. However, Tolkien never expanded much on this\narea.\n\nGenerally, throughout the three ages of Middle-earth the east has often\nbeen the source of those who served Morgoth and Sauron and other enemies\nof the Free Peoples."

The _father-name_ is often based on the father's own\nname or (in later times) was derived from old legends. A father-name may\nactually be the same as the father's, with a suffix added, such is the\ncase with Gildor Inglorion. A _mother-name_ is given later at birth and\nhad great significance, as Elven mothers are said to hold great insight\ninto the character of their children. It is also believed that mothers\nhave the gift of prophecy in matters concerning their children.\n\nThe _epessë_ or the “after-name” is the third type. The after-name is\ngiven later in life, but not necessarily by their kin, as a title of\nadmiration. In some circumstances, the _epessë_ is chosen by the Elf\nhimself or herself. An Elf could be referred to by any of the three, but\nthe _epessë_ typically took preference.\n\nIn songs and history, the _epessë_ is usually used rather than the\n_essi_.\n\n\nExamples\n\n-   MAEDHROS, the oldest son of Fëanor, was by his brothers referred to\n    as _RUSSANDOL_ (copper-top): an _epessë_ he had earned because of\n    his ruddy hair. _Maedhros_ itself was an _epessë_: his father-name\n    had been _Nelyafinwë_ (Finwë the third: Fëanor's own father name had\n    been (Curu)finwë), and his mother-name _Maitimo_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   _GIL-GALAD_ (Star of Radiance) is the mother-name of _Rodnor_, son\n    of Orodreth. He is given the epessë _Ereinion_ because of his\n    heritage: the name literally means “Scion of Kings”.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   _CÍRDAN_ is the _epessë_ of a Telerin Elf who remained in Beleriand,\n    and later Lindon, until the end of the Third Age. His original name\n    had been forgotten, and he was referred to always as Círdan, a title\n    that had been given to him as Lord of the Falas before the First\n    Age.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   FINROD FELAGUND is usually referred to as _Felagund_ (hewer of\n    caves), an original derogatory nickname given to him because of his\n    dwellings at Nargothrond. Finrod adopted the name, and made it a\n    title of honour.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   _GALADRIEL_ is the Sindarin translation of Alatáriel, the latter\n    being the Telerin _epessë_ originally given to her by Celeborn.\n    _Galadriel_ means “Maiden Crowned by a Radiant Garland”. The name\n    itself is an _epessë_: her father-name is Artanis (_noble woman_)\n    and her mother-name is Nerwen (_man-maiden_).\n\nde:Epesse pl:Epessë sk:Epessë"

About it lay a smooth sward, shelving\ndown on all sides to its bare umbroken rim.”\n\n\nGeography\n\n\n\nThe lake lay less than a mile east and a little below the Great Gates of\nMoria. It was long and oval, shaped like a great spear-head thrust deep\ninto the northern glen of the vale. Its waters were dark: a deep blue\nlike clear evening sky and there was a smooth sward of grass around its\nrim.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the First Age, Durin the oldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves\nwandered into Azanulbizar vale and beheld in a small, still lake a\nreflection of himself bearing a crown of seven stars. The stars were the\nconstellation Durin's Crown which the elves call Valacirca and men call\nthe Big Bear. Because of this sign Durin chose to build his great hall\nMoria in the mountains above that vale. The name Kheled-zâram is in\nKhuzdul and means “Glass-lake”. In Westron it was called MIRRORMERE, it\nis probably so named because the waters of the lake were always smooth\nand the stars could always be seen reflected in its surface no matter\nthe time of day. Only Durin, however, could see his own reflection.\n\nThe Dwarves of Durin's Folk regarded this site as sacred and built a\nmonument there. It was a single stone column called Durin's Stone,\nstanding by the roadside. After Moria was abandoned it fell into\ndisrepair, and in the last years of the Third Age it was cracked,\nweather-worn, and broken at the top.\n\nWhen Balin came to retake Moria in TA 2989 one of his companions, a\ndwarf named Flói was slain in a battle before the Gates and was buried\nin a place of honour by the banks of Kheled-zâram. Balin himself was\nkilled here five years later, by an orc arrow, when he went alone to\nlook into the lake.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring stopped briefly at Kheled-zâram while Gimli,\nFrodo, and Sam took time to look into the lake, even though they were in\ngreat hurry."

When Lord Aragorn entered the city,\nPeregrin persisted in crudely referring to Aragorn by the nickname he\nhad garnered as a Ranger of the North: “Strider”, even in front of\nforeign dignitaries such as King Éomer of Rohan. Aragorn was amused, and\ndecided that the name of the lineage he founded would be “Telcontar”,\nwhich translates as “Strider” in Quenya. Members of the House of\nTelcontar are referred to as the “Telcontari”, because Telcontari\n(Striders) is the plural of Telcontar in Quenya.\n\nAragorn then took the royal name “Elessar”.\n\nWith Queen Arwen, King Elessar reigned for 120 years, before finally\nsurrendering his life. This long reign is attributed to Elessar's\ndescent from the Men of Númenor, who are blessed with long life (he was\n87 when he took the throne). He rebuilt the old capital Annúminas in\nArnor and later ruled from this northern capital, although the old\ncapital Minas Tirith was still of great political importance. Elessar\nhad one known son, Eldarion, and an unspecified number of daughters.\nKing Elessar was buried with higher honor in Minas Tirith. King Eldarion\n(his name meaning “From the Elves” in reference to his mother Arwen) was\n“full ripe for kingship” at the time, and ruled for an unspecified\namount of time well into the Fourth Age of Men.

During the Years of the Trees when the Valar removed to Aman,\nthe first real and dense forests arose and spread throughout\nMiddle-earth in parts of the Beleriand, in Eriador where a vast forest\nreigned for many thousands of years, and some in the land of Rhovanion\nwhere Greenwood stood. The vast lands of the south of Middle-earth and\nmuch of the Dark Land where very few people lived also had many dense\nforested areas. All forests in the Beleriand perished with its\ndestruction at the end of the First Age.\n\nSecond Age\n\nThe vast primordial forests in Eriador stood until the middle of this\nage when the Númenóreans began cutting them down to built their fleets\nand fuel their desire for empire and dominion. Then when Sauron declared\nwar in SA 1693 much of the forested area in Eriador was burned to the\nground or extensively damaged.\n\nThird Age\n\nBy the Third Age all that remained of the vast forests of Eriador were\nFangorn forest and the Old Forest both of which were guarded by the Ents\nand Tom Bombadil. When Sauron reestablished himself in TA 1050 and moved\nto Dol Guldur, Greenwood became evil and perilous and was unsafe to\nenter save in secret.\n\nFourth Age and Beyond\n\nWith the defeat of Sauron in the War of the Ring and the clearing of Dol\nGuldur, Mirkwood was freed from evil and Men and Elves worked to restore\nit to its former beauty.

The Valar\nwould have preferred to closed the mountains entirely but, realizing\nthat the elves, even the Vanyar, needed to be able to breath the outside\nair, they kept Calacirya open.\n\nThey also did not want to wholly separate the Vanyar and Ñoldor from the\nTeleri on the coast. The Valar then opened the pass in the side of The\nPelóri and the Noldor and Vanyar entered and resided in the city of\nTirion, which is set right in the middle of the pass. The Teleri did not\nleave the island of Tol Eressëa until much later and even then, they did\nnot enter Valinor but stayed rather on the eastern coast of Aman under\nthe afternoon shadow of The Pelóri in a city named Alqualondë.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Calacirya_ is a Quenyan word that meant 'Cleft of Light'. Earlier forms\nof the word were 'Kalakirya' and 'Kalakilya'. Later forms were and\n'Kalakiryan' and 'Calaciryan'."

    "page_id": "3784",
    "text": "_ON FAIRY-STORIES_ is an essay written by J. R. R. Tolkien that was\npublished as a book.\n\nTolkien originally wrote the essay in 1939 for his lecture on the\nsubject of Fairly Tales in general to an audience at University of St.\nAndrews in Scotland. Afterwards, it was first published within _Essays\nPresented to Charles Williams_ in 1947. It was then subsequently\npublished with _Leaf by Niggle_ in _Tree and Leaf_ as well as in _The\nTolkien Reader_, around 1966. It has since been renewed as an Expanded\nedition (pictured right), edited by Tolkien scholars Verlyn Flieger and\nDouglas Anderson, in 2008.\n\nThe essay contains Tolkien's explanation of his philosophy on fantasy\nand on “faerie”, and thoughts on the crafting of the mythos.\n\n\nSummary\n\nTolkien named the genre _Fairy Stories,_ which he carefully\ndistinguishes from actual “Fairy Tales”. This distinction seems to be\ntwofold. First, he defines _fairy stories_ as not stories about fairies\nor other supernatural beings, but stories about the interaction between\nhumans and those beings. Second, he emphasizes that through the use of\nfantasy, which he equates with fancy and imagination, the author can\nbring the reader to experience a world which is consistent and rational,\nyet utterly strange as well. He calls this “a rare achievement of Art”,\nand notes that it was important to him as a reader: “It was in\nfairy-stories that I first divined the potency of the words, and the\nwonder of things, such as stone, and wood, and iron; tree and grass;\nhouse and fire; bread and wine.”\n\nHaving defined the genre, Tolkien goes on to defend its utility on three\ngrounds. First, suggesting that fairy stories allow the reader to review\nhis or her own world from the “perspective” of a different world. This\nconcept, which shares much in common with cultural relativism, Tolkien\ncalls “recovery”, in the sense that one's unquestioned assumptions might\nbe recovered and changed by an outside perspective. Second, he defends\nfairy stories as offering escapist pleasure to the reader. And third,\nTolkien suggests that fairy stories (can) provide moral or emotional\nconsolation, through their happy ending, which he terms a\n“eucatastrophe”."

    "text": "SMITH OF WOOTTON MAJOR, first published in 1967, is a short story by J.\nR. R. Tolkien.\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe book grew out of an attempt to explain the meaning of “Faery” by\nmeans of a brief story about a cook and his cake. This would have been\npart of a preface to George MacDonald's famous faerie story _The Golden\nKey_. But the story grew from there and became a tale in its own right.\n\nThe most recent edition includes a previously unpublished essay by\nTolkien, explaining the background and just why the elf-king spent so\nlong in Wooton Major. It also explains how the story grew from this\nfirst idea into the published version.\n\nThe book was originally called “THE GREAT CAKE”, but the title was\nchanged to “SMITH OF WOOTTON MAJOR” in an attempt to suggest an early\nwork by P.G. Wodehouse.\n\nIt is not definitely connected to the Middle-earth legendarium. Both\n_Faery_ and Valinor are lands outside of the normal world, but Valinor\ncannot normally be visited by mortals. There are lesser Elven kingdoms\nthat humans can visit and return: Faramir mentions visitors to Lorien.\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe village of Wootton Major is well-known around the countryside for\nits annual festivals, which are particularly famous for their culinary\ndelights. The biggest festival of them all is the Feast of Good\nChildren. This festival is celebrated only once every twenty-four years,\nand the celebrations take the form of a party to which twenty-four\nchildren of the village are invited. The highpoint of the party is the\nGreat Cake, which is remarkable for its hidden magical ingredients.\nWhoever swallows one of these is given the rare gift of an entry into\nthe Land of Faery.\n\nThis year the magic star hidden inside the Great Cake was eaten by a\nblacksmith’s son. The boy did not feel any of its magical properties at\nonce but on the morning of his tenth birthday the star fixed itself on\nhis forehead and marked him as one intimate with the Faeryfolk. This boy\ngrew up to be a blacksmith like his father, but in his free time he\nroamed into the Land of Faery. The star on his forehead protected him\nfrom the evils threatening mortals in that land, and the Folk called him\nStarbrow and told him about their land and its hidden beauties and\ndangers.\n\nThe years passed and it was now time for another Feast of Good Children.\nSmith had had his precious gift for most of his life now and the time\nhad come for it to be passed on to some other child. So he gave up the\nstar, and the mysterious new Master Cook baked it into the festive cake\nonce more.",

There were several\ndifferent types of axes, including single-bladed and double-bladed axes\nas well as throwing axes. Many Dwarves carried more than one Axe. The\nthrowing axe had a foot-long handle and kept most of its weight in the\nblade, to increase the force with which it would hit the target. It had\na range of only ten yards or so and was much smaller than the walking\naxe. A walking axe had a square handle and was about three feet long; it\nhad a single blade so the user could use it as a walking staff. Unlike\ntheir depiction in many fiction settings, double bladed axes (also\ncalled double-bitted axes) are used in logging, while battle axes have\none blade, and sometimes a spike. An Axe could also be used as tool,\nserving multiple purposes.\n\nThe Sindar of the First Age were lightly armed in battle, and used axes\nas well. Some of the Orcs of Mordor and Minas Morgul also used crude\naxes.\n\nHurin used an axe before he was captured by Morgoth's forces.

    "text": "FARMER GILES OF HAM (written in 1947, published in 1949) is a short\nMiddle Earth story written by J. R. R. Tolkien. The story describes a\nseries of encounters between Farmer Giles and a wily Dragons named\nChrysophylax. It is set in a fantasy Britain of long ago, which has\nmythical creatures, medieval knights, and primitive firearms. It is\nhappily anachronistic, and is more like a folk-tale than the sweeping\nepics which Tolkien is better known for. The book was originally\nillustrated by Pauline Baynes.\n\n\nPlot\n\nFarmer Giles was not a hero. He was fat and red-bearded and enjoyed a\nslow, comfortable life. One day a rather deaf and short-sighted giant\nblundered on to his land. Farmer Giles managed to scare him away with a\nblunderbluss shot in its general direction. The people of the village\ncheered: Farmer Giles was a hero. His reputation spread far and wide\nacross the kingdom. Giles was rewarded by the King of the Middle\nKingdom, with a sword named Caudimordax or “Tailbiter”, a powerful\nweapon against dragons.\n\nThe giant reports to its monstrous friends that there are no more\nknights, just stinging flies (actually scrap metal from Giles'\nblunderbuss), in the Middle Kingdom. This prompts a dragon, Chrysophylax\nDives, to investigate the area and everyone turns to the accidental hero\nFarmer Giles to deal with it.\n\nThe story makes light of the great dragon-slaying traditions. The\nknights who are supposed to do the job are useless fops more intent on\n“precedence and etiquette” than on noticing huge dragon footprints\nlittering the landscape. “Giles” is also an interesting commentary on\nhow people react to danger. Heroes aren't simply called for, they are\ndemanded and hapless farmers can be forced to be heroes.\n\nThe Latin names and references imply that Giles is a Briton, a late\ngeneration remnant of the old empire after the decline of the western\nauthority of the Romans. All the Giles place-names are supposed to occur\nrelatively close to Oxford, along the Thames or on the route from London\nto Oxford.\n\nAmong the jokes is a question put to “the four wise clerks of Oxenford”;\nTolkien then quotes from the Oxford English Dictionary, on which he had\nworked. The phrase “wise clerk of Oxenford” is also a reference to\nChaucer's Clerk.\n\n“Farmer Giles of Ham” is sometimes published in an omnibus edition with\n“Smith of Wootton Major”, another Tolkien novella with illustrations by\nPauline Baynes.\n\nIt is rumored that farmer Giles in really Hamwise Gamgee but it is very\nunlikely since Hamwise did not believe in Dragons.",

In these days, there\nwere no known dwarf or orc colonies in the hills or in the mountains and\ndragons were not known to have lived in this area at this time, but\ntribes of Silvan elves and later Mannish tribes were known to be living\nin or near the Northeast.\n\nAfter the War of Wrath when the Beleriand fell beneath the waves, the\norcs and the remaining dragons fled into up into the mountains and hide\nand created hidden realms, and became an ever increasing threat.\nStarting at around TA 1980 when the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm were driven\nout of by the Balrog, dwarves began moving into the Grey Mountains and\nlater into the Lonely Mountain and then into the Iron Hills. Men also\nbegan establishing themselves in Dale and Laketown and good relations\nbetween the dwarves and men prospered for many years. However, when the\ndragon Smaug heard of the happy prosperity of the two peoples and their\ntreasures, he descended down upon the two realms and destroyed them.

The Yule celebrations lasted six days in\ntotal, including two days before and two days after the Yuledays. This\nsix-day period was called Yuletide. It was a time of feasting and\nmerriment.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, it was feared that the Yule feasts would be\nrather meager due to shortages of provisions in the Shire. But large\nstores of food and beer were found in the tunnels of Michel Delving and\nin the quarries at Scary and in other places, so the Yuledays were a\ntime of great cheer.\n\nThe Elves did not have a celebration at midwinter.

This was divided into 8766 six-day\n“weeks”, or _enquier_. They also recognised the solar year, which was\ncalled a _coranar_ (“sun-round”) or _loa_ (“growth”). In Rivendell, the\n_loa_ began on the spring equinox and was divided into six “months” or\nseasons, as follows.\n\n  QUENYA NAME   SINDARIN NAME   ENGLISH TRANSLATION   DURATION\n  ------------- --------------- --------------------- ----------\n  _tuilë_       _ethuil_        Spring                54 days\n  _lairë_       _laer_          Summer                72 days\n  _yávië_       _iavas_         Autumn                54 days\n  _quellë_      _firith_        Fading                54 days\n  _hrívë_       _rhîw_          Winter                72 days\n  _coirë_       _echuir_        Stirring              54 days\n\nFive other days, two between _coirë_ and _tuilë_ (called _Yestare_ and\n_Mettare_) and three between _yávië_ and _hrívë_ (called the _enderi_),\nmeant the calendar added up to 365 days. Irregularities were allowed for\nby adding another three days every twelve years, except the last year of\na _yén_.\n\nThe year (_loa_) begins on March 21st. That day is called _Yestare_. The\nnext day begins the season of _tuile_. _Tuil'e_ ends on May 14th.\n_Laire _begins on May 15th and ends on July 25th. _Yavie_ begins on July\n26th and ends on September 17th. The next three days are the _enderi_\n(September 18th, 19th, and 20th). _Quelle_begins on September 21st and\nends on November 13th. Then'' Hrive ''starts on the 14th. It ends on\nJanuary 24th. _Coire _begins on January 25th and ends on March 19th. The\nnext day is ''Mettare. '' These dates only work until the enderi have\nbeen doubled. Once every twelve years the elves would double the\n''enderi ''to replace having a leap year.\n\n\nNúmenórean Calendar\n\nThe calendar adopted by the Men of Middle-earth was called the King's\nReckoning, and was very similar to our own. It had a week of seven days,\nand divided the 365-day year of the Elves into twelve months (_astar_),\nten with 30 days and two with 31. Also like our calendar, the Númenórean\nyear began in midwinter. They retained the two days between the end of\none year and the start of the next (_mettarë_ and _yestarë_), but\nreduced the mid-year days to one (_loëndë_, essentially adding the other\ntwo to the mid-year “long months”). Leap years had two mid-year days. In\nthe Second and Third Ages, years were reckoned from the beginning of the\nAge.\n\nVarious irregularities occurred in this calendar, especially following\nthe Downfall. In TA 2060, Mardil Voronwë revised the calendar, and the\nnew version became the Steward's Reckoning. The months of Steward's\nReckoning all had 30 days, and there were two additional “extra” days at\nthe equinoxes, _tuilérë_ and _yáviérë_. The five extra days (the\nequinoxes, midsummer and two at midwinter) were holidays.\n\nIn TA 3021, the Reunited Kingdom adopted a New Reckoning, which began\nthe year on the spring equinox, as in the Elven calendar.\n\nThe months of the Reckonings were in Quenya (or Sindarin among the\nDúnedain) and were:\n\n  QUENYA NAME   SINDARIN NAME\n  ------------- ---------------\n  Narvinyë      Narwain\n  Nénimë        Nínui\n  Súlìmë        Gwaeron\n  Víressë       Gwirith\n  Lótessë       Lothron\n  Náríë         Nórui\n  Cermië        Cerveth\n  Urimë         Urui\n  Yavannië      Ivanneth\n  Narquelië     Narbeleth\n  Hísimë        Hithui\n  Ringarë       Girithron\n\n\nHobbit Calendar\n\n(More detail can be found under Shire Calendar)\n\nThe Hobbits, who had adopted the King's Reckoning, altered it in a\ndifferent way from the Steward's Reckoning. Like the Steward's\nReckoning, they had twelve months of thirty days, and five holidays\noutside the months. However, they had three “extra” days in midsummer\nand two in midwinter, similar to the Elven calendar. In the Shire the\nthree days of midsummer were called Lithedays, and the two days of\nmidwinter were the Yuledays. In leap years, the extra day was added to\nthe Lithedays and called Overlithe. The other innovation in the Shire\ncalendar was to make Midsummer's Day (and the Overlithe) outside the\nweek, as well as the month, meaning the days of the week would not\nchange in relation to the days of the year. The Shire Reckoning is the\ncalendar used in the _Red Book of Westmarch_, and hence in _The Lord of\nthe Rings_. It counts from the founding of the Shire in TA 1600.\n\nThe Hobbit names of the months came from names used in Anduin in\nantiquity, and their meanings were often obscure or forgotten. They\nwere:\n\n  SHIRE NAME      BREE NAME\n  --------------- ------------------------\n  2 Yule          2 Yule\n  Afteryule       Frery\n  Solmath         Solmath\n  Rethe           Rethe\n  Astron          Chithing\n  Thrimidge       Thrimidge\n  Forelithe       Lithe\n  1 Lithe         First Summerday\n  Midyear's Day   Second Summerday\n  Overlithe       Third Summerday\n  2 Lithe         Third/Fourth Summerday\n  Afterlithe      Mede\n  Wedmath         Wedmath\n  Halimath        Harvestmath\n  Winterfilth     Wintring\n  Blotmath        Blooting\n  Foreyule        Yulemath\n  1 Yule          1 Yule\n\n(Given the decidedly Old English sound of these names, it can be assumed\nthat this is J.R.R.

A drawing of the Inscription appears in Book I,\nChapter 2 of _The Fellowship of the Ring_, “The Shadow of the Past”. A\ntransliteration appears in Book II, Chapter 2, “The Council of Elrond”,\nwhere the inscription is read by Gandalf (listen to the inscription):\n\n  _Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh\n  burzum-ishi krimpatul._\n\n\n\nThese words, in the Black Speech of Mordor, are physically painful to\nall the free people of middle earth, except hobbits, who are especially\nresistant to evil. At the Council of Elrond, most probably because of\nthe power and the shadow they bring (the Shadow being the more harmful\nto the elves), Elrond is seen looking very annoyed when the inscription\nis read.

When Isildur had cut the ring from Sauron's hand, it was\nburning hot, and so Isildur was able to transcribe the inscription\nbefore it faded.\n\nWhen Gandalf subsequently heated the ring that Bilbo had found and\npassed on to Frodo, the inscription appeared, leaving him in no doubt\nthat it was the One Ring.\n"

    "text": "The Valar and Eldar now fully understood the extent of Melkor's\ntreachery. Fëanor, upon learning of his father's murder and the theft of\nhis prized Silmarils, named Melkor “Morgoth”, or “Black Foe of the\nWorld” (literally “Black Enemy”). Now King of the Ñoldor, Fëanor\ndelivered the most impassioned speech ever given in Arda, which he\nunwittingly filled with Morgoth's taint. He railed against the Great\nEnemy, but because of Morgoth's influence, he also blamed the Valar for\nMorgoth's deeds. He persuaded most his people that because the Valar had\nabandoned them, the Ñoldor must follow him to Middle-earth and fight\nMorgoth. Fëanor then swore the terrible Oath of Fëanor which all seven\nof his sons also proclaimed, vowing to fight anyone and everyone —\nwhether Elf, Man, Maia, or Valar — who withheld the Silmarils, and\ninvoking even Ilúvatar as a witness. This became known as the Oath of\nFëanor and later the cause for great tragedy among his seven sons.\n\nSeeking a way to get to Middle-earth, he went to the shores of Aman,\nwhere the seafaring Teleri lived, and demanded the use of their ships.\nThe Teleri refused, and in response, Fëanor and his armed and\nimpassioned Ñoldor attacked the lightly-armed Teleri, destroyed their\nsettlements and seized the ships. This act is known as the First\nKinslaying.\n\nIn repentance of this act, Finarfin, Finwë's third son, took his host\nand turned back. They were accepted by the Valar, and Finarfin ruled as\nHigh-King of the Noldor in Valinor.\n\nThere were not enough ships to carry all of the Ñoldor across the sea,\nso Fëanor and his sons led the first group. Upon arriving at Losgar, in\nthe land of Lamoth, in the far west of Beleriand, where and\nUngoliant had passed not long before, they decided to burn the ships and\nleave the followers of Fingolfin behind. However, Fëanor accidentally\nleft his son Amras in the ships, and he was burned alive. The earth\nbeing flat in those days, the remaining Ñoldor saw the flames, and\nperceived that if they were to go to Middle-earth[[, they had no choice\nbut to cross the [[Helcaraxë. This they did under the leadership of\nFingolfin, and suffered great losses along the way, which greatly added\nto the animosity they had for Fëanor and his sons.\n\nLearning of the Ñoldor's arrival, Morgoth summoned his armies from his\nfortress of Angband and attacked Fëanor's encampment in Mithrim. This\nbattle was called the Battle under the Stars, or _Dagor-nuin-Giliath_,\nfor the Sun and Moon had not yet been made. The Ñoldor managed to win\nthe battle, and disperse Morgoth's armies. Fëanor, still in a great\nrage, pressed on toward Angband with his sons. He came even within sight\nof Angband, but was ambushed by a force of Balrogs, with few elves about\nhim. He fought mightily, hewing even after receiving several wounds from\nGothmog, captain of the Balrogs. His sons came upon the Balrogs with\ngreat force of elves, and were able to drive them off. However, as\nFëanor was being escorted off the battlefield, he knew his wounds were\nmortal. He cursed Angband thrice, but with the eyes of death, he knew\nthat his elves, unaided, would never throw down the dark towers. At the\nmoment of his death the passing of his fiery spirit reduced his body to\nashes.\n\nHis sons were still bound by the Oath to recover the Silmarils, which\nwould determine the events of Middle-earth during the First Age."

In the world of Arda, named towers were prominent, symbolic, and\nsometimes held great character.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the Two Trees\n\nWhilst dwelling on the island of Almaren, the two most prominent towers\nin all of Arda were Helcar and Ringol which held the great lamps of\nIlluin and Ormal that lit the world in its youth. They both were thrown\ndown and destroyed by Melkor, causing a great change to the world.\n\nBefore the Sun and Moon\n\nSuccessfully reaching Aman, the Elves built Tirion where stood the\nMindon Eldaliéva, which dominated the city and symbolized elven glory in\nthe far West.\n\nFirst Age\n\nWhen the Noldor returned to Middle-earth in pursuit of Morgoth, many\ntowers were built for the observation of the enemy in the North. The\ntallest and most prominent being Minas Tirth built by Finrod to watch\nthe northern plain of Ard-galen, until it was conquered by Sauron.\n\nSecond Age\n\nEarly\n\nAs the Beleriand and its great civilizations were destroyed at the end\nof the First Age, the only great towers in Arda were located in Eldamar\nand Númenor. The elves of Tol Eressëa built a great tower in the eastern\npart of the island used for observing the sea. Men of Numenor yearning\nfor the west could see its lights from both the haven of Andúnië and\nfrom the decks of their great ships.\n\nLater\n\nAfter Numenor's destruction and the removal of Aman from the circles of\nthe world, the surviving Dúnedain of the Realms in Exile built towers of\ntheir own most of which held a Palantír, which they used to order their\nkingdoms and to communicate with each other during times of strife. In\nthe northwest lied the white towers of Arnor. Elostirion, built by\nGil-galad in honor of Elendil was its tallest and most prominent.\nNortheast of it was the tower of Annúminas in the capital, and further\nto the southeast was the tower of Amon Sûl on Weathertop.\n\nIn far southeast of Amon Sûl was the tower Orthanc in Isengard or\nAngrenost which in those days belonged exclusively to Gondor. Then,\nthere were the great towers of Gondor proper in Minas Anor, Osgiliath,\nand Minas Ithil all of which held one of the seeing stones in those\ndays.\n\nThird Age\n\nDuring the turbulent times that came with the Third Age, many of the\ngreat towers of the Dúnedain were destroyed, abandoned or occupied by\nthe enemy. Of the most infamous were Orthanc, the Tower of Cirith Ungol,\nand the Towers of the Teeth some of which were originally built by the\nDúnedain after the war of the Last Alliance to keep watch on Mordor, but\nwere abandoned and left behind due to the waning of the kingdoms of men\nand the Great Plague. Orthanc was occupied by Saruman and soon became a\nplace of evil rivaling Sauron. Only the Tower of Ecthelion remained good\nand was seen as a symbol of hope.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring and the restoration of the great kingdoms of\nmen and that of peace, the great towers of the enemy fell and were\ndestroyed. Orthanc still stood and was for a time ruled by Treebeard\nuntil he gave it up. Barad-dûr, the ultimate stronghold of the Dark Lord\nSauron, had been the highest tower in all Middle-earth during this age.\n\nFourth Age and Beyond\n\nOrthanc remained into King Elessar's time, and was found to contain many\nof his ancestor's heirlooms and treasures hoarded up and hidden by\nSaruman. It is unknown whether new towers were erected by the men of the\nReunited Kingdom.\n\n\nNote\n\n“The Two Towers” could refer to any two of the following towers:\n\n-   Orthanc\n-   Minas Tirith\n-   Minas Morgul\n-   Barad-dûr"

    "title": "Oath of Fëanor",
    "page_id": "4267",
    "text": "The OATH OF FËANOR was an oath taken by Fëanor and his seven sons to\nnon-negotiable enmity against any person who would take a Silmaril or\nkeep it from them. After Morgoth killed Finwe and stole the Silmarilli,\nthis oath became the cause of some of the most terrible and tragic\ncrimes in the history of Arda.\n\n\nHistory\n\nLearning of his father's death at the hands of Morgoth, Fëanor went back\nto Tirion, breaking the exile set by the Valar. At Tirion, Fëanor gave\nan impassioned speech in which he convinced the vast majority of the\nÑoldor to follow him to Middle-earth to wrest the Silmarils back from\nMorgoth and avenge Finwë. At the end of his speech, furious and ever\nprideful, Fëanor swore the dreadful oath to Eru, calling Manwë and Varda\nin witness. This oath saw him pledge, on pain of calling upon himself\nthe Everlasting Darkness, to pursue with violence any who would keep or\nhold a Silmaril from him, no matter who it was, and no matter what the\nreason or circumstance. His seven sons leaped to his side and swore the\noath with him. \n\nFëanor died soon after his return to Middle-Earth but the remaining\noath-takers, his sons, lived on in relative harmony with the Eldar of\nBeleriand, in no small part thanks to the diplomatic skill of Maedhros.\n For the greater part of the First Age, the oath kept the sons of\nFëanor united in one cause: to defeat Morgoth and retrieve the\nSilmarils, for so long as the jewels remained in the hands of the Dark\nLord, they were irretrievable by force. And so the oath slumbered, as by\nfighting Morgoth, even hopelessly, the brothers were still technically\nattempting to fulfill it.\n\nHowever, the terrible dangers of the oath became apparent when Beren and\nLúthien managed to recover one of the jewels from Morgoth. Now that\nthe jewel was no longer in Morgoth's hands, it became possible for the\nbrothers to retrieve it and genuinely fulfill the oath. Beren gave the\nSilmaril to King Thingol of Doriath who had demanded it as a bride-price\nfor his daughter, believing that Beren could not possibly retrieve one.\nWhen the sons of Fëanor learned of this, they demanded its surrender.\nHowever, Thingol was insulted by the demand and had begun to lust for\nthe Silmaril. He refused their request, and Curufin and Celegorm openly\nthreatened to destroy Doriath. This threat was the cause of considerable\nturmoil and resulted in much grief, for Maedhros was attempting at the\ntime to forge a coalition between the various Elven kingdoms to engage\nin a final, decisive strike against Morgoth's power. The threat caused\nThingol to close his borders and send no aid to the military alliance.\nThough the Elves would not have had the power in any circumstance to\noverthrow Morgoth, the loss of Thingol's aid proved detrimental to the\nalliance. After the Elven defeat during Nírnaeth Arnoediad, a series of\nunfortunate events led to the death of King Thingol and the\ndisappearance of Queen Melian, who returned to Valinor in grief. With\nher departure, the Girdle of Melian, which had protected Doriath from\nattack, faded. Beren and Lúthien's son, Dior, was crowned King of\nDoriath. He likewise refused to surrender the jewel, and the brothers\nattacked Doriath and sacked the halls of the Sindar, committing the\nsecond kin-slaying. However, the Silmaril escaped the destruction of\nDoriath and the oath drove the sons onwards. Eventually, they learned\nthat it it had come into the possession of Elwing, who dwelt near the\nmouths of Sirion. They attacked the and slaughtered the defenseless\nexiles of Gondolin and Doriath, committing the third and most terrible\nkin-slaying.\n\nBut the Silmaril escaped them again and was borne by Eärendil into the\nWest. That Silmaril was forever lost to the sons of Fëanor but two more\nremained in the crown of Morgoth. With the complete destruction of the\nElven kingdoms of Beleriand, it seemed impossible that these would ever\nsee the light of day again. However, Eärendil convinced the Valar to\ntake pity on the Elves and Edain under Morgoth's power, and initiated\nthe War of Wrath. This war saw Morgoth's power utterly overthrown, and\nthe two remaining Silmarils were wrested from him. However, most of the\nsons of Fëanor had been slain in battle, and no few of them during the\nkinslayings by their victims. The only brothers to survive the third and\nfinal kinslaying were Maedhros and Maglor. They demanded the Silmarils\nfrom Eönwë, the standard bearer of Manwë, but because of the wicked\ndeeds they had committed in the name of retrieving it, they were denied.\nBy now sick at heart of keeping the dreadful oath, neither particularly\nwanted anything more to do with the Silmarils, and Maglor openly opposed\nattempting to retrieve them. However, Maedhros convinced him to help him\nlay hands upon the jewels, claiming that because of the oath, they\nsimply had no choice. They snuck in to the camp of the victorious Host\nof the West, slew the guard around the jewels, and retrieved them. The\ncamp was roused against them, and they prepared themselves to die\ndefending their claim. But Eönwë simply permitted them to leave\nunharmed. However, due to the terrible deeds committed by the brothers\nin their retrieval of the Silmarils they found they could not handle the\nSilmarils without enduring searing pain. The two brothers parted and in\nhis anguish Maedhros threw himself and his Silmaril into a fiery chasm.\nMaglor on the other hand tossed his Silmaril into the sea and was said\nto wander the coast forever after lamenting his loss and pain.\n\n\nThe Oath\n\nThe Oath itself, as given in _Morgoth's Ring_, is as follows:\n\n “Be he foe or friend, be he foul or clean Brood of Morgoth or bright\nVala, Elda or Maia or Aftercomer, Man yet unborn upon Middle-earth,\nNeither law, nor love, nor league of swords, Dread nor danger, not Doom\nitself Shall defend him from Fëanáro, and Fëanáro’s kin, Whoso hideth or\nhoardeth, or in hand taketh, Finding keepeth or afar casteth A Silmaril.\nThis swear we all… Death we will deal him ere Day’s ending, Woe unto\nworld’s end! Our word hear thou, Eru Allfather! To the everlasting\nDarkness doom us if our deed faileth… On the holy mountain hear in\nwitness and our vow remember, Manwë and Varda!\""

His dwellings were built south by the feet of the mountains of\nValinor, upon the confines of the realm. Aulë had made Lorien's halls\nof mist gathered beyond Avathar upon the Shadowy Seas. His hall was\ngreat and dimly lit and had wide gardens which wandered marvelously\nabout, winding near to the feet of Telperion whose shining lit them. The\ngardens were full of labyrinths and mazes, for Yavanna had given Lórien\na great wealth of yew trees and cedars, and of pines that exuded drowsy\naromas in the dusk, and these hung over deep pools. Bright glowworms\ncrept about their borders and Varda had set stars within their depths\nfor the pleasure of Irmo. His Maiar servants sang wonderfully in these\ngardens and the scent of nightflowers and the songs of sleepy\nnightingales filled them with great loveliness. There too grew the\npoppies glowing red in the dusk, and those the Valar called Fumellar;\nthe flowers of sleep. In the middle of his gardens was set a ring of\nshadowy cypress reaching high above the cauldron Silindrin where Irmo,\ngazing upon it, saw many visions of mystery pass upon its face. In the\ngardens were also a lake called Lorellin, and in the lake was an isle\nwhereupon Estë slept.\n\nBeing the most beautiful place in Arda, the Gardens of Lòrien were set\nupon a unique natural background containing forest groves, flowers,\nsilver willows, fountains, and lakes; the overall color scheme seems to\nhave been silver. Within the Gardens was Lorellin, the tree-shadowed\nlake where, on a small island at its center, sleeps Estë. Not far from\nits shores is a small dwelling.

During his sojourn in Tol Eressëa he learned\nfrom them the true and ancient history of the Creation, of the Gods, of\nthe Elves, and of England.\n\nEngland (ANGOL, LUTHANY, LUTHIEN, LEITHIAN, LEITHIEN, INGOLONDE,\nENGALAND, ONGULCYNNE) is an island of Arda (Earth) in some versions of\nTolkien's mythology. In general it lies next to Ireland (Isle of Ivren,\nHibernia, Erin) and is located within Britain (aka Leithian, Luthian,\nLuthien).Which is entering considering that Leithien/Luthien had several\nmeanings for Tolkien, including name of elf princes, an alternate name\nfor England, and also “release/release from bondage” (see Lay of\nLeithian).\n\nThe geographical context of England changes depending on the version\nwithin development. Sometimes Ælfwine leaves from England (and this is\nthe case in much of the late stories concerning the mariner and\nPengolod).\n\nIn some stories England lies off the coast of the Outer Lands (Great\nLands of the East/Middle-earth) where it was brought there by the Gods,\nor was shattered during the war of the Gods (creating several islands\nincluding nearby Ireland). But became home of elves. In some stories\nthis island is associated with Tol Eressëa and is located to the far\nWest, in sight of Valinor.\n\nSometimes its just an island off the main coast of Middle-earth (perhaps\nwest of Forodwaith. But with Middle-earth as seen as the north continent\nof Earth (_Arda_) in an imaginary period of the Earth's past (Tolkien\nplaced the end of the Third Age at about 6,000 years before his own\ntime), in the sense of a “secondary or sub-creational reality”.\nIts general position is reminiscent of Europe, with the environs of the\nShire intended to be reminiscent of England (more specifically, the West\nMidlands, with Hobbiton set at the same latitude as Oxford).\n\nWhile Tolkien never fully dropped the idea of Arda being 'earth' even\ninto the late 1970s, he became less concerned with maintaining\nconsistent 'geography' (though he did experiment with both flat earth\nand round earth versions of his tales, and in later sources the\nconnections between locations in Arda and on modern earth became more\nabstract (continental Hobbiton and Rivendell for example being part of\nEngland, roughly the latitude of Oxford, yet not being on an island, and\nMinas Tirith being at the latitude of modern Florence, and Pelargir\nlocated close to the same spot as ancient Troy).\n"

Sauron, however, was much more powerful, and\nkilled first Gil-galad with the heat of his hand, and then Elendil, as\nElrond, Círdan, and Isildur helplessly watched. As Elendil fell, his\ngreat sword Narsil broke beneath him. But Sauron had been mortally\nwounded in the battle, and when Isildur cut the One Ring from Sauron's\nbody his spirit fled.\n\nAfter the battle, Sauron's body was broken, the tower of Barad-dûr\ncollapsed (without the Ring's destruction the foundations remained), and\nthe Orc hosts were in disarray. Elrond led Isildur into the heart of\nMount Doom, where the One Ring was forged, and the only place it could\nbe destroyed. However, he claimed it for his own, which led to his\ndeath.\n\nGondor later reoccupied Minas Ithil and Ithilien, and set watchtowers at\nthe Black Gate, and the pass of Cirith Ungol. However, years of neglect,\nand the Kin-strife led these areas to be captured by the Nazgûl, with\nMinas Ithil, later Minas Morgul, falling to the Witch-king.\n\nIsildur's father, brother, and Gil-galad were killed in the Siege of\nBarad-dûr.",

Ten Oldbuck Thains followed, until _Gordenhad Oldbuck_, the\neleventh Thain, crossed into Buckland over the river Brandywine, passing\nthe Thainship to the Took clan.\n\nGordenhad renamed himself BRANDYBUCK, and began delving the great smials\nof Brandy Hall. Around the hill was built the village of _Bucklebury_.\n\nThe Brandybucks formed a powerful dynasty, which became mostly\nindependent of the Shire, although Buckland remained nominally a part of\nit. They were seen as 'odd folk' by the other Hobbits of the Shire\nbecause they locked their doors at night (because of the exposure to the\nOld Forest). It should also be noted that the Brandybucks were not only\nthe most wary hobbit clan, but also one of the most organized in matters\nof militia. After the Ringwraiths invaded Frodo's house in Buckland, the\nmilitia was roused with the call of “Fear, Fire, Foes, Awake!” the\nmilitia of Buckland arrived, though the Ringwraiths escaped by riding\nthrough the front barricades of Buckland. This proves that the\nBrandybucks were not idle in matters of defense, perhaps due to their\nproximity to the Old Forest, and the attack of the White Wolves over the\nfrozen Brandywine River. Two instances in which the Brandybucks were\ncapable of fending off the rare (Though Minor) dangers that threatened\nthe shire.\n\n\nMasters of Buckland\n\nThe head of the family was the _Master of Buckland_, one of the\nofficials of the Shire. Gordenhad Brandybuck founded this office. Like\nthe Thain and Warden of Westmarch, the Master had only nominal\nauthority. The authority of the Master also extended across the\nBrandywine into the Marish of the Eastfarthing, due to the close\nproximity and the amount of business between the two areas.\n\n\n“Brandybuck” as a translation\n\nIt should be noted that the name _Brandybuck_ is only a translation of\nthe original Westron BRANDAGAMBA, _Marchbuck_. In keeping with the\nconcept that _The Lord of the Rings_ was derived from the translated Red\nBook of Westmarch, Tolkien translated all its Westron words into English\n— including the names of characters.

When they eventually met the\nSindarin elves, they made alliance with them and trade pacts were forged\nand the road was no doubt used to facilitate trade between them.\n\nIt is possible that during the late Second Age it was used to carry the\narmies of the Last Alliance, which may add to the evidence that it once\nhad a bridge running across it that eventually rotted away, thus\ncrossers had to rely on a boat to reach the other side of the road.\n\nAfter Sauron's occupation of Dol Guldur, the forest of Mirkwood became\nmore and more dark and dangerous, so most chose not to travel upon it\nfor fear of being attacked. Most that did travel on it lost sight of it\nand usually never found their way back onto it again, thus never finding\ntheir way out of the forest according to Gandalf and Beorn."

The phial emits a brilliant light in darkness.\n\nFor Samwise Gamgee - ''Earth from Galadriel's Orchard and a Mallorn Seed\n''- These are contained in a small box of grey wood with a silver G-rune\non the lid. He uses it to replant trees in the Shire after the Scouring\nof the Shire. In the movie, Sam instead receives Elven rope. This rope\nis much stronger than other rope. In the movie, as in the book, the rope\nallows itself to be retrieved from its anchorage with a small tug, due\nto the Elvish skill at rope-making.\n\nFor Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took - _Silver Belt with Gold\nFlower-Shaped Clasp_ - a belt favoured by the Elves of Lothlorien. In\nthe movie, Galadriel presents them with daggers. \n\nFor Aragorn - _Elven Scabbard_- A magical scabbard, any sword sheathed\nin this scabbard will never break. And _Elessar the Elfstone_ - A green\ngem set in a silver eagle shaped brooch, left for him by Arwen. In the\nmovie, Aragorn does not receive either of these, as Arwen has already\ngiven him the film's equivalent gem; Elrond will later present him a\nscabbard with Andúril, though no indication is given that it is magical.\nInstead, Celeborn gives him a curved Elvish hunting knife.\n\nFor Legolas - _Bow of the Galadhrim with\nArrows_ - A great bow crafted deep in Lothlorien and strung with\nelf-hair.\n\nFor Gimli - _Three Strands of Galadriel's hair_ - Overwhelmed by\nGaladriel's great beauty, Gimli could think of nothing else he wanted\nbut a single strand of her hair. Galadriel gave him three. Gimli wished\nto encase this gift in imperishable crystal, as an heirloom of his house\nand a sign of good will between the Dwarves and Elves.\n\nFor Boromir - A solid gold belt crafted in Lórien, shaped like linked\ngolden leaves.\n\nFor all the Fellowship of the Ring (characters) - _Elven Cloaks_ - It is\nworth note that The Fellowship received Elven cloaks from Galadriel\nwhich helped hide them from unfriendly eyes. The cloaks were personally\nwoven by Galadriel and her maidens. The brooches were in the form of a\ngreen leaf veined with silver. The only notable exception to those who\ndidn't receive a cloak was Gandalf, who at the time, was presumed dead\nat the hands of Durin's Bane. In the film, after defeating the Balrog\nand returning to the world of the living, Gandalf appears in Fangorn\nwith a brooched cloak, implying that he traveled to Lorien before\njoining up with scattered members of the Fellowship."

But as the Shire was a\npeaceful place, their only purpose was protecting the Shire from\ntrespassers. They were also possibly responsible for deputizing hobbits\ninto the Bounders service who patrolled the borders.\n\nWhen Lotho Sackville-Baggins ruled the Shire under Saruman during the\nWar of the Ring, he took personal control of the Shirriffs service under\nthe title “Chief Shirriff”. The Shirriffs were increased in number, many\nagainst their will, and those that already were appointed couldn't quit;\nbut some liked it or even signed up, and organized into troops or\ncompanies such as the First Eastfarthing Troop and supported by the\nRuffians.

Their orders during these troubled times were to arrest\nanyone who broke the rules.\n\nWhen the Shire was freed by the return of Frodo and company, the\nShirriffs were returned to their original numbers and purpose.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe term _Shirriff_ is most likely based upon “Shire Reeve”, the\nAnglo-Saxon term that eventually gave rise to the word “Sheriff” in\nmodern English. Shire being analogous to “county” and “reeve” being\nan English term for an appointed official who represents a landlord.\n\n\nKnown Shirriffs\n\n-   Tobias Hornblower\n-   Lotho Sackville-Baggins\n-   Broncho Stonecrow\n-   Robin Smallburrow"

This Dwarven writing system utilizes runes and glyphs\nwhen written. \n\nDwarf Runes were first created by the elven loremaster Daeron of Doriath\nand were called Cirth or Certar Daeron. Daeron was inspired by the\nTengwar script of Fëanor and wanted to create a new script for his\nSindar kin. The dwarves learned the runes from the elves and adapted\nthem for their own language Khuzdûl. The letters are thin and angular\nfor they were designed for cutting or scratching on wood, stone, or\nmetal. By the Third Age only the dwarves made regular use of them. The\nCirth alphabet originally had nineteen characters which was sufficient\nfor the Sindarin language. More were later added by the Noldor of\nEregion to make it easier to express certain subtle sounds in their\nlanguage. This full expansion of the script is generally called\nAngerthas Daeron or Angerthas Eregion. After the destruction of Eregion\nthe elves generally ceased to use Cirth at all. Dwarves made their own\nvariations of the script called Angerthas Moria and Angerthas Erebor.\n\nSome dwarves knew a secret way of writing runes called Moon letters.\nThese runes were written with a silver pen and could only be seen under\nthe light of the moon. With the more advanced forms of Moon letters it\nhad to be a moon of the same shape and season as the day when the runes\nwere written.\n\nThe runes of the dwarves were adapted by Tolkien from the Anglo-Saxon\nand Scandinavian rune scripts.\n\n\n\nKhuzdul.gif|This is the Angerthas Moria, There are 4 characters that do\nnot appear in this chart, the characters for TH, another for E, the\ncharacter for NG, and the character for OO Runes.JPG"

Around his twentieth year, as he\nwalked in the woods singing a part of the Lay of Lúthien, he witnessed\nthe beauty of Arwen for the first time, clad in a mantle of silver and\nblue. Mistaking her for Lúthien, he called to her by that name, and,\nfrom that moment on, loved only her. Gilraen warned Aragorn of the folly\nof his love for Arwen, a high-born Elf such as she was. Aragorn soon\nleft Rivendell, and for thirty years fought against Sauron on whatever\nfront which was deemed necessary.\n\nIn his forty-ninth year of life, after years of strife and toil, he\nwished, once again, to be at peace. He came into Lórien, not knowing\nthat Arwen also was there, and stayed with her for a season. “And thus\nit was that Arwen first beheld him again after their long parting; and\nas he came walking towards her under the trees of Caras Galadhon laden\nwith flowers of gold, her choice was made and her doom appointed.” On\nCerin Amroth, in the midst of Lórien they plighted their troth looking\ntoward the shadow of the east and the twilight of the west.\n\nAfter The War of the Ring, Arwen and Aragorn were married and spent\nsix-score years in bliss. As Aragorn felt his life drawing to a close,\nhe came to Arwen, saying, “In sorrow we must go, but not in despair.\nBehold! we are not bound for ever to the circles of the world, and\nbeyond them is more than memory.”\n\nAfter he passed from the world in the House of the Kings, she bid\nfarewell to Eldarion and her daughters, and went out of Minas Tirith to\nLórien and, “dwelt there alone under the fading trees until winter\ncame.” Sometime before the Spring she laid herself down upon Cerin\nAmroth, and there she would lie until the world's ending."

Tolkien.\n\n\nIn Middle-earth\n\nDwarves\n\nOnly seen by some of the members of Thorin and Company, in _The Hobbit._\n\nElves\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Elven archers from Lórien use large bows of Mallorn wood strung with\nelf-hair. Their arrows were almost four feet long and usually made of\nash with a tip made of gold and shaped like a Mallorn leaf. They used a\nspiral method of fletching (attaching feathers to the arrow shaft), thus\nmaking their arrows more accurate, up to a quarter mile.\n\nLegolas was the most renowned archer throughout the Third Age. Earlier\nin his journey with the Fellowship of the Ring, he used a bow from\nMirkwood, and it was later replaced by the bow of the Galadhrim Lady\nGaladriel gave him.\n\nGondorian\n\n\n\nThe Gondorian army contains units of archers who use a longbow. The bows\nare made of heartwood, about 68 inches tall. The arrows are about 28\ninches long with four-inch steel tips. They are accurate up to 200\nyards. The longbowmen of the army wear their quiver (the case that holds\nthe arrows) on their hips rather than on their backs like most archers,\nsuch as Legolas and Haldir.\n\nRangers of Ithilien\n\nThe Rangers of Ithilien were primarily archers. They used a simple\nlongbow, often made of yew, likely up to 80 inches in length. Their\narrows would have averaged about 28 inches in length with a steel tip\nwith consistent accuracy up to 200 yards.\n\nRohirrim\n\nRohan included archers in its militia. They used shortbows, possibly\nbecause they fought mounted on horses and a longer bow might get in the\nway. The shortbows were much less powerful than those used by their\nallies, having probably a range of only 125 yards. Their arrows were\nunique in having a cutout in the heads; this cut down on weight & the\namount of metal used while still allowing the arrowheads to have a\nlarger surface area, which would cause a larger wound. Another unique\naspect of the arrows was that they were fletched with leather.\n\n_Note: Information comes from “The Lord of the Rings: Weapons and\nWarfare” by Chris Smith._\n\nHaradrim and Easterlings\n\n\n\nThe Haradrim (Southrons) were also skilled archers, along with their\nallies the Easterlings. The Haradrim were masters of archery and had\nexpert snipers positioned on the feared Mumakil. Their bows were short,\npossibly made of composite materials and by the time of the War of the\nRing, could possibly have been compound, making them extremely deadly.\nThe Easterlings are mentioned several times in the books as having\nscores of mounted archers. The horse archers were among the deadliest in\nMiddle Earth, far exceeding the skill of the Rohirrim and Haradrim. The\nEasterlings also had many foot archers weilding both longbows and\nrecurve bows.\n\nOrcs\n\n\n\nOrcs and Goblins were often seen carrying bows, but are also viewed as\npoor handlers of the weapon. Their bows can range from being as tall as\nan Uruk to relatively short. The maximum effective ranges included 50\nand 100 yards. Orc arrows were usually tipped with poison or barbed, so\neven a glancing hit could be fatal.\n\nHobbits\n\nThe Hobbits were not a warring people, but their best unit in times of\nwar are their archers. During the reign of the last King of Arnor before\nits dispansion the first time, hobbits sent archers to his aid as was\nagreed when they moved to live in Arnor. Hobbit archers were also\nresponsible for the death of Grima Wormtongue.﻿\n\n\nMost notable archers\n\n-   Beleg\n-   Legolas\n-   Bard \n"

This stone hill was the foundation for the\ncity Gondolin built by Turgon. Tumladen and the city it contained\nremained secret and safe for 503 years since the Return of the Ñoldor to\nMiddle-earth. It was, however, betrayed by the father of Túrin Turambar,\nHúrin Thalion, when Húrin shouted at the mountains encircling the city\nto let Turgon know to open the gates and let him in (this was an\nill-fated attempt, for no one heard him, and Húrin despaired). As Húrin\nwas under the spell of Morgoth, the Dark Lord finally learned of\nGondolin's location through Húrin. In this way, Húrin doomed the city.\nMorgoth waited for a couple more years before he finally invaded the\ncity, with the help of the traitor Maeglin, who showed him where the\nvale could be found exactly and how it could be attacked (since Great\nEagles guarded its borders). Through his treachery, Maeglin help to lie\nwaste the fair vale of Tumladen and the city that sat on Amon Gwareth in\nthe center of the vale, Gondolin.\n\n\nDescription\n\nTumladen was described by J.R.R. Tolkien as a “...green jewel among the\nencircling hills...” and as a “...green plain among the mountains.” He\nalso describes it as being very fair with the black and smooth Amon\nGwareth in the center of the vale.\n\n\nHistory\n\nTumladen was a great lake in the ancient days of Beleriand. It was\nlocated east of the upper waters of Sirion, as was found out later by\nthe Elves, in the middle of the Encircling Mountains. Turgon was shown\nby Ulmo, a Vala, where it was located by means of a dark tunnel that ran\ndeep under the mountains, hollowed out by streams that ran to join the\nSirion. In this way, Turgon discovered the vale of Tumladen, and thought\nit indeed to be a perfect place to construct his city that was supposed\nto be modeled after the great city of Tirion upon the green hill Tuna,\nback in Valinor. Indeed, after many years of labor, Gondolin did come to\nrival Tirion with its beauty and splendor. As mentioned above, Tumladen\nand the city it held, Gondolin, survived for more than 503 years, the\nlongest lasting of the Ñoldorin kingdoms. The vale was betrayed, as\nmentioned above, by Maeglin and in so doing, Maeglin finally destroyed\nthe last kingdom of the Ñoldor in Beleriand. It was there that the\nbattle of Ecthelion of the Fountain and Gothmog, the Lord of Balrogs,\ntook place in the very square of the King. There it was also that they\nslew each other, and in so doing, Ecthelion had felled the mightiest of\nBalrogs, even though he himself had died also. And so, with the\ntreachery of Maeglin, the fair vale of Tumladen and the city upon Amon\nGwareth, Gondolin, the last kingdom of the Ñoldor, were destroyed and\nruined.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Tumladen_ is a name coming from two Sindarin roots. One of the roots is\n_tum_ (pronounced _toom_), which means a valley. The other Sindarin root\nis _lad_, which means a plain or a valley. Both parts of this name\ndoubly imply and tell that Tumladen is a plain/valley, a very\ninteresting combination of Sindarin roots on the part of Tolkien.\n\n\nOther\n\nIn the Third Age, Tumladen was a valley near the southeastern end of the\nWhite Mountains. When Pippin arrived in Minas Tirith, he saw vehicles\ncarrying the old, the children and the women to take refuge in Lebennin\nthrough the vales Tumladen, Lossarnach, and the mountain-villages.\nTumladen was placed at the source of River Sirith in _The Atlas of\nMiddle-earth_."

The sceptre of the Kings was lost with Ar-Pharazôn in\nthe destruction of Númenor in 3319 of the Second Age. But Elendil,\nthe last Lord of Andúnië, took his sceptre with him when he escaped from\nNúmenor and came to Middle-earth and founded the Kingdoms of Gondor and\nArnor. While the Kings of Gondor wore a crown, the Kings of Arnor bore\nthe sceptre. It became known as the Sceptre of Annúminas, the original\ncapital of the North-kingdom. After the North-kingdom was divided in 861\nthe sceptre passed to the Kings of Arthedain, and then, after Arthedain\nceased to exist in 1974, to the Chieftains of the Dúnedain. Since the\nDúnedain were a wandering people, the sceptre and other heirlooms were\nkept at Rivendell, home of Elrond.\n\nBy the end of the Third Age, the Sceptre of Annúminas was over 5,000\nyears old and was the oldest artifact of Men in Middle-earth, barring\nthe Ring of Barahir which was gifted to Barahir by the Elven king Finrod\nFelagund in the First Age as a symbol of the eternal friendship between\nmen and elves. On Midsummer's Eve of 3019, Elrond brought the Sceptre of\nAnnúminas to Minas Tirith and gave it to Aragorn, King Elessar, of the\nReunited Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe _SCEPTRE OF ANNÚMINAS_ was so named because the Kings of Arnor\ninitially ruled from the city of Annúminas.

    "title": "Gift of Men",
    "page_id": "7687",
    "text": "The GIFT OF MEN refers to a gift of Ilúvatar to his Younger Children,\nwhich remains a source of some confusion for Tolkien enthusiasts. The\nconcept includes both mortality, leading to death of old age, and free\nwill. Below are two interpretations of the nature and extent of the Gift\nof Men as articulated by Tolkien.\n\n\nA spiritual/theological view of the Gift of Men\n\nThe _Gift of Men_ was an act of the Supreme Being Ilúvatar that set the\nrace of Men apart from the Elves. While the race of Elves would know the\nmost bliss and contentment and would conceive more beauty than any\nothers of the Children of Ilúvatar, it was decreed by this gift that Men\nwould be the prime instruments of Ilúvatar within Arda.\n\nIlúvatar willed that the spirits/hearts of Men are not content within\nArda, and find no rest therein, and therefore seek beyond the world and\nits confines. They are not bound to the Circles of the World, as the\nElves and all other creatures of Arda are bound to the Earth. The\nspirits of Men truly leave the physical world, and do not return. Thus\ntheir fates are completely sundered from that of the Elves, who do not\ndie until the world dies, unless slain by violence or ill chance, or by\nwearying at the last of the passage of centuries. But as the years grow\nlong and Time wears, even the Valar will come to envy the gift of\nIlúvatar to the race of Men, that of liberation from the physical world,\nand the inevitability of loss and sorrows that must come with this\nexistence within Arda.\n\nMoreover, it is also a consequence of this true spiritual freedom of not\nbeing bound to either the ordinance of Fate, or the confines of the\nWorld that the spirits of Men do not dwell long in Arda, and after what\nseems to be a very short time to the immortal Elves, men age, grow\nweary, and die.\n\nHowever, a key aspect of this gift of living within Arda for a short\ntime was a virtue instilled into the race of Men to be motivated to\ncreate destinies for themselves amidst the powers and chances of the\nworld. Men were able to shape their lives _beyond_ the Music of the\nAinur, which rules the fates of all other things in Arda. Men may choose\nto live in tune with the themes of the Music that created Arda, or be\nindifferent to it, or live in defiance of it.\n\nIlúvatar understood that Men would not always use this gift of freedom\nin harmony with the world, and would stray often. But he knew that in\ntheir time, men would continue to order their lives within Arda and by\ntheir _“operation everything should be, in form and deed, completed, and\nthe world fulfilled unto the last and the smallest”_ (_The\nSilmarillion_). Thus Men would become the implements by which Ilúvatar's\nplans for Arda will be realized in the ages to come.\n\nThe Gift, as originally bequeathed, was not something that Men feared.\nThough they loved their lives within Arda, they relinquished their\nspirits gracefully, almost gladly, and seemed to pass into a peaceful\nsleep, never to wake again in this life. But their souls go to a place\nunknown to the wisest of Elves or even the Valar.\n\nHowever it is written that when the Second Music of the Ainur is played,\nafter the Dagor Dagorath, the spirits of Men shall be included in this\neven greater theme, when all of the players will know and understand\ntheir part and its relation to the whole, and be tributary to its beauty\nand glory.\n\n\nAvoidance of the Gift of Men\n\nThe shadow of the first Dark Lord brought with it a perversion of the\noriginal intent of the Gift of Ilúvatar, and brought fear out of hope,\nand tainted the Gift. Men began to fear and despise the gift, and began\nto view it not as liberation, but as damnation. It brought about in the\nrace of Men a kind of self-loathing and a denial of the basic nature of\ntheir being as the children of the All-Father Eru Ilúvatar. Instead they\nviewed themselves as flawed in some way and sought to resist this very\nintrinsic nature of their creation. The result of such actions brought\nabout much anguish on the race of Men through the centuries of the\nhistory of Arda.\n\nAt least four characters in _The Lord of the Rings_ are examples of the\ndangers of either deliberately or unintentionally trying to avoid the\nGift of Men. Three of them are transformed into “monsters” by being\ndenied the Gift of Men by sins that they have committed: the Lord of the\nNazgûl (and all of the Nazgûl), the King of the Dead, and Sméagol.\n(Since Sméagol is a Hobbit-like creature, he is numbered among the\nYounger Children of Ilúvatar, and as such is entitled to the strange\nGift of Men.) The Nazgûl are made immortal, but also doomed, by the Nine\nRings. The King of the Dead is transformed into a ghost or monster by\nthe curse of Isildur, because he and his subjects break an oath to fight\nagainst Sauron. Long after his natural death, he fulfils his oath, and\nis released from his condition by Aragorn. (This presumably also applies\nto the other Dead.) Sméagol is consumed by the Ring; over the years, its\ninfluence transforms him from a Hobbit into the freakish Gollum.\n\nBilbo Baggins, like Sméagol, is a Hobbit rather than a Man, but Hobbits\nare also among the Younger Children of Ilúvatar, and are therefore\nrecipients of the Gift of Men. Bilbo encounters Gollum in his cave and\nescapes with the Ring. Being a Hobbit of much better character than\nSméagol, Bilbo better resists the negative effects of possessing the One\nRing. He does not appear to age considerably, but has a sense of\nbecoming “thin and stretched.” Toward the end of his possession of the\nRing, Bilbo begins to show some of the obsessive tendencies of Gollum —\ncalling the Ring “my precious,” and showing flashes of dark hostility\nwhen asked by Gandalf to give the Ring to his heir, Frodo. After the\nRings destruction, Bilbo's appearance begins to show signs of age and\nweariness.\n\nThose Men with the greatest understanding treated death as the Gift it\nwas originally intended to be, and when their time came gladly gave\nthemselves up to it. We see this, for example, in the earlier Kings of\nNúmenor, and Aragorn also accepted the Gift at the natural end of his\nlife. For most Men, though, the Gift was tainted by Morgoth, and they\ncame to fear it rather than embrace it. This fear reached its peak in\nthe later years of Númenor, where even the long life given to the\nNúmenóreans was not enough, and wise men did all they could to try to\nescape death altogether. In the end, this desperation led to Númenor's\ndestruction when Ar-Pharazôn led a battle fleet to the Undying Lands,\nhaving been convinced by Sauron's lies that they held the key to the\nimmortality of the Elves. This deception and treachery eventually saw\nthe lifespans of Men return to more normal times. Even after millennia,\nthe descendants of Numenor still possessed some extended lifespans\nbeyond typical Men; these men became known as the Dúnedain. de:Gabe der\nMenschen it:Fato degli Uomini"

It is similar to (and often\nmistakenly referred to as) the Phalanx formation.\n\n\nUse of the “wall”\n\nThe shield-wall was commonly employed by the forces of Gondor especially\nduring the Third Age. The troops that were most known for their\nemployment of this technique were the Guard of the Fountain Court. These\nelite troops of Gondor would form a near-impenetrable wall of shields\nupon which their foes would break. There was one thing that could break\nthe shield wall, however. It is said that the great Mûmakil (Oliphaunts)\ncould break through any formation that stood against them.\n\nThis method of using the “wall” is used in The Lord of the Rings: The\nBattle for Middle-earth by the Gondor soldiers to massively boost\ndefence, but decrease speed by 50 %"

A few patches of forest provided cover for Felagund's rangers,\nincluding at the feet of Amon Ethir, the Hill of Spies.

Around the gate was set up a\nvast forest of tents and campsites; people, soldiers, and nobles from\nall corners of Middle-earth were present at the ceremony. The coronation\nceremony began with the ringing of a single trumpet, followed by a\nhushed silence from everyone in the crowd. Faramir, as the Steward of\nthe Realm, met Aragorn in front of the gate and declared the Return of\nthe King. The crown, usually placed on the head of the new king by his\nfather ere he died, was as those of the citadel guard, except loftier,\npure white, with wings of pearl and silver in the likeness of a seabird.\nOn it were set seven gems of adamant, and at the crown of the helm was\nset a single jewel, “the light of which went up like a flame”. Holding\nthe crown aloft, Aragorn declared, “Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth\nI am come. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of\nthe world.” These were the first words uttered by Elendil upon his\narrival from the sea. Aragorn, being unable to continue the crowning\ntradition, decided to have the ring-bearer carry the crown, and\nMithrandir place it upon his head. Faramir cried, “Behold the King!”,\nand Aragorn entered his city to the ringing of trumpets and the\nunfurling of the banner of the Tree and Stars from the topmost tower.\n\nit:Incoronazione di Re Elessar"

Later, a high orc-chieftain clothed in black mail with a spear\nand a scimitar rushed into the Chamber. He was slain by Andúril when he\nswept out the scimitar after his spear was broken and hacked by Sam. At\nthe flight of the Fellowship, Frodo saw that nearly hundreds of orcs\nbrandished scimitars and spears in the firelight in the First Hall near\nthe Bridge of Khazad-dum.\n\nThe goblin-soldiers of Isengard did use short broad-bladed swords\ninstead of curved scimitars which was unusual for Orcs. Aragorn\ndistinguished four of them from the slain, and he knew Orcs from the\nNorth normally wielded scimitars.\n\nThe Orcs of Mordor have made straight blades too, and their blade are\nlonger than Isengarders. Grishnákh carried a black knife with a long\njagged blade. Shagrat had a long red knife, and he drove this knife into\nGorbag's throat.\n\n\nHaradrim\n\nThe Haradrim are the civilization most commonly described as using\nscimitars, with their cavalry bringing scimitars onto the Pelennor. In\nthe books, their scimitars were “like a glitter of stars”, but in the\nmovies the only metal they have are gold plates worn as trophies.\nThrough a movie standpoint, the Haradrim would have likely made these\nscimitars by combining a stone, bone, or obsidian blade with a wood,\nstone, or bone handle. These scimitars can typically be 3 foot 6 inch in\nlength, with the blade being blunt for the first 10 inches to avoid\nself-laceration (exposing 4 inches of blunt blade and 30 inches of sharp\nblade)\n\n\nEtymology\n\nTolkien uses the term “scimitar” to describe any curved blade existing\nin Middle-earth. However, there are other kinds of curved blades,\nincluding forwards-curving ones like the Kopis and the Falcutta. Some\nbackwards-curving blades do not count as scimitars in swordsmanship, but\nin the case of Middle-earth as Tolkien describes it, _any_ curved blade\nis a scimitar. The scimitar in the picture is actually a falchion; a\nscimitar is a backwards-curving blade on a J-shaped handle with a\ncross-guard that curved up on the sharp side and down on the dull side.\nThe blade curve was asymmetrical to the handle curve."

It was\nexclusively applied to the House of Finwë.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe title came in being at about the time that the elves undertook their\nGreat Journey to Aman with Finwë being its first. The title continued in\nMiddle-earth after the Ñoldor returned in pursuit of Morgoth. Fëanor or\nthe eldest of his sons could have claimed the title but with his death\nMaedhros waived his claim to the title and ceded it to House of\nFingolfin, out of respect and friendship with them. There were four\nlegitimate High Kings in Middle-earth beginning with Fingolfin and\nending with Gil-galad at the end of Second Age, lasting over\nfour-thousand years. Turgon's relatives Eärendil and then Elrond could\nhave made a claim to the title but never did. It is possible that the\nHigh Kingship passed exclusively through the male line; if this is the\ncase, then the title became effectively extinct with the death of\nGil-galad in Middle-earth. Eärendil and his descendants belonged to the\nhuman House of Hador.\n\n\nSuccession\n\nThe succession of the kingship was never planned, likely because Elves\ncould not die and there would be no need for succession.

Such was the case with Fëanor, who immediately claimed the\ntitle after Finwe's death at the hands of Morgoth.

This\nmove was recognised by all, and the Kingship belonged solely to the\nHouse of Fingolfin. Fingon was the elder son who succeeded his father.\nStrangely however, after Fingon's demise he was not succeeded by his son\nGil-galad, but by Turgon his brother. Once again this would suggest\nloyalty and respect in such a decision, as Turgon was older and more\nexperienced at the time.

After\nhis decline and fall, his successor Sauron continued his works of evil\nuntil he too was defeated.\n\nDarkness and Men\n\nOf all the races in Arda, Men were the easiest to corrupt and drive into\ntemptation and thus were most afflicted by the Darkness. Not long after\nthey awoke, Morgoth, probably appearing as a black rider on a black\nsteed convinced them to worship him as their god instead of Eru, but\nsome escaped and repented, becoming the Edain, the ancestors of the\nDúnedain, but most still remained in darkness. Those that did remain and\nnever went West remained loyal to Morgoth became known as Easterlings\nand were ever allied with the dark powers throughout the long ages\neither for hope of conquest or plunder.\n\nIn the Second Age when the men of Númenor fell under the shadow, their\nfaith wavered and their hearts turned ever to Darkness. Then Sauron came\nand was soon the master of the King's council and men fell ever further\ninto the Shadow, convincing many of the faithless to worship Morgoth in\nthe everlasting Darkness beyond. Here the chief hurt was that men grew\nafraid of death, a fear that lingered on all men. The embassy from\nValinor speculated that this was the first sign of the shadow in\nNumenor. Afterwards, Darkness continued to compel men to follow its\nbanner serving both themselves and Sauron even after his defeat in the\nWar of the Ring.\n\nIt is possible that this is the “shadow” Gandalf is referring to when he\ncommands Durin’s Bane to “Go back to the shadow!”.\n\nLegacy of Darkness\n\nMarring its original design, the advent of Darkness has brought the\nworld its greatest woe but has brought many together who opposed it. As\nmen whose souls are forever corrupted with the seeds of Darkness brought\ndown upon them by Morgoth and Sauron inherit the world after the Fourth\nAge, they may still have to face it again and again until the end of the\nworld when all Darkness is prophesized to be defeated."

Yet their\neyes were still the eyes of our own people,” yet little else is known of\ntheir appearance. Like the males they looked after the growing things of\nMiddle-earth, but Entwives preferred smaller plant life such as: small\ntrees, grasses, fruit trees, flowers, and vegetables, while males tended\nthe larger trees.\n\n\nHistory\n\nLike all Ents they tended their lands in the vast primordial forests of\nMiddle-earth throughout the Elder Days, but sometime in the distant\npast, possibly starting in the Second Age, they became estranged from\ntheir husbands. They moved further East crossing the Great River Anduin\nand began living in what became the Brown Lands, tending lush gardens;\nHowever with the rise of Sauron throughout the Second Age these lands\nwere destroyed. After that they disappeared and everything about them\nwas the subject of rumor and conjecture, being remembered only in the\nsongs of Men and Elves.

Orcs were possibly immortal. Men, Dwarves, Hobbits and most\nother races cannot live forever and thus are subject to aging and\nnatural death however various members of those races have endured longer\nextended lifespans beyond normal constraints through various means. In\nTolkien's universe, despite many having a desire for it, immortality is\nnot desirable for those who are of mortal kind. Every race has a set\nspan; to exceed this span proves to be agony for mortals. There are many\nexamples of this throughout his work: the kings of Numenor who became\nwitless and agonized by attempting to cling to life as long as possible\n(as opposed to earlier kings who gave up their lives willingly);\nGollum's transformation into a twisted and starved thing after having\nhis life extended nearly 5 times longer than it should have been via the\nOne Ring; Bilbo's comment on his 111th birthday about feeling “thin and\nstretched”, like “butter being spread on too much bread”, this also\nbeing an effect of the One Ring. The only time mortals have ever been\naccorded peace in immortality is when they are accounted of the Elves:\nthis choice has been mostly restricted to the Peredhil, the Half-Elven\n(the one known exception to this being Tuor, who was born a full-blooded\nMan but was given the choice to be accounted among the Eldar).\n\nThe Army of the Dead was cursed by Isildur with immortality in form of\nan existence as undead skeletons after they abandoned their oath in the\nWar of the Last Alliance. Their only chance of dying was to fulfill\ntheir oath.\n\nIn the latter half of the Second Age, Sauron's corruption of the\nNumenorean King Ar-Pharazôn made him believe that if he could invade and\nconquer the Blessed Land, he could become immortal, resulting in the\ndestruction of Numenor and Ar-Pharazôn's imprisonment.\n\nit:Immortalità"

    "title": "Realms in Exile",
    "page_id": "9887",
    "text": "'REALMS IN EXILE' was the collective name for the kingdoms, Arnor and\nGondor, established by the Dunedain in Middle-earth after they escaped\nthe Downfall of Númenor. For much of the Third Age, they were the\ndominant powers in the north-west of Middle-earth, and had an enduring\npolitical, economic and cultural significance. Initially politically\nunited, they soon became separate kingdoms, but retained much of their\ncommon culture, and later entered into an alliance. Arnor broke apart\ninto petty kingdoms, the last of which fell in TA 1974. Gondor survived\nand, though becoming ever weaker, it remained the most powerful state\namong the so-called “Free Peoples”. After the War of the Ring, Gondor\nand the former territories of Arnor were merged into the Reunited\nKingdom.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBoth Arnor and Gondor were feudal absolute monarchies. Their first High\nKing was Elendil the Tall, the leader of the fugitives who escaped\nduring the Akallabêth and a member of the old Númenórean nobility. He\nruled Arnor directly, while Gondor was ruled jointly by his sons,\nIsildur and Anárion, who acted as his vassals. As a result of the War of\nthe Last Alliance (see below), the two kingdoms were politically\nseparated; Arnor was ruled by Isildur's descendants, and Gondor by those\nof Anárion. In a departure from Númenórean practice, equal primogeniture\nwas abolished in favour of an exclusively male succession, perhaps\nbecause of the role the King had in both realms as supreme army\ncommander and the frequent wars in which the realms were embroiled.\n\nWhile Arnor and Gondor are called “the realms of the Dúnedain”, in fact\nthe Dúnedain made up only a small part of their population. The bulk of\nthe human population in the north-west of Middle-earth consisted of\nnative Men and descendants of earlier Númenórean colonists, the two\ngroups having intermingled to varying degrees. The Dúnedain who arrived\nwith Elendil and his sons, being of pure Númenórean blood and culture,\nwere more gifted and powerful than the local inhabitants. Furthermore,\nthe House of Elendil commanded particular respect and loyalty on account\nof his descent from Elros and his ancestors' leadership of the Faithful\nin Númenor itself. The Dúnedain therefore quickly established themselves\nas a sort of hereditary aristocracy, and provided many of the realms'\nleading statesmen, administrators and military commanders. However,\nlocal tribes and lordships, many held by families not of Númenórean\ndescent, persisted, especially away from the great cities. Unlike the\nearlier colonists, the Dúnedain came to discourage intermarriage with\nthose they termed “lesser Men,” fearing perhaps that their gifts would\nbe bred out; this policy eventually had disastrous consequences for\nGondor.\n\nAmong themselves, the Dúnedain spoke a dialect of Sindarin, in token of\ntheir ancient friendship with the Elves, and to set themselves apart\nfrom the hostile “Black Númenóreans” who had established lordships in\nthe more southerly regions of Middle-earth. But in dealings with their\nsubject peoples and the surrounding nations, they used Westron, a\ndescendant of the Adûnaic language of Númenor, closely related to many\nof the Mannish dialects that already prevailed in their territories. In\nthis way, Westron (which also became known as the Common Speech) became\nthe everyday language of most of the inhabitants of the realms,\nincluding later immigrants such as the Shire-folk; and even other nearby\nindependent kingdoms and peoples, who had languages of their own, chose\nWestron for their dealings with foreigners, so that it became the\nlanguage of trade and diplomacy throughout the West. The Westron was\narguably the most enduring cultural legacy of the Realms in Exile.\n\n\nHistory\n\nSecond Age\n\nArnor and Gondor were founded in SA 3320, the year after the Akallabêth.\nHowever, Sauron, who hated Elendil and his family on account of their\nfriendship with the Elves and their opposition to his policies in\nNúmenor, had survived Númenor's downfall, in which he played a leading\npart. He returned to Middle-earth, and discovered that the power of the\nElves under Gil-galad had increased in his absence, and that the Realms\nin Exile, whose territory extended even to the borders of Mordor, were\ninclined to side with the Elves in the event of war. Thus, after a\nmostly peaceful century in which Elendil ruled in the north and Isildur\nand Anárion in the south, Sauron suddenly attacked Gondor (SA 3429),\ncapturing Minas Ithil and destroying its White Tree. Isildur fled to\nArnor, while Anárion defended Osgiliath and Minas Anor. In 3430,\nGil-galad and Elendil formed the Last Alliance, initially consisting of\nthe Realms in Exile and the Elf-kingdoms of Lindon and Imladris. The\nAlliance was soon joined by the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm and the Silvan\nElves of Mirkwood and Lórien. The Allies overthrew Sauron's forces at\nthe Battle of Dagorlad, and besieged Barad-dûr for seven years; Anárion,\nalong with many others, was killed during the siege. At last, seeing no\nother way to break the siege, Sauron himself came forth, and wrestled\nwith Elendil and Gil-galad on the slopes of Mount Doom; they defeated\nhim, but both perished. Isildur cut Sauron's ring of power from his hand\nand took it for his own. Sauron passed away into the shadows and the\nSecond Age ended.\n\nThird Age\n\nWith both Elendil and Anárion dead, the organisation of the Realms in\nExile became murky. Isildur became sole King of both Gondor and Arnor,\nbut instead of seeking to rule both Kingdoms personally, he instructed\nhis nephew Meneldil, the oldest surviving son of Anárion, before making\nhim responsible for ruling Gondor. Isildur, along with his three eldest\nsons (Elendur, Aratan and Ciryon), then journeyed north, Isildur\nintending to take up the high kingship of his father in Arnor. Some two\nthousand years later, Arvedui (Isildur's remote descendant in the north)\nand the Dúnedain of Gondor disagreed as to whether Isildur relinquished\nhis rights in Gondor, or whether he merely made Meneldil responsible for\nruling Gondor under his suzerainty.\n\nWhatever Isildur's plans, they were put to a sudden end when he and his\nthree eldest sons were killed in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields. In\nthat unexpected attack by Orcs, most of Isildur's followers were killed;\nhe himself escaped, taking advantage of the Ring's power of\ninvisibility, but the Orcs tracked him to the Anduin. When he tried to\nswim across the river, the Ring slipped from his finger, and the Orcs\nsaw him and killed him with arrows. Of his entire army and entourage as\nhe journeyed north, only three eventually reached Arnor; among these was\nhis esquire, who had kept the shards of Elendil's famous sword Narsil.\nThat sword then became an heirloom of the Kingdom of Arnor.\n\nThe sceptre of Arnor now came to Valandil, the youngest of Isildur's\nfour sons, who had remained in Rivendell during the war, being still a\nchild when the Last Alliance attacked Sauron; but not until TA 10 did he\nactually assume his responsibilities. By this time, whatever Isildur's\noriginal intentions were, Meneldil in Gondor was a thoroughly\nindependent monarch, and Valandil and his successors in Arnor, badly\nweakened by Arnor's losses in the war, were in no position to exert\nauthority over Gondor, even if they had wished to do so. So it was that,\nin place of the unified entity of Elendil's day, two independent\nkingdoms arose.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that Arnor, despite its notional superiority,\nwas by now the weaker of the two realms. Although its territory\nencompassed almost all of vast Eriador, its population was severely\ndiminished and it never really recovered. In TA 861, Arnor was divided\ninto the three petty kingdoms of Arthedain, Rhudaur and Cardolan, which\nfrequently fought amongst themselves, weakening the northern Dúnedain\nstill further. About TA 1300, an evil power known as the Witch-king\nestablished the kingdom of Angmar in the mountainous wastes north of\nArthedain and Rhudaur, and proceeded to conquer the realms of the\nnorthern Dúnedain one by one. In Rhudaur, power was seized from the\nDúnedain in the 14th century by the native Hillmen, who allied\nthemselves with Angmar before eventually being annexed early in the 15th\ncentury. Cardolan was fatally weakened by a defeat at the hands of the\ncombined forces of Angmar and Rhudaur in TA 1409, and its few surviving\nDúnedain, along with most of its other inhabitants, were eventually\nwiped out in the Great Plague of TA 1636. Arthedain, the most powerful\nof the northern kingdoms and the only one in which the line of Isildur\nwas preserved, survived the longest, eventually falling to an all-out\ninvasion from Angmar in TA 1974. After the collapse of Arthedain, the\nsurviving Dúnedain became a wandering people, and secretly guarded\nEriador's few surviving settled communities, such as the Shire and Bree,\nagainst evil and wild creatures.\n\nIn the south, Gondor grew and flourished for a thousand years, gaining\nterritory to the north-east (southern Rhovanion), the north-west\n(Enedwaith) and the south (Umbar). It seems Gondor never sought to\nexpand further northwest than the Greyflood, and no records survive of\nconflict between Gondor and unified Arnor, or between Gondor and\nCardolan. But nor are there any records of alliance or friendly\ncommunication; Gondor seems rather to have been preoccupied with the\npeoples to its east and south, and with the threat of Mordor, which\nGondor guarded with a series of fortresses. Thus Gondor came to control\na vast territory by the time of Hyarmendacil I, but like Arnor it slowly\ndecayed through a combination of internal weaknesses and external\nthreats. Its Dúnedain population slowly shrank, the southern Dúnedain\ntending to marry late and have few children, so that Gondor gradually\nlost its main source of strength compared to the surrounding nations.\nDuring the second millennium of the Third Age, Gondor was hit by three\ngreat calamities. The first was the Kin-strife, a civil war brought\nabout by the marriage of King Valacar to a foreign woman and the\naccession of their son; during the Kin-strife, the Dúnedain aristocracy\nwas decimated, the great _palantír_ of Osgiliath lost, and Umbar was\nwrested from Gondor by the survivors of the rebel faction. The second,\nthe Great Plague that wreaked havoc in Cardolan (see above), had earlier\nkilled great numbers of the people of Gondor. The third calamity, a\ncentury-long war with the Wainriders, cost Gondor its eastern\nterritories and nearly exterminated the royal family.\n\nIn light of the threats of Angmar and the Wainriders, Gondor and\nArthedain made an alliance in TA 1940, the first such alliance for many\ncenturies, and cemented it by the marriage of Arvedui, heir to the\nthrone of Arthedain, and Fíriel, daughter of Ondoher of Gondor. When\nOndoher and his two sons were killed in battle with the Wainriders four\nyears later, Arvedui claimed the now vacant throne of Gondor, by virtue\nof his descent from Isildur and secondarily in right of his wife. Had\nhis claim been accepted, it seems likely that a Reunited Kingdom would\nhave emerged far earlier, and to the advantage of both North and South.\nBut the Council of Gondor, perhaps offended by his assertion of the\nrights of Isildur's descendants in Gondor, and certainly seeing the\nnorthern prince as a weak candidate, instead offered the crown to\nEärnil, the general responsible for victory over the Wainriders and a\ndistant cousin of Gondor's late King. Despite the obvious snub the\nCouncil thus offered to the northern Dúnedain, Eärnil II maintained\nGondor's alliance with Arthedain, going so far as to send an\nexpeditionary force north to help Arvedui (who had by then succeeded his\nfather) against Angmar; but that fleet arrived too late to save\nArthedain, instead providing the bulk of the forces that would smash\nAngmar at Fornost. In that encounter, Eärnur, Eärnil's son and eventual\nsuccessor, was personally humiliated by the Witch-king. When therefore\nthe Nazgûl had conquered Minas Ithil (TA 2002), and Eärnur succeeded his\nfather, the Witch-king, appealing to his pride, challenged him to single\ncombat; he rode to the gates of Minas Morgul (as Minas Ithil had been\nrenamed) with a small retinue and was never seen or heard from again.\n\nThus, within two generations of the Dúnedain, both Arnor and Gondor lost\ntheir kings. The northern Dúnedain were too weak to maintain a kingdom,\nand so their leaders, the successors of Isildur, took the humble title,\n“Chieftain of the Dúnedain”. In the south, by contrast, Gondor was still\na viable state, but the male-line descendants of Anárion were all but\nextinct. Unlike Rhudaur and Cardolan in the north, the Dúnedain of\nGondor refused to look for a king outside the royal family, so power was\nexercised in the name of the king by 26 successive Ruling Stewards, the\nfirst of whom was Mardil the Steadfast. By the time of the later\nStewards, Sauron's forces were constantly encroaching on Gondor's\nborders, and several more territories were ceded to allies or conquered\nby enemies: Calenardhon in the 26th century, and Ithilien, Gondor's sole\nremaining province east of the Anduin, in the 30th. In the War of the\nRing, Sauron sought to smash Gondor, his strongest opponent, but forces\nfrom Gondor and other nations beat his armies back in the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields. During that battle, Aragorn II, the Chieftain of the\nDúnedain of the North, and thus a descendant of both Isildur and\nAnárion, distinguished himself by arriving with a strong relief army at\nthe critical moment, and was acclaimed by the people of Gondor as King;\nhis only notable opponent within Gondor's ruling classes, Ruling Steward\nDenethor II, was driven mad and committed suicide on the day of the\nbattle. Thus, after Sauron was defeated by the destruction of his Ring,\nAragorn was crowned King of Gondor and received the sceptre of the Kings\nof Arnor, becoming the first King of the Reunited Kingdom."

Much of this story was later\ninfluenced the details of the similar _The Notion Club Papers_ (with at\nleast one of the characters referencing the general events of the _The\nLost Road_).\n\n    I began an abortive book of time-travel of which the end was to be\n    the presence of my hero in the drowning of Atlantis. This was to be\n    called Númenor, the Land in the West. The thread was to be the\n    occurrence time and again in human families (like Durin among the\n    Dwarves) of a father and son called by names that could be\n    interpreted as Bliss-friend and Elf-friend. ..... It started with a\n    father-son affinity between Edwin and Elwin of the present, and was\n    supposed to go back into legendary time by way of an Eädwine and\n    Ælfwine of circa A.D. 918, and Audoin and Alboin of Lombardic\n    legend, and so to the traditions of the North Sea concerning the\n    coming of corn and culture heroes, ancestors of kingly lines, in\n    boats (and their departure in funeral ships). ..... In my tale we\n    were to come at last to Amandil and Elendil leaders of the loyal\n    party in Númenor, when it fell under the domination of Sauron.\n\nThe importance of the story is that it was one of the earliest\nintroductions to the story of the fall of Numenor.\n\nThe book's title is a reference to the Straight Road (which is also\nknown as the Lost Road or the Straight Path)"

Certainly no\nmaps of the Third Age extend that far eastward or westward, so we do not\nknow.

Aman was\nremoved from the circles of the world and the seas bent so that no man\ncould ever find the Undying Lands ever again.

It was close to the Great Goblin's cavern by following an\nestimated thirty miles of long, dark, and narrow tunnel.\n\nThe cave housed a small subterranean lake of ice cold water in which sat\na tiny island which supplied Gollum with a small amount of protection\nfrom the nearby Goblin Camp.

Following the flow of an\nunderground stream, he made his way to a dark cave and made his home\nthere.  He soon found out that Goblins were living close by and used the\nnetwork of tunnels adjoining his. When he felt bold and hungry enough,\nGollum, using his magic ring to become invisible, throttled them and ate\nthem.\n\nIn TA 2941, Bilbo Baggins and his company of Dwarves were journeying\nthrough the Misty Mountains and were taken by surprise as a group of\ngoblins jumped upon them, causing a great mass of confusion amongst the\nDwarves. During their escape from Goblin-town, Bilbo would then have to\nfend for himself after falling and being missed in the darkness. He soon\nstumbled upon this cave after finding the One Ring and subsequently met\nGollum. Gollum, afraid of Bilbo's Elvish dagger, didn't attack as he\nnormally would have done. Instead, he spoke to Bilbo and ended up taking\npart in a game of riddles with the hobbit. If Gollum won, he would kill\nand eat Bilbo, and if Bilbo won, Gollum would show him the way out.\nAfter Gollum lost the riddle-game and discovered the loss of the Ring,\nhe became enraged and tried to kill Bilbo. However, Bilbo put on the\nRing and used it to follow Gollum to the exit of the cave.\n\nAfter Bilbo's escape with the Ring, Gollum remained in the cave for a\nlong time. However, he eventually left and wandered Middle-earth, trying\nto find Bilbo and reclaim his One Ring for himself once again."

It ran between Minas Tirith and the Fords\nof Isen in the Gap of Rohan, where it joined the North-South Road to\nArnor. The Great West Road was approximately 425 miles long.\n\nAt its far eastern end, the Great West Road met the North-way which came\nfrom Minas Tirith through Forannest, the North-gate of the Rammas Echor.\nThe Great West Road then curved around Amon Dîn and ran westward through\nAnorien. The Road skirted the edge of the Drúadan Forest and passed the\nBeacon-hills of Gondor at the foot of the White Mountains.\n\nThe Great West Road ran through the edge of the Firien wood to avoid the\nmarshy land north of the forest. A path marked by a standing stone\nbranched southward off the Road to Halifirien, the last of the\nBeacon-hills. At the western edge of the Firien Wood, the Great West\nRoad crossed a bridge over the Mering Stream, which was the border\nbetween Gondor and Rohan.\n\nIn Rohan, the Great West Road passed through the Fenmarch and the\nregions of the Eastfold and the Folde. The Road traversed the Snowbourn\nby way of a ford near Edoras, and a track branched off to the city.\nFurther on, the Deeping-road branched off into the Deeping Coomb where\nHelm's Deep was located.\n\nThe Great West Road then curved northwestward for a ways. About two\nmiles before the Fords of Isen there was a sharp westward turn and the\nRoad ran straight down to the riverbank. On the other side of the Isen,\nthe North-South Road began. A branch road led north to Isengard.\n\nIn the early days of Gondor, the Great West Road and the North-South\nRoad formed a single Royal Road between the two Kingdoms of the\nDunedain. At that time, the region between the Mering Stream and the\nFords of Isen was a province of Gondor called Calenardhon. In TA 2510,\nthat land became Rohan and the Rohirrim were responsible for maintaining\nthe stretch of the Great West Road that ran through their land.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, an army from Mordor crossed the Anduin into\nAnorien and blocked the Great West Road. They dug trenches and erected\nstakes in the roadway with the purpose of preventing the Rohirrim from\ncoming to Minas Tirith. But Ghan-buri-Ghan led the Rohirrim by a\nforgotten way through the Stonewain Valley and avoided the enemy forces.\nThe Rohirrim arrived at dawn on March 15, TA 3019, and helped win the\nBattle of the Pelennor Fields.\n\nNames and Etymology Also referred to as the '''West Road '''as well as\nthe HORSE-ROAD and the HORSE-MEN'S ROAD.\n\nThe North-South Road and the Great West Road were collectively called\nthe ROYAL ROAD or the GREAT ROAD.

    "text": "COMMON BEVERAGES IN MIDDLE EARTH refers to what people generally prefer\nto drink on a regular basis.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThere are many types of drinks in Middle-earth. Some are preferred by\nMen, some by Hobbits, and still more by Dwarves, Elves, and Orcs. Let us\nstart with Men and Hobbits.\n\nMen, as well as Hobbits, are big Inn and Pub dwellers, and therefore\nlove a good drink. At the famous Prancing Pony Inn, located in Bree, a\nparticularly loved beverage is Barliman's Best, a very good ale served\nin pints, for Men are used to a beverage normally served in that\nquantity. However, Hobbits find it a rare treat to be served a pint, for\ntheir small body weight accounts for their limited serving size.\nTherefore, some travelling Hobbits that venture into Big Folk territory\nlove to order from any drink selection that comes their way. Other types\nof drinks that Men and Hobbits prefer that are not signature labeled\nlike Barliman's Best would include all types of beer and wine, and\nsometimes mead.\n\nAnother well known wine comes from the lake city of Lake-town, located\nsouth of Dale near the Lonely Mountain, east of Mirkwood. This city was\nfull of various merchants, and a prime trade was the selling of\nLake-town's fine wine, which was so good that even the Elves of Mirkwood\nput forth effort in obtaining it for their feasts and celebrations. This\nwine was floated back and forth in barrels between the Lake City and the\nElven kingdom in Mirkwood by use of a river for years.\n\nDwarves are especially fond of their drink, having been based on the\nNorse. To them, a day without a drink is a day not fully completed.\nDwarves prefer mead, but will just as soon accept any type of beer, just\nlike Men and Hobbits. Wine is not usually seen as a common Dwarf\nbeverage, for Dwarves are not depicted ever drinking it. However, based\non their common love for any alcoholic drink, one can assume that\nDwarves would not hesitate to drink a few goblets from this grape\nextract.\n\nElves are lovers of wine. As stated, the Elves of Mirkwood get all of\ntheir wine from the lake city of Lake-town, and there is never a\ndecrease in demand for it. Likewise, all other Elves of Middle-earth are\nnot easily parted from their various types of local wine. Travelers that\ncome upon their feasts will see that after the wine has been passed\naround for a while, a dramatic change in the general merry making\noccurs. When offered other types of alcoholic beverages, such as beer,\nElves are not known to decline, for they seem to accept all forms of\nalcohol. It is even said that an Elf could best a Dwarf in a drinking\ncontest, regardless of the type of drink.\n\nOrcs are only known to drink draught (or grog as it's commonly called),\nbut that's not to say that an orc isn't willing to consume whatever they\npillage. It's unknown what exactly draught is made of, but based on the\ntypical orc diet it can be suspected to have been brewed from flesh or\nblood, along with some sort of alcohol. Whatever it's made from, it's\ncertainly cause for the spectacular explosions that occur whenever\ndraught is ignited. It can also be described as being vile and\nfoul-smelling, but to an orc, anyone who hosts a feast without the drink\nwould be flogged until dead. In practical forms, draught is used as a\nliquid reserve for long trips in the stead of water and as a medicine.\nThe healing potency of draught is reflective of the orcs' ancestry with\nthe elves, able to scab over wounds within hours.\n"

However, the phonology of the two\nlanguages differed much, with Telerin often being more conservative than\nQuenya.\n\nFinarfin is said to have learned Telerin. He also gave his sons\nTelerin-influenced Quenya names.\n\nThe coexistence with the Teleri, made the Noldor to differientate\nthemselves from the speech of the Vanyar. For example the Vanyar\npronounced /f/ very soft, almost like /hw/, but the Noldor resisted this\nchange through influence from the Teleri.\n\nAlso, the Teleri prized silver above gold, and their skill as\nsilversmiths was esteemed even by the Noldor who seemed to prefer the\nTelerin word _telpe_ “silver” intead the Quenya form _tyelpë_."

    "text": "The '''Kine of Araw '''were legendary cattle-like creatures that lived\naround the fertile plains of the Sea of Rhûn from the earliest days of\nArda onward.\n\n\nHistory\n\nAccording to the Encyclopedia of Arda, the Kine of Araw were descended\nfrom the even greater kine (cattle) of Orome the Hunter, who was known\nto be the master of beasts and birds. As Orome was chosen to lead the\nElves on the Great Journey, he might have intentionally (or\naccidentally) left his livestock in the East.\n\nThey presumably lived in the areas immediately adjacent to the Sea of\nHelcar, relocating to their present location around the Sea of Rhun when\nthat great ocean dried up.\n\nVorondil the Steward of Gondor ventured to the Far East and hunted one\nsuch beast, utilizing its great horns to craft the exquisite Horn of\nGondor. For the lengthy years afterward, it became an heirloom of\nGondor's stewards, handing it down to their oldest son for innumerable\ngenerations.\n\nHowever, its doom drew ever nearer, just as Sauron’s shadow returned\nfrom the depths of the East. During the War of the Ring it was carried\nby Boromir, son of Denethor. It was only when Boromir was assailed by\nhundreds of Uruk-hai, that the horn was eventually broken. The Uruk\nscimitars and broadswords clove the great horn in two, rendering it\nuseless. After being presented to his grieving (and insane) father, it\nwas buried with him.\n\n\nDescription\n\nAccording to Appendix A of the Lord of the Rings, the Kine of Araw were\nfar larger and splendid than common, earthly cattle (like Old Bessie).\nTheir hides were a gleaming pallid white that reflected the sun rising\nfrom the Gates of Morning in the East.\n\nThe horns attached to their gargantuan bodies were colossal in size,\ngiving the kine an air of grandeur. While nobody knows what the kine\nreally looked like, their size and scant description that we possess may\ngive them an appearance similar to the real-life Texas Longhorn.\n\nThere are certain parallels between the Kine and the real-world Aurochs.\nThe Aurochs is considered to be the ancestor of modern cattle; they were\nlarge, dangerous animals with great horns living across North Africa,\nEurope, and most of Asia. The Aurochs was driven to extinction in the\n1600s by heavy hunting, especially by royal families across Europe.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n'''Kine '''is a rather archaic English word, meaning “cattle.” As\nTolkien was deeply fluent in Old English, Welsh, and Scottish, he would\nhave used the term rather than a more modern one to better suit the\nmedieval feel of the _Lord of the Rings._\n\nLikewise, '''Araw '''is the Sindarin form of Oromë, which is a term from\nQuenya. The full term denotes and explains the beasts' heritage and\nhistory."

For Angmar, that most evil of realms in Eriador, was located\njust north of the North Downs, and many evil beings who were struggling\nto find a purpose in Angmar after the departure of the Witch-king\nfinally resolved to invade the lands south of them. Thus, the North\nDowns became a frontier against this new evil arisen in Angmar, a\nremnant of the old power of the Witch King called the Shadow of Angmar.\n\nThere was still hope though, in that harsh war zone, for the Free\nPeoples of Eriador waged constant war on the new servants of Angmar and\nthe Witch King. Several towns that had existed in that area for years,\nand that were now besieged by the servants of the Witch King, found\nthemselves suddenly strengthened by a flow of warriors from all across\nEriador."

    "title": "Elven Weapons and Armour",
    "page_id": "12526",
    "text": "Elven Weapons\n\nThroughout their existence, Elves have been masters of making and using\nweapons and arms. Their skill at forging weapons and armor surpasses the\nrace of Men, but not the skill of the race of Dwarves. Tolkien writes:\n“In the tempering of steel alone of all crafts the Dwarves were never\noutmatched even by the Noldor, and in the making of mail  their\nwork had no rival.”\n\nEven more renowned is the Elven skill at using their fine weapons, be it\nbow or blade. The purpose of this article is to explain the type of\nweapons the Elves have used and what effect these weapons have had in\npast wars and battles. The article is not extensive, and covers only the\nmost basic of Elven weapons. \n\nSword\n\nThe Elven sword is used frequently by standard Elven warriors and it\ncomes in different forms. Apart from notable Elven blades such as\nAnglachel (wielded by Beleg Cúthalion and Turin Turambar, as well as\nbeing forged by Eol, the Dark Elf) , Glamdring (wielded by Gandalf), and\nOrcrist (used by Thorin Oakenshield), many more fierce swords have\nserved their handlers well in battle and have no title.\n\nA clue to what the earliest of the Elven blades were made of lies in a\ndescription of the first Orcs who attacked the Laegrim Elves in\nBeleriand. Apparently, these Orcs were equipped with steel weapons which\ngave them the edge over their Elven counterparts. Therefore, Elven\nweapons at that time were not in existence or were made of a weaker\nmaterial than steel. When the use of steel weaponry came upon the Elves\nin Valinor, most notably the Noldor, when Morgoth spoke to them\nconcerning weapons, a great change in the style of weaponmaking came\nabout, likely including the creation of the sword, due especially to\nsuperior Noldorin metallurgy.\n\n\n\nSting, the shortsword used by the Hobbits Bilbo and Frodo, is an example\nof Elven blades at their peak. Being able to glow blue when orcs and\ngoblins are near, Sting shows how Elven blades grew to have properties\nunknown to mortals. Even the black sword Anglachel is said to have\nspoken to Turin before it aided him in his suicide. Thus, Elven blades\nbecame renowned as great weapons, capable of performing deeds beyond the\nskill of their handlers and were even more glorious when the use of\nMithril was allowed to the Elves.\n\nBow\n\nElves mastered both the construction and uses of the bow, developing the\nstandard longbow and creating different variations of it. None were more\nskilled with the longbow than the Silvan Elves and most notable of those\nwere the Galadhrim, the wardens of Lothlórien, the Golden Wood. Some,\nwho became true masters of this weapon, were renown as skilled marksmen\nin several wars, the most famous being Legolas Greenleaf and Beleg\nCúthalion.\n\nElven arrows are not elaborately recorded and so the reader does not\nhave a wide variety of knowledge on the subject, though certain arrows\nwere dear to their owners, such as Dailir was to Beleg.\n\n\nElven Armour and Shields\n\nThe armour of the Elves has evolved throughout their days in Arda, but\nhas always been well made and of the highest quality, the only rival to\nit being Dwarf-made armor which is the finest to ever grace\nMiddle-Earth. Again, not much is said regarding Elven armor only that it\nis bright and beautiful to look upon. Much of Elven armour is derived\nfrom the early Dwarf designs, for the two races have great influence\nupon one another.\n\nThe earliest Elven armour was made by the Dwarves, and appears to have\nbeen scale armor, eventually superseded by mail of rings. Scale and\nchainmail were the armors used throughout the First Age, and appear to\nhave never been replaced. Thus, the armies of the Last Alliance likely\nwore the same mail worn by their ancestors millennia prior. Gil-galad\nhimself is said to have worn mail made of silver. Lastly, regarding\nSilvan Elves, the armor in which these forest dwellers were clad in\nconsisted mostly of leather and offered minimal protection,\n\nShields were also used by the Elves and highly decorated in Elf-fashion,\nlike their armour. The shields used by Elves appear to have been of much\nhigher-quality than the shields of Men--Tuor found himself a long kite\nshield, made of wood but plated with steel. Elves of high rank used\nshields decked with crystal."

    "page_id": "12543",
    "text": "History\n\nThroughout their existence, the so-called Naugrim, or Dwarves, have been\nexperts at making and using various weaponry, with no equal. This skill\ncomes from the Vala Aulë the Smith, who crafted the Dwarves at the\nbeginning of Arda. The list of common Dwarven weaponry goes on and on,\nand from their very origin each type, including bows, swords, axes, and\nmattocks, have retained a unique Dwarven identity and respect among\nother cultures.\n\n\nWeaponry\n\nAxe\n\n The Dwarven axe is the most famous and likely the most common weapon\nfor any Dwarf soldier. Used extensively throughout the wars fought by\nDwarves, the axe probably came into use by the time Khazad-dûm was\nfounded, somewhere in the Ages of Stars. The idea of the use of the axe\nis to drive forward while attacking; therefore, it is not good in\ndefense. Being a weapon that is hard to control, the axe takes great\nskill to master, which shows the skill and temperament the Dwarves have\nin warfare.\n\nSword\n\nThe Dwarven sword is less commonly wielded than the axe. Yet, certain\nfamous Dwarven figures have wielded this weapon to great effect. The\nwarriors of the Iron Hills carried a broad shortsword as a sidearm.\n\nMattock\n\nThe war-pick was the favored weapon of the Dwarves of the Iron Hills.\nTheir skill with them appears to have been well-known, for in most\ninstances where they are mentioned, their mattocks are named as well.\n\nBow\n\nThough not commonly associated with the Khazad, it appears bows were\nutilized by them as well. Thorin and company used bows given to them by\nBeorn in Mirkwood, and Thorin was the only dwarf of the company to hit\nthe stag they saw, implying skill with a bow. Thorin also scavenged a\nbow from the armories of Erebor, and used it to shoot at emissaries sent\nto negotiate with him.\n\n\nArmor\n\nPerhaps the Dwarves are best known for their armour above all other\nthings battle-related. Dwarf armor would be iron or steel chain-mail,\nwhich was invented and used by the Dwarves to great effect by the time\nof the Wars of Beleriand. Of course, iron or steel helms and shields\nwould accompany this chain-mail. Dwarven helmets are recorded to have\ncovered the face, with the use of a forged mask. This mask was\nparticularly helpful when fighting Dragons, as the face would be\nshielded from the flames, thanks to the expert craft of the Dwarves.\nLastly, with the use of Mithril, their armor changed more dramatically\nthan any other of their works did. Having such properties as to make\narrows bounce off, Mithril became an invaluable substance to the\nDwarves, so much, so that a single mail shirt could be “worth more than\nthe value of the Shire and everything in it”. However, the use of\nMithril in arms and armor became very limited after Orcs of the Misty\nMountains and the newly awakened Balrog of Morgoth overran the Dwarf\nmines of Khazad-dûm.\n\nDwarven shields are little-known, but the warriors of the Iron Hills\nwore a circular shield on their backs."

    "page_id": "12556",
    "text": "The NORTH-SOUTH ROAD was part of the Royal Road linking Arnor and\nGondor. The North-South Road was approximately 600 miles long. It ran\nbetween Fornost in the north and Isengard in the south. At the Fords of\nIsen, the North-South Road merged with the Great West Road.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe northern half of the North-South Road was in Eriador. From Fornost,\nthe Road ran south to Bree. Outside the West-gate of Bree, the\nNorth-South Road intersected with the Great East Road. At this major\ncrossroads was the inn called The Prancing Pony, where travellers\nbrought news from the South as well as goods such as Pipe-weed, which\nfirst came to Bree and the Shire via the North-South Road.\n\nThe North-South Road then moved on through the narrow passage called the\nAndrath between the Barrow-downs and the South Downs. South of the\nAndrath, a road to the Shire branched off the North-South Road. The\nNorth-South Road then curved southeastward through the region of\nMinhiriath.\n\nAt the city of Tharbad, the Road crossed the River Greyflood on the\nsouthern border of Eriador. Originally, the Road went over the Bridge of\nTharbad. On either side of the Bridge, the Road was built up on\ncauseways to traverse the surrounding marshland. However, the Bridge was\ndestroyed by floods in TA 2912 and all that remained was a dangerous\nford.\n\nThe southern half of the North-South Road passed through Enedwaith,\nwhich at one time nominally belonged to Gondor but was essentially a\nborderland between Gondor and Arnor. East of the Road in Enedwaith was\nDunland at the foot of the Misty Mountains.\n\nAt the southern end of the Misty Mountains, the North-South Road curved\neastward through the Gap of Rohan and ended at the Fords of Isen. Just\nwest of the Fords a road branched north to Isengard. East of the Fords\nwas the Great West Road to Minas Tirith and Osgiliath.\n\nTogether the North-South Road and the Great West Road formed the Royal\nRoad, or Great Road, which was the main route by land between Gondor and\nArnor. The two Kingdoms were founded in 3320 of the Second Age. Each was\nresponsible for maintaining their own stretch of the Road, and together\nthey built and maintained the Bridge of Tharbad and its causeways.\n\nAfter the Great Plague of TA 1636, Gondor and Arnor were considerably\nweakened and could no longer keep the Road and Bridge in repair. The\nNorth-kingdom fell in TA 1974 and Fornost at the northern end of the\nNorth-South Road was abandoned. The causeways near Tharbad eventually\ndisintegrated and the marshes encroached on the Road. In the spring of\nTA 2912 after the Fell Winter, floods caused the Bridge to collapse.\n\nFewer and fewer travellers used the North-South Road and it became\novergrown with grass, so that the people of Bree called it the Greenway.\nHowever, during the War of the Ring at the end of the Third Age,\nunwelcome travellers began to come up the North-South Road from the\nSouth. Some were honest refugees, but many were troublemakers, including\nagents of Saruman. Early in 3019, there was fighting in Bree, and the\nShire was taken over by Saruman's agents.\n\nThe Hobbits expelled the Men from the Shire in the Battle of Bywater on\nNovember 3, and the Rangers of the North returned from the war and dealt\nwith the other troublemakers. The North-kingdom was reestablished by\nAragorn, King Elessar, and the North-South Road was open to travellers\nonce more.\n\n\nNames & Etymology\n\nThe NORTH-SOUTH ROAD was called the GREENWAY in later years by the\nBree-folk because it had become disused and overgrown with grass. It was\nsometimes called the NORTH ROAD and the OLD SOUTH ROAD.\n\nThe North-South Road and the Great West Road were collectively called\nthe ROYAL ROAD or the GREAT ROAD.

Boldog drove his host south over the highlands of\nDorthonion and the through enchanted forest of Taur-nu-Fuin following\nthe Orcs' Road of Haste into the Pass of Anach. Where fell darkness met\nthe mists of the magic, which were the Girdle of Melian, just east of\nthe river Mindeb, the Orc-host reached the border of Doriath. To meet\nthe deadly threat posed by Boldog's invasion in force, Thingol musters\nhis full might with his two great Captains, Beleg and Mablung. He leads\nthe army of Sindarin Elves beyond the North March of Doriath. Thingol\nand Boldog meet in single combat in the midst of the battle. Thingol\nwielded his Dwarf-forged sword, Aranrúth, Boldog fought with an iron\nspear of some note that was later used by Mablung in the Hunting of the\nWolf. Thingol slays Boldog, the Orc-host is utterly defeated and the\nremnants destroyed by being driven into Taur-nu-Fuin.\n\n\n\nThe Battle of the Northmarch was the culminating battle of a series of\nattacks in Morgoth's campaign against Doriath, following his victories\nin the Dagor Bragollach (Battle of Sudden Flame), the fourth of the\ngreat Battles of Beleriand that broke the Siege of Angband.\n\nCanon\n\nDetails of Boldog's raid are scattered through numerous versions of\ntexts within ''The Lays of Beleriand, ''compiled by Christopher Tolkien\n- however, no aspect of the plot-lines involving Boldog are in serious\ncontradiction with the “final” canon of _Quenta Silmarillion._ Boldog's\nindependent command of a host of orcs with its formidable objectives\nindicates that he would have been several ranks above most other\nOrc-Captains and champions (such as Orcobal or Balcmeg, who both were\nfrom a different century), and it is thought elsewhere in the sources\nthat Boldog was of some lesser order of the Maiar corrupted by Morgoth\nthat took the form of an Orc, as opposed to previously being an Elf that\nbecame mutilated (which was the ancient origin of Orcs in general)."

Men were\nbeginning to increase in the lands near them and with Sauron occupying\nDol Guldur, the long and peaceful forest of Greenwood the Great was\nbecoming evil. Beginning in TA 1050, the migration began but not all at\nonce as only the Harfoot tribe was willing to made the journey over the\nMisty Mountains. The Fallohides and the Stoors joined them in TA 1150.\n\nThe Hobbit tribes settled in many different places in Eriador. The\nHarfoots went over the mountains making it as far as Weathertop and were\nlater intermingled with the Fallohides settling there in the Weather\nHills for a time. The Stoors, who climbed the Redhorn Pass through the\nmountains, settled in the Angle and Dunland, living there for many\ncenturies. In the Angle, they were intermingled with both the Fallohides\nand the Harfoots in a series of settlements known as the Forgotten\nVillages.\n\nWith the threat from Angmar worsening, the Stoors in the north moved\nsouth to Dunland with their kin, some even returned to the Vales of\nAnduin, settling in the Gladden Fields, and were probably the ancestors\nof Déagol and Sméagol. By TA 1300 mixed groups of Hobbits began settling\nin Bree-land, especially in the village of Staddle where they lived\npeacefully side by side with the Men of Bree. Breeland was their home\nfor over three-hundred years until TA 1601, when King Argeleb II of\nArthedain granted them the land between the Far Downs and the Brandywine\nRiver. Large mixed groups of Hobbits migrated there during that year and\nlater, in TA 1630, the remainder of the Stoors of Dunland moved there as\nwell. Some Hobbits chose to remain in Bree, where they lived ever\nafter.\n\n\nNotes\n\nThese events are considered ancient history and are recorded in the\nfirst known written records that mention Hobbits.

This design made it\neasy for the Lakemen to catch trade goods that were sent down the River\nRunning by the Elves of Mirkwood.\n\nThe Lakemens' main appearance in Tolkien's works comes in _The Hobbit_,\nwhen Thorin and Company escaped from Mirkwood by stowing away in barrels\nand floating down the river. The Dwarves entered the town and were\nwelcomed generously. The Dwarves stayed in Laketown for a few days, and\nthen made their way towards the mountain.

The dragon\nattacked Laketown and proceeded to burn it until he was killed by a\nBlack Arrow shot from Bard the captain of the guard, who held his ground\nwith a few loyal men while everyone else, including the town leader\nfled.\n\n\n\nOnce the Thorin's Thorin and Company realized that the dragon wasn't\ncoming back, they moved into the mountain and held it. Meanwhile, the\nelves of Mirkwood had been building up an army to go and claim some of\nthe hoard left by Smaug; also the goblins of the Misty Mountains also\nhad built an army to avenge the death of the Great Goblin. The Dwarves\nof the Iron Hills led by Dain also built an army to save Thorin and\nregain the Lonely Mountain for the Dwarves.

The Dwarves,\nelves, and armies of men met and were about to do battle when Gandalf\narrived and alerted them of the host of goblins. The three races, along\nwith the help of the great eagles, united to combat the massive goblin\narmy.

This marked the start of the\nyears when the Children of Ilúvatar were active in Middle-earth. Later\nin the First Age the second kindred, humans, and Ilúvatar's adopted\nchildren, the Dwarves, also awoke.\n\nTolkien wrote that the later Ages lasted about 3,000 years, though this\nduration was not fixed and he felt that the Ages 'sped up' over time.\nEach ended following the completion of some major event in the history\nof the Children of Ilúvatar.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn some texts Tolkien referred to the 'First Age of Middle-earth' or the\n'First Age of the World' rather than the 'First Age of the Children of\nIlúvatar'. These variations had earlier starting points, extending the\nFirst Age back to the creation of Arda, but consistently ended with\nMorgoth's defeat in Beleriand.\n\nThe terms 'First Age of the Sun' and 'Ages of the Sun' are commonly used\nby many fans, but do not appear anywhere in Tolkien's writings. The\n'First Age of the Sun' in this conception is held to begin with the\nfirst rising of the Sun and continue until Morgoth's defeat nearly 600\nyears later. While this is at odds with Tolkien's statements that the\nFirst Age was the longest by far it is a common misapprehension because\nthe subsequent ages all took place entirely during the Years of the Sun.\n\nThe time of Arda is typically rendered in Ages. Ages are one epoch of\nthe Valar. Before the arising of the Sun they were approximately one\nthousand Valian Years in length (the exact length of a Valian Year\nvaried in different drafts of Tolkien's texts from close to 10\n“Sun”-years in most versions to precisely 144 “Sun”-years in his final\nestimation). After the Sun Ages “sped up”, and length is more variable.\nThe Years of the Sun began with the 30th Valian Age, and the Fourth Age\nof Middle-earth began with the 37th Valian Age. However, only four, not\nseven Ages are counted. The Second and later Ages, during the Years of\nthe Sun, correspond more to the earlier Valarian Eras than to their\nAges.\n\n\nBrief Timeline\n\n    _For a much more detailed description of Timeline see: Timeline of\n    Arda_\n\n-   Before the Ainur were made.

So similar it was to Doriath like the\nSindar immediately settled there and were warmly welcomed by the Silvan\nElves. Through knowledge of the Sindar craft, the Silvan Elves were able\nto hone their skills with the bow and become master archers, now\noutfitted with new, shining weaponry and gear that only the Eldar could\nmake. But as for their own woodcraft, none could surpass the Silvan\nElves, who were already masters of the forest, able to hide in the\nshadows and remain undetected. Indeed, the “Silvan Shadow” was a trait\nnot even the Sindar could master. Thus the true Sentinel of the Forest\nwas born.\n\n\nGear\n\nThe weapons of the sentinel are few, easy to carry but extremely deadly.\nA standard warden would have a longbow, usually made of mallorn wood, an\nElven dagger, knife or handaxe and a quiver full of arrows, sometimes\ntipped with poison or barbed. A wealthier archer would probably have a\nshortsword as well, of Elven make of course. The armour of the Silvan\nsentinel is light as well, easily able to blend in with its\nsurroundings, whatever they may be. Indeed, the famous Lorien cloaks\nperform just this task. Apart from a cloak or mantle, the archer has a\nleather shirt, leggings, greaves, gauntlets, etc. He is very lightly\narmoured, for he is not expected to be heard by his enemy by the\njostling of mail or be forced into a prolonged fight. However a richer,\nmore elite archer may wear partial chainmail (always Elven made).\n\n\nEffectiveness ﻿\n\nA sentinel is quite deadly, provided he is well armed and he is covered\nby a woodland surrounding. His aim is not to hit and run, but rather to\nwipe out any foul and evil creature seen lurking in his zone of patrol,\nwithout being seen. During the War of the Ring, the sentinels were hard\nput to defending their borders, for the shadow of Dol Guldur had\nlaunched reparative raids on both woodland realms, ultimately\nculminating in the Battle Under the Trees, when the sentinel's finest\nhour had arrived. During the battle, the forces of Dol Guldur were\nbeaten back from Lórien and Thranduil's Halls and eventually the Hill of\nSorcery itself was laid bare by the White Lady of Lórien herself,\nGaladriel. This proves that the Silvan sentinel's effectiveness goes far\nand beyond that of any other woodsman in Middle-earth.\n\n\nDecline of the Sentinel\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, Mirkwood was made fair again but the time of\nthe Sindar had ended in Middle-earth. Thus, the Silvan Elves, who were\nof the Avari, remained in their dwindling kingdoms, but eventually their\npeople dwindled as well, so much so that they became only a memory, a\nlegend of elder days. The World has changed, Arda has been reshaped, but\nin the few forests that still exist on this earth, an ancient spirit or\ntwo of the Avari wardens may continue to dwell that has yet to see the\nfinal chapter of its history.\n\n\nSources\n\n-   The Fellowship of the Ring, Ch.

A\nmember of the Éoherë can serve a term or on a permanent basis.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the first three hundred-plus years of Rohan's existence, the term\n“Éored” was used widely to describe any significant number of Riders.\nUnder Folcwine King son of Folca, fourteenth King of the Mark, the\nmilitary of Rohan was reordered. Under Folcwine, one Éored was made up\nof 120 riders including their captain. Each Éored was also supposed to\ncomprise one one-hundredth of the whole Muster of Rohan, not including\nthe household of the King.\n\nAn Éored was a group of trained warriors who rode as a unit. Under the\nmilitary reorganization in the time of King Folcwine, the size of a full\nÉored was determined to be at least 120 men. One Éored was one hundredth\nof the Éoherë - the full muster of Rohan. The Riders of an Éored could\nserve for a term or on a permanent basis. A Captain led each Éored. In\ntimes of war or unrest, the Marshals of the Mark each had a battle-ready\nÉored as part of his household, which he could command at his\ndiscretion.\n\nThe changes made by Folcwine lasted through the time of the War of the\nRing. While the Éoherë commanded by Théoden King son of Thengel at the\nBattle of the Pelennor Fields did not number much more than half of the\n12,000 riders supossed to be a full muster of Rohan, it was possibly the\nlargest riding of the Rohirrim in history. Éowyn (disguised as a Rider\nnamed Dernhelm) and Merry Brandybuck rode with the Éored commanded by\nElfhelm to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields on March 15. When the\nRohirrim charged onto the battlefield, Éomer led the first Éored in the\ncenter while Elfhelm's Éored was on the right flank and Grimbold's was\non the left flank and the other companies followed behind. King Théoden\nrode before them all.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word ÉOHERË comes from the Anglo-Saxon Old English (which the tongue\nof Rohan was modelled after); it is made up of the words EOH meaning\n“horse” and HERË meaning “army.” Likewise Éored contains the words 'eoh'\nand 'rád' (horse, riding or rode).\n\npl:Éoherë"

They never pledged any kind of\nallegiance to the Elf King, however, and lived in his realm as free men.\nHaleth became the leader of the House after her father and brother were\nslain in an Orc raid. Upon assuming control, she led her men to survive\na brutal Orc raid on their camp. On the seventh day of the raid,\nCaranthir arrived with reinforcements and helped fend off the rest of\nthe Orcs. Impressed by their victory, he offered the Men of Brethil a\nfiefdom in his kingdom, and in turn, the protection of his soldiers.\nHaleth refused this, however, for she was a proud person, and likely\nwished to retain freedom for her people.\n\nThe Men of Brethil were then led by Haleth to the Forest of Brethil in\nKing Finrod Felagund's land. They defended the Crossing of the Teiglin\nRiver from an enemy attack, and in return, King Finrod awarded them the\nfreedom to settle and be a separate people within his realm.\n\nOnce Haleth died, Haldad assumed the role of the leader of the Haladin\nHouse."

It eventually came to be part\nof the Dwarven treasure hoard of the Lonely Mountain. It was found by\nthe dragon Smaug and added to his treasure heap. Here, it was given by\nThorin II Oakenshield to the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, who wore it during\nthe Battle of Five Armies. After returning to the Shire, Bilbo loaned\nthe shirt to the Mathom-house. Before departing the Shire for Rivendell,\nBilbo reclaimed the shirt and wore it on that journey.\n\nMany years later it was given by Bilbo to his nephew Frodo Baggins as\nFrodo set out on his quest to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Frodo\nwore the chain shirt under his tunic unknown to the rest of the\nFellowship. It was discovered when, during a skirmish in the mines of\nMoria, an Orc chieftain stabbed Frodo with a spear. The shirt\nprevented what would have been a lethal wound, leaving Frodo badly\nbruised but otherwise uninjured.\n\nThe shirt was confiscated from Frodo in the Tower of Cirith Ungol. The\ntwo squadrons of orcs that captured Frodo fought over the valuable\nshirt, and most were killed during the conflict. One of the two Orc\nleaders, Shagrat, survived the fight and seized the shirt, escaping the\ntower with it.

They were made around the same\ntime as the Rings of Power and there were, presumably, many of them\nsince “In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made” and there are\nonly twenty Rings of Power, unless twenty is considered “many” rings.\nGandalf states that though the Elves who forged them thought little of\nthem, he still thinks they are dangerous for mortals.\n\nThey are lesser rings of the Rings of Power, forged by the Elves as\n“essays in the craft”- they bore no gem (similar to the One Ring).\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the ancient days of the Second Age, before the Fall of Númenor, many\nrings were forged, the craft being taught by Sauron. These rings aided\nin the use of spells and magical craft, and thus were widely popular\nwith the Elves. Sauron, then known as “Lord of the Gifts” claimed he\nwished to make Middle-earth as fair as Valinor, and it seemed he\nconvinced the elves to think these rings could do so.\n\nAfter the forging of the One Ring, Sauron began drawing these lesser\nrings to himself. This was not difficult, for the One Ring gave him the\nstrength to subdue the wielders of these powerful artifacts. Once\ngathered, Sauron could disperse them among his captains, making them all\nmighty champions whom he could back up at will with his own strength via\nthe magic ring connection. After the Last Alliance of Elves and Men and\nthe First Fall of Sauron, these rings were dispersed through the land.\nSome were taken from dead warriors, others, borne away by the\nfrightened, still living servants of Sauron, others were lost and little\nis known of what happened to them until the War of the Ring.\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring, Sauron gathered again the lesser\nrings to himself. But this time, he kept a great deal of them so as to\nadvance his own abilities. Though not stated in the books or movies, it\nseems reasonable to believe that some were given again to his commanders\nas well, and logically some were lost or destroyed before they could be\nreclaimed. \n\nTheir ultimate fates are unknown, nor is it known whether or not their\npowers were bound to the power of the One Ring. If they were, then their\npower would have failed with the destruction of the One.\n\n\nPowers\n\nThe full extent of the rings' power is unknown, but Gandalf says that\n“none are to be used lightly”. They were, to an extent, like the One\nRing when it came to temptation. They would give a being strength,\nmagical ability, and the power to dominate other wills.\n\nIt is also believed (though again, not stated) that these rings also had\ncertain fields in which they were strongest. For example, one ring may\nrule over stone, while another controls ice. This, however, is not known\nfact, and only stems from what is known about the Rings of Power,\nassuming that the lesser rings are much like them."

One of his subjects, Nuin Father of\nSpeech, came to a hidden valley of great loveliness and found there\nsleeping figures young but not children, boys and girls: the Fathers of\nMen. He told this to Tu, who fell into great fear of the One, and told\nNuin that these were the Fathers of Men, who were to be undisturbed.\nNotes then tell that Nuin awoke two of the Sleepers, Ermon and Elmir,\nand taught them speech; that Tu and Nuin shepherded the Sleepers when\nthey awoke with the Sun, and that Men split into factions in the years\nafterward. Tu grew to shun day and took to dwelling underground. A demon\nnamed Fankil, son of Melkor, arose and set Men at each other's throats,\nand especially against the Elves. The folk of Ermon stood with the\nElves, but Tu came forth and destroyed Fankil, and was buried under\nfalling hills.\n\nWhat manner of being Tu was, shall doubtless never be known, other than\nthat he was no Elf, nor Wizard, nor any of the incarnate Maiar, but a\nnew thing entirely, even as Bombadil and Goldberry doubtless are.

He\nfought against the Nazgûl and was able to drive most of them away.\nHowever, noticing the Witch-King approaching, Frodo put on the One Ring\nin attempt to hide from the Witch-King. That proved to have no effect\nwhen the Witch-king saw him in the wraith-world, and stabbed his\nshoulder with a Morgul-blade.\n\nFrodo fainted, but took off the Ring before losing consciousness\ncompletely.

    "text": "History\n\nBackground\n\nIn the ages prior to the sun, Arda was reformed by the massive energy\nreleased when Melkor destroyed the original light sources, the two\nLamps. The Valar fled the razing to the newly formed continent of Aman\nand built Valinor, while Melkor reigned unchecked in the new continent\nof Middle-earth, where he corrupted the surviving beasts. Unaware of\nthese designs, the Valar did not approach him for fear that the\nconfrontation would be just as world-devastating as the extinguishment\nof the light. Their priority was to protect the original plan of\ncreation, though they were unsure of what was salvageable. They did not\nknow if Eru's personal creations, elves and men, would now ever come\ninto being after the catastrophe.\n\nFortunately, the elves did come to being; however, they appeared in\nMiddle-earth near Cuiviénen. Withdrawn, the Valar were unaware of this.\nOn the other hand, Melkor was quickly learned of this through his spies.\nSoon, elves who wandered too far from their lands were captured and\ntaken to the fortresses of Angband and Utumno. There, in Melkor's utmost\ncontempt for Eru and his sole ability to create life, they were\ncorrupted through torture into servants bred solely for war - orcs.\n\nSometime later, while on a hunting trip in Middle-earth, the Valar Oromë\nstumbled upon the elves that were unharmed. After realizing what they\nwere, he asked them to return with him to Valinor for their protection.\nWhile the majority of them agreed, a some refused, believing him to be\ntheir kidnapper. When Oromë returned with the elves willing to leave\nwith him, the Valar were made aware of orcs. Their creation was\nmost-likely seen as the worst imaginable offense. Manwë and the rest of\nthe Valar could stand this no longer, and so the Valar took counsel with\neach other and decided to rid Middle-earth of Melkor's tyranny.\n\nThe War\n\nSoon, the Valar declared war on Melkor, presumably a massive army of\nlight and battled him for many decades. The Host of the Valar easily\ndefeated Melkor's host at the Battle of the Powers in northwestern\nMiddle-earth. The remnant of his forces fled back to Utumno and\nfortified themselves there. The Valar passed over Middle-earth and\nplaced a guard over Cuiviénen to protect the elves from any further\neffects of the war or perhaps from an attack from Melkor's servants.\nThen, the Host of the Valar went north to Utumno and besieged it. After\ndecades of siege, the Host of the Valar finally broke through and after\nTulkas himself personally defeated Melkor in combat, they captured him\nand took him to Valinor for judgment, and sentenced him to prison in the\nHalls of Mandos for thousands of years.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe war between the two powers devastated the lands of Middle-earth and\nthe face of the continent was changed. The distance between Middle-earth\nand Aman separated by the Great Sea became wider. A Gulf in south was\ncreated and small bays appeared between the Great Gulf and Helcaraxë.\nThe Mountains of Hithlum and the highlands of the Dorthonion were\ncreated. The Sirion river that flowed into the newly formed Bay of Balar\nappeared. Free of evil, the elves were invited to Valinor and undertook\na Great Journey across Middle-earth in which new Elven cultures were\ndeveloped. The result was the peopling and colonisation of the western\nparts of Middle-earth with the Children of Ilúvatar.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe main legacy of war was that it allowed the Elves to go to Aman and\nValinor where they became High Elves, enlightened, cultured, and\nskilled. Elves in Middle-earth established themselves learning much of\nnature, woodlore, and shipbuilding. However, the fear brought about by\nMelkor caused some elves to relent and stay in the east longer. These\nelves, the Avari and the rest of the Dark Elves developed separate and\nmore secretive cultures and stayed away from the affairs of their long\nloss brethren for the most part. They would then thousands and thousands\nof years later in the Third and Fourth Ages become the Wood-elves that\nwould be the last of the kindreds of left in Middle-earth ever after.\nThe languages of the elves spread throughout Middle-earth and blended\nand influenced other tongues and became known of ever after.\n\nThe other legacy was that Melkor, then released from prison who would\never after remember that his downfall was because of the Elves sought\nrevenge thus causing the Revolt of the Ñoldor and the War of the Jewels\nand the battles and dramas that followed. It would also serve to\nshape the course of the history of the Children of Ilúvatar for ages to\ncome."

Tolkien participated in the battle and witnessed\nfirsthand the carnage, suffering, and terrible losses of life. The\nresult was that it was to have a profound effect on Tolkien's works,\nmost notably _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\nTolkien's good friends Robert Gilson and Geoffrey Bache Smith were\nkilled in the battle.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe battle started on the 1 July 1916 after a heavy artillery\nbombardment on the German lines that had begun a week before on 24 June\n1916. The battle was intended to be a decisive breakthrough for the\nallies against the Central Powers, but it did not turn out that way. The\nbattle ended on the 18 November 1916. In the space of just over four\nmonths, the battle produced over one million casualties and was\nindecisive and although the allies gained ground (only five miles total)\nthey did not break through the German lines and win the war.\n\nThe battle was fought on the Western Front in the north-central Somme\nand southeastern Pas-de-Calais Départements, of France.\n\nTolkien's role\n\nTolkien's involvement in the battle lasted from July to October 1916\nduring which he served as a Battalion Signalling Officer to the 11th\nBattalion of The Lancashire Fusiliers. His unit operated mainly in the\nnorthern section of the Somme and was stationed in the Beaumont-Hamel,\nSerre, and Leipzig salient trenches. He was in the Battle of Thiepval\nRidge and helped captured the Regina Trench from the Germans for a time.\nThe filthy and wretched conditions of the trenches and areas of battle\nalong with stress caused Tolkien to come down with Trench fever and\nTrench foot, which put him out of the war permanently.\n\n\nAftermath and Effects on Writing\n\nWhile in hospital recovering from his diseases of war, Tolkien did much\nwriting where his experiences in the battle were where many of the ideas\nfor the terrible battles of the War of the Ring and the epic Fall of\nGondolin, which were outlined in _The Lord of the Rings_ and the _Book\nof Lost Tales_. Another theme which grew out of Tolkien's participation\nin the battle was the struggles of ordinary peoples in extraordinary\nsituations and that the smallest of people can make big contributions\nand differences. Possibly, Tolkien was inspired by the great potential,\nbravery, and hardiness he saw in the ordinary low-ranked citizen\nsoldiers that fought in the battle."

However, the tide turned in favor\nof the goblins when the Balrog known as Durin's Bane emerged and led a\nmassive army of goblins in a counter-attack. No dwarf of the colony\nsurvived.\n\n\nHistory\n\n48 years after the Battle of the Five Armies, Balin along with Flói,\nÓin, Ori, Frár, Lóni, Náli, and a large colony of Dwarves marched from\nthe Lonely Mountain to Moria to reclaim the dwarven city with the\nunwilling leave of Dain II Ironfoot as he feared what was there. He\nhoped to reclaim some of the lost treasures of the lost realm like the\nRing of Thrór. The initial battles took place from the Dimrill Dale to\nthe Chamber of Mazarbul in which Flói was killed before they reached the\nFirst Hall. Nevertheless everything went well as the Dwarves proved to\nbe fiercely determined to take back their home, slaying every goblin in\ntheir path, eventually some of Moria was reclaimed and they dwelt in the\nTwenty-first Hall until Balin moved to the Chamber of Mazarbul which\nthen become his seat of government from then on. For the next few years,\nBalin ruled as Lord of Moria. The goblins became a mere nuisance during\nthose years and were not serious threats. Here, Balin and company found\nDurin's Axe and some sort of 'helm'.\n\nLittle did the Dwarves know, that Moria was ruled by a Balrog, a demon\nof the Eldar Days that survived in the deeps for many thousands of years\nthat the Dwarves were no match for. By the year TA 2994, Durin's Bane\nand a horde of goblins launched a massive counterattack from the east.\nBalin was shot by an archer and died in Dimrill Dale and many other\nDwarves perished as well and retreated into the mines. Bloody fighting\ntook place all over Moria, but the strength of the Dwarves were\nultimately no match for the sheer number of goblins and the power of the\nBalrog. Soon the Bridge of Khazad-dum and the Second Hall were taken by\nthe goblins. Frár and Lóni and Náli were among the casualties the\nDwarves lost in the second hall. Oin and a group of Dwarves tried to\nescape through the Doors of Durin but were killed by the Watcher in the\nWater. The last Dwarves barred the doors of the Chamber of Mazarbul and\nwere able to built a tomb for Balin. Eventually, the goblins broke\nthrough and slew the remaining Dwarves ending the peaceful\nre-colonization of Moria.\n\n\nAftermath\n\nWith the Dwarven colony destroyed, Moria continued to be a place of evil\nthat none dared enter until the Fellowship of the Ring learned of it\nwhen they passed through it, slaying Durin's Bane in the process.\n"

    "title": "Origin of Dragons",
    "page_id": "22367",
    "text": "There is significant debate over the ORIGINS OF DRAGONS in\nMiddle-earth.\n\n\nExtreme Intelligence\n\n[Tolkien's portraits about his ideas of dragons in Middle-Earth.\nDragons were known to be very intelligent. This has led many to think\nthat the theory which suggests that dragons are merely corrupted beasts\nis false. For example David Day writes,  “The intelligence of Dragons\nwas renowned, as was their love of setting and solving riddles. Dragons\n. . . were creatures of immense cleverness and knowledge but not of\nwisdom, for their intelligence had the flaws of vanity, gluttony, greed,\ndeceit and wrath.”\n\n\nDifferent Theories\n\n-   The theory that Dragons were simply beasts physically enhanced by\n    Morgoth, such as corrupted eagles, is a very popular theory, but\n    there are issues with this line of thought. Randall Johnson\n    writes: “Dragons understand many tongues, and they are known for\n    speaking in riddles. Dragons are very intelligent, able to lead\n    armies into battle. Dragons are able to petrify and hypnotize with\n    but a glance of their eyes.  Dragons cast spells and curses. Some\n    Dragons breathe fire. These properties and powers are not\n    characteristic of simple beasts”. Another problem is, of course that\n    dragons did not originally have wings.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The theory that dragons are sparks of the spirit of Melkor has\n    merit. According to this theory, Melkor bred monstrous reptiles and\n    poured a portion of his own spirit into them, giving them\n    semi-independent wills and consciousnesses.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   One theory claims that dragons find their origins in Yavanna's\n    creation; they were born to be part of Arda's ecosystems just as\n    other animals, or were specifically created to serve as guardians\n    who would protect the harmony and peace of nature like the Eagles.\n    These beasts were then later (or even before the spread of their\n    races across Arda) altered and corrupted by the Dark Lord and\n    adopted into his forces. Gigantic reptilian races such as dinosaurs,\n    Megalanias, Titanoboas, and the Fell Beasts might or might not have\n    shared their origins with dragons according to this theory. This\n    fits with the origin of Orcs, which are descended from corrupted\n    Elves as well as the assertion that only Eru is capable of creating\n    life.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The next theory is that dragons are simply embodied Maiar much like\n    the Balrogs. This theory avoids many of the problems of the previous\n    ideas on draconic origins. According to this theory, dragons are\n    Maiar, ancient spirits in the form of gigantic, serpentine\n    monsters. The fact that Maiar have the ability to take on corporeal\n    forms has been established previously. Melkor's deadly allies, the\n    Balrogs, were Maiar in the raiment of fire and shroud. The Wizards\n    were Maiar in the form of Men or Elves.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The final theory is that dragons are actually descendants of\n    embodied Maiar and beasts (more likely monsters or Nameless Things)\n    much like Ungoliant procreates with spiders. This theory is\n    generally considered to have great strength by Middle-earth\n    experts. Johnson writes: “ theory contends that at some\n    point in time, a Maia, according to the bidding of Melkor, assumed a\n    bodily form genetically compatible with an existing reptile. Recall\n    that Sauron himself took the form of a serpent. 'Then Sauron shifted\n    shape, from wolf to serpent, and from monster to his own accustomed\n    form.' (Silmarillion, 212) This serpent-Maia mated with the reptile,\n    procreating the first Dragon, Glaurung. Glaurung then mated either\n    with other existing reptiles or with other serpent-Maiar in order to\n    reproduce.  Eventually, the Dragons became a self-sustainable race.”"

    "text": "The FIRST SACK OF DORIATH, or the SACK OF MENEGROTH, was an attack on\nDoriath by the Dwarves of Nogrod in the late First Age.\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe cause of the attack was the Dwarves' desire to possess the Silmaril,\nset in the dwarven-made jewel, the Nauglamir, for themselves. After the\ntwo treasures were brought together, Thingol sought to take it and set\nabout it his neck but the Dwarves withheld it from him, saying that he\nhadn't the right to do so as it was a dwarven heirloom taken from\nNargothrond by theft. Then in a gesture of great pride, Thingol scorned\nthe dwarves as inferiors undeserving in comparison to himself and\nproceeded to speak ill of them, deeming they should be gone out of his\nrealm forever. Insulted and ever wanting the Silmaril, the Dwarves'\nhearts kindled to rage and they fell upon him and there was a great\nbattle within the palace, Thingol was seemingly defeated, and took the\nNauglamir and the Silmaril, but were driven out of the fortress.\n\nThe Dwarves left Menegroth, but it didn't take long for the alarm to be\nraised on what had been done, and soon all of Doriath was roused. With\ngreat wrath, the dwarves were pursued to the death and all but two\nreturned home to Nogrod. When they arrived, the survivors lied about\nwhat really happened, saying that their brothers had been slain at the\ncommand of the Thingol, hoping to cheat them of their reward. The\nDwarves of Nogrod then became filled will wrath and desired revenge.\nThey tried to get the Dwarves of Belegost to help them but they refused.\n\nLater the Dwarves were allowed past the Girldle with the help of\ntreacherous elves who were under the curse of the treasure. Meanwhile\nThingol was lured out of the fortress on a hunt with only a small\ncompany of arms. The dwarves were waiting for him an ambush finally slew\nthe king, and the fortress of the THousand Caves was taken unawares and\nplundered, bringing well nigh to ruin the glory of Doriath.\n\nMelian, full of grief and pain at the loss of her husband and seeing\nthat that the doom she had so feared had finally come upon Doriath,\nwithdrew her protection of the realm. The dwarves could neither harm nor\nseize her and she went forth...\n\nHere there is a split in the accounts...\n\nIn Beren and Luthien (2017) to sought after Beren and Luthien, to warn\nhem of the Dwarves approach. Giving them a chance with help of the\nGreen Elves to stop the Dwarves at the battle of the Stony Ford. Melien\nalso tells Beren the dangers of the Mim's cursed treasure, and has\ndiscussions with her daughter Luthien. She gives the Silmaril to Beren\nfor safe keeping. In time Luthien faded, and Beren died, and their son\nDior became heir to Doriath (taking the Silmaril with him) and helped\nraise its glory anew, though Melian dwelt in that place, and she\nreturned back to and of the Gods.\n\nAlternatively another somewhat later account (closer to how it appears\nin The Silmarillion (1977)) Dior leaves later while his family was still\nalive and become the new king of Doriath. It was when Green Elves\nbrought him a coffer with the Necklace of the Dwarves, that he knew his\nparents had died. He stared at the Silmaril long with grief that death\nhad come upon his parents so soon.\n\nIn the Silmarillion (1977), the co-author Guy Kay was tasked with coming\nup with an explanation for why the girdle/veil of Melian was brought\ndown to allow dwarves back into the city to sack it. It is not clear how\nmuch of it was J.R. Tolkiens ideas and how much of it was Guy Kay's but\nUnfinished Tales and HoMe series attribute much of that chapter as a\nconstruction of Kays.\n\nIn the story as it appears in Of the Sacking of Doriath, she entrusted\nMablung to send word to Beren at Tol Galen and gave him the Silmaril for\nsafe-keeping. She then left Middle-earth and returned to Valinor leaving\nDoriath vulnerable.\n\nAs per HoMe Christopher Tolkien mentions never being fully happy with\nhaving used a construction (that was not wholly of his fathers) and in\nhindsight and with discovery of later works of his father (which\nincluded the intent to go back and incorporate much of the elements of\nthe earlier stories), he admits he could have retained much the elements\nof both accounts, with very little editorial involvement (and should\nhave included the extended parts of the story). In the 2017 Beren and\nLuthien work, he has reached that goat to a certain degree.\n\n\n\n\nThe Attack\n\nThe Dwarves of Nogrod assembled a great host and marched out of the Blue\nMountains, crossing the river Gelion, and headed westward to Doriath.\nCrossing the Aros River, the Dwarves reached Doriath with no magical\nenchantments (i.e. the Girdle of Melian) or barriers to stop them. The\nElven sentinels and their captains there were no match for them, and\nwere quickly defeated; then with few losses the Dwarves passed over the\ngreat Bridge of Menegroth, and entered the caves thus beginning the\nBattle of the Thousand Caves. After fierce fighting in which many on\nboth sides were killed, they were victorious and pillaged, plundered,\nand destroyed at their leisure and much was taken from the Great Hall of\nThingol. Then, they came to the the treasury and slew Mablung before its\ndoors and took the Nauglamir and the Silmaril.\n\n\nAfterwards\n\nThe Dwarves left Doriath but didn't live to enjoy the fruits of their\nvictory. At Sarn Athrad, they were ambushed by an army of Laiquendi led\nby Beren with his son Dior. The Dwarven host, heavily weighed-down with\nloot, were destroyed and the survivors that fled into the forest ran\ninto the Ents and were killed. The Silmaril and Nauglamir were taken by\nBeren to Tol Galen. This marked the end of the first kingdom of Doriath\nuntil Dior and his wife Nimloth came to refounded it later ruling over\nthe surviving Sindar, soon afterwards.\n"

In the Second Age, Sauron\ncorrupted and combined Valarin and Quenya to create Black Speech, which\nhe intended to make the official language of all who served him. He\nultimately failed in this purpose, although several generations of Orcs\nwere probably bred in Mordor and raised on this language before the War\nof the Last Alliance.\n\nAfter Sauron's defeat at the end of the Second Age the Orcs were\ndivided. Eventually they had almost as many dialects as they had groups\nand settlements, and “Orkish” quickly became useless to them for\ninter-breed communication. So most Orcs learned to speak a debased form\nof Westron for this purpose. By the late Third Age the Goblin tribes of\nthe Misty Mountains adopted this primitive dialect as their official\nlanguage, and Saruman later had it taught to the Half-orcs and Uruk-hai\nof Isengard. The Black Uruks and Uruk-hai of Mordor also spoke Westron,\nbut their first language was a debased form of Black Speech combined\nwith Orkish. There was also a new breed of small tracker Orcs known as\n“Snufflers” originally bred in Mordor. These particular Orcs spoke\nWestron in the company of Uruk-hai and Black Uruks, which meant that\nthey did not share the same language, and instead had their own language\nor knew only Westron."

The Citadel\nwould have been around 500 feet across.\n\n\nLayout\n\nThe Citadel is set out this way: In the centre is the White Tower,\nrising to a great height. Behind is the large sprawling King's House,\nwhere the Kings of Gondor once lived. In front of the tower is the Place\nof the Fountain, a courtyard containing the White tree and a central\nfountain. Around the Tower are ringed several other important buildings,\nincluding Merethrond, the Feasting Hall. The Citadel is accessed via a\nwide tunnel through the hill that leads to a small gate. The wide cliff\nnarrows to its point around 200 feet beyond the Citadel. As with all the\ncity's levels, the Citadel has a high wall and seven towers.\n\n\nThe Place of the Fountain\n\nProbably the most important symbolic area of the city, the Place of the Fountain was the\nhome of the great White Tree. It was a large circular grass area, around\n50 feet wide, with the White Tree being the central feature. The\nfountain was positioned some way before the tree. It flowed into a small\npool, then back round to the fountain. The Tree symbolised Gondor, and\nwas the flag and emblem of the City Guards. The Tree was grown from a\nseed of Nimloth, the tree given to the Númenóreans by the Eldar. It was\nplanted by Isildur, and grew to symbolise the blessings of Men. But in\nthe third age the tree was withered, perhaps symbolising Minas Tirith's\ndecline. It was only with the crowning of Aragorn Elessar that a new\nsapling was founded, showing the City's rise to glory under the new\nKing.\n\n\nThe Tower and other buildings\n\nThe Tower of Ecthelion is a tall white stone structure, rising 300 feet\nabove the citadel. The elevation of the city means it's topmost floor is\n1000 feet above the Pelennor Fields. It's name implies that it was\nprobably built by Denethor's father, Ecthelion, but it was possibly much\nolder. The Tower was used as a main business building, and contained\nseveral large council halls, and the imposing Throne Room. At the summit was the small\nchamber where Denethor kept Minas Tirith's Palantir. At the very bottom\nof the Tower, there were several rooms for the Guards of the City to\nlive and work in.\n\nThe House of Kings was a large building, with many halls and towers. As\none of the main buildings in the city, it would have been around 100\nfeet long. It was designed to accommodate the King and royal family,\nvisitors, guests and a large team of servants. The palace was no longer\nin use by the time Gandalf and Pippin came to the city; the last King,\nEärnur, having long since been killed.\n\nThe only other building Tolkien specifically mentioned was Merethrond,\nthe Hall of Feasts. This is where important guests to the city were\nentertained, and where important feasts and celebrations were held.\n\nThere were several other structures on the citadel, ringed around the\nTower, but none apart from the White Tower and the Feast Hall are\nimportant to the story of lord of the rings."

It was guarded by the tower of Barad Eithel.\n\n\nCourse\n\nSirion flowed southwards along the border of the Ered Wethrin, passing\nthrough the Fen of Serech before entering the narrow steep-sided valley\nbetween the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath named the Pass of Sirion.\nSirion then continued south into Beleriand, with the Forest of Brethil\nto the west, and Dimbar and then Doriath to the east.

King\nThingol of Doriath also kept secret ferries in Doriath to cross the\nriver.\n\n\nSettlements\n\nBarad Eithel, at the source of the Sirion in the Ered Wethrin, was a\nchief fortress of Fingolfin and his son Fingon, which guarded the pass\ninto their realm of Mithrim. Further south, in the Pass of Sirion, lay\nTol Sirion (see below). After the Coming of Men, the Edainof the House\nof Haleth made their home in the Forest of Brethil, and the Sindar ruled\nby Thingol lay secure within the Girdle of Melian in their realm of\nDoriath. At the outflow of Sirion into Belegaer, after the\ndestruction of Eglarest and Brithombar, the Havens of Sirion were built\nby Círdan and his people.\n\n\nIslands\n\nThe most important island in Sirion was Tol Sirion. The original Minas\nTirith was built here by Finrod Felagund in the strategic location\ncontrolling the Pass of Sirion where it entered Beleriand between the\nEred Wethrin and the Echoriath. Shortly after Dagor Bragollach it was\ncaptured by Sauron and the island became known as Tol-in-Gaurhoth.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nSirion is a Sindarin/Noldorin name which contains the element sîr.\nDepending on the meaning of the second element, the name could either\nmean “great river” or “land of waters” (-ion as augmentative suffix or\narchaic plural genitive suffix).\n\nIts name in Khuzdul was Gabilān, with the element Gabil - “Great”."

    "text": "DARK SORCERY, more commonly known as “witchcraft” or “Morgul magic” by\nthe Free People of Middle-earth, was art of practicing dark magic for\nevil purposes. Famous practitioners of dark sorcery are mostly dark\nservants of the infamous Dark Lords Melkor and Sauron. Its users, as\nwell as all human practitioners of magic, were called Sorcerers. The\nIstari used light magic, similar to the Elves and the Ainur in Valinor\nand outside of Arda, rather than dark sorcery.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nBefore his defeat, the Dark Lord Morgoth (Melkor) had used dark sorcery\nin his fortress of Utumno and later Angband. He was most infamous for\nhis experiments in creating and mutilating monsters, including the orcs,\nWargs and Dragons and used much of his powers to corrupt Arda.\n\nDark sorcery was also used in the Second and the Third Age by the Black\nNúmenóreans, a group of corrupted Númenóreans who grew during the later\nperiod of Númenor (especially after the arrival of Sauron) and who\nsurvived in the Númenórean colonies south of Gondor. Originally the\nstyled themselves as “King's Men” and persecuted The “Elf-friends”\nbecause of their loyalty to the Valar (The King's Men had grown jealous\nof the elves' immortality). After Sauron's arrival at Númenor they begun\nworshipping Melkor and the darkness they so feared, bringing human\nsacrifices to him. After the fall of Númenor the Black Númenóreans\ncontinued to serve Sauron. Two Black Númenóreans who were infamous for\nusing sorcery within Sauron's armies were the Witch-king of Angmar and\nthe Mouth of Sauron.\n\nAt around the late Third Age, in the fortress of Dol Guldur, the\nNecromancer (Sauron in disguise) was believed to be an Úlairi. He was\neventually forced out by the White Council, but he returned to his\nformer kingdom of Mordor and publicly declared himself alive, shown as\nMount Doom erupted once again.\n\nAfter Sauron's final destruction that began the Fourth Age, a Man by the\nname of Herumor had rose to power and was rumored to have established a\ncult that worshipped the Dark Powers in Gondor.\n\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nDark sorcery included a variety of spells, potions (alchemy) and other\nghastly things that belonged to the Dark Arts. Dark sorcery was\nfrequently used as a weapon, shown by the Witch-king's bewitched sword\nat the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.\n\nMorgul-blades were noted to have been enchanted with dark sorcery, so\nthat a victim would go through the Shadow World and turn into a wraith\nif stabbed.\n\nThe Fires of Orthanc were said to be sorcery invented or created by\nSaruman.\n\nMany of the Rings of Power (the only known exception being the three\nElf-rings) amplified the wearers abilities as a sorcerer and warrior and\nwhere presumably forged with the help of Dark Magic. The fortresses of\nDol Guldur and Minas Morgul were enchanted with sorcery, hence their\ntranslated names in Sindarin. \n\n\nKnown Practitioners\n\nPractitioners of dark sorcery were named 'Sorcerers' and these included:\n\n-   All the Dark Powers\n    -   Melkor\n    -   Sauron\n        -   Dark Servants of Sauron\n            -   Mouth of Sauron\n            -   Herumor\n            -   Saruman\n            -   Nazgûl\n                -   Witch-king of Angmar"

    "text": "The BATTLE OF THE THOUSAND CAVES was a great battle between the Dwarves\nof Nogrod and the Elves of Doriath in the Caves of Menegroth.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nAfter the Quest for the Silmaril and the Hunting of the Wolf, Thingol\ncame to possess the Silmaril that Beren cut from Morgoth's Iron Crown.\nThen around FA 500, Hurin, freshly released from his long imprisonment\nby the Dark Lord appeared and presented to the King the Nauglamír that\nhe took from Mîm at Nargothrond. Seeing that he now possessed the two\nmost beautiful things ever created by the Children of Ilúvatar, Thingol\ndesired to combine them into one great creation. From this, he\ncontracted the Dwarven craftsmen working in his smithies who were\nstrongly motivated because the Nauglamir was a creation of their own\nrace, and they too desired the Silmaril but hid it well.\n\nLong did they labor in the deep smithies of Menegroth and when the\nmarvelous creation was complete, King Thingol came to claim it but the\nDwarves coveted it and withheld it from him saying he had no right to\nit. Seeing their true minds, Thingol scorned the Dwarves with hurtful\nwords in praise of himself. Then, the Dwarves unable to bear anymore\nrose before him and slew him then and there took the Nauglamír and the\nSilmaril within it and fled. The killers managed to get out of Menegroth\nbut not out of the realm for word quickly spread on who was responsible\nand the Dwarves were pursued to the death. Most of them were killed and\nthe Nauglamír and Silmaril returned to Doriath. Only two Dwarves\nescaped. Melian, unable to bear the loss of her husband and seeing that\nthat the doom she had so feared had finally come upon Doriath withdrew\nher protection, and entrusted Mablung to send word to Beren at Tol Galen\nand gave him the Silmaril for safe-keeping. She then left Middle-earth\nand returned to Valinor.\n\nPrelude\n\nThe two surviving Dwarves that made it back to Nogrod and when asked\nwhat had happened they lied to their Lord saying that their brethren\nwere slain on the command of Thingol, who intended not to pay them for\ntheir works. Then, great anger came to the Dwarves and the halls of\nNogrod filled with their wrath, and the Dwarves prepared for war\nintending to avenge this wrong. They tried to get the Dwarves of\nBelegost to help but they refused and also tried to dissuade them from\ntheir intent, but they did not succeed. The Dwarves marched westward\nthrough the Beleriand with a great host, and all trembled at the sight\nof host of the Dwarves. They passed through the now open and unguarded\nborders of Doriath, and no one opposed them and retreated before them.\nThen, the host came to Menegroth, crossed the Bridge of Menegroth and\nentered the caves and so the battle begun.\n\nThe Battle\n\nThe battle took place entirely underground in the many thousands of the\nCaves of Menegroth. It is not known how long the two foes fought one\nanother only that many died on both sides but the Dwarves emerged\nvictorious.\n\nAftermath\n\nAfter the Dwarves won the battle, they pillaged and plundered all they\ncould and then eager to get their hands on the Nauglamir and the\nSilmaril, they came to the treasury of the realm and slew Mablung before\nits doors taking both the treasures. Doriath was sacked but the Dwarves\ndid not claim the realm and instead left for home. Doriath ceased to be\nwithout the King or his Queen. Even Beren's avenging of the defeat at\nSarn Athrad did not resurrect the kingdom, not until the coming of age\nof Beren's son Dior. The battle also remained in the racial memories of\nboth the Elves and Dwarves for many ages to come."

The earlier king was the first to fully\nembrace the necessity of a strong navy, and through its use extended the\ninfluence of Gondor around the Mouths of Anduin. On March 13 3019,\nshortly before the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, some hundreds of\nfishermen went to aid Minas Tirith without a captain. Much later,\nAragorn vanquished a brief Umbarian invasion of the area. Aragorn, along\nwith Grey Company and the Army of the Dead, liberated Pelargir and the\nsurrounding Anduin estuary from the Corsairs of Umbar, after having\nprogressively pushed them out of the delta for much of that week.\nBecause the victory on 13 March was so complete, Umbar was left with no\ntools to effect its sovereignty. Thus, what might be thought of as the\n“Battle of Ethir Anduin” led directly to Umbar's reintegration with\nGondor in Aragorn's Reunited Kingdom.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe land on the delta was long settled by Men, and indeed it was a rich\nsource of Mannish culture. Part of the reason for this was because it\nwas contested between different types of Men, probably including groups\nlike the Nandorians and Haradrim, but definitely including\nNúmenóreans, Gondorians and Umbarians. Early Westron was said to have\ndeveloped there. The reason for the region's importance to the\ndevelopment of Mannish language was likely because the lands of the\ndelta supported Men of all stations in life, from lowly “lesser men” who\nwere largely fishermen and other folk dependent on the sea, as well as\nthe loftier Númenóreans."

From TA 830 to TA 1149, these kings\nworked hard at, and were largely successful at, adding territory to\nGondor with their increasingly superior naval might. The Ship-kings\npushed the boundaries of Gondor to the south and to the west, such that\nGondor came to include land down to the Mouths of Anduin and Umbar and\neven south of the River Harnen. Indeed, it was under the Ship-kings that\nGondor achieved the zenith of its influence, at least until the\ncoming of Aragorn and the Reunited Kingdom.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFalastur began the building of great fleets of ships that increased\nGondor's power in Middle-earth down past the Mouths of Anduin. Eärnil I\nrebuilt the ancient haven of the Faithful Pelargir and from here built a\ngreat fleet to conquer the enemy realm of Umbar. In TA 933, Eärnil's\nnavy and armies attacked Umbar and won it from the Southrons and their\nBlack Númenórean masters. Afterwards, it became an important part of\nGondor, serving as a great harbor and fortress of Gondor.

At this time, the Men from the Vales of Anduin and those of the\nsouth acknowledged its authority and did homage to it. Mordor was well\nwatched and the fortresses built to watch over it were well-manned and\nmaintained and it remained desolate and unpeopled.

During this time, the\nElves became a diversified people forming into many different groups and\ncultures. The Elves that settled in Aman became High Elves and their\nprinces kings. Written language systems were developed using the Sarati\nand the Tengwar.\n\nIn Middle-earth, the Elves developed into the Sindar and were ruled by\nElwë and his Queen, the Maia Melian, in Doriath. The lost group of Elves\nwho followed Lenwë during the Great Journey reappeared in Beleriand\ncalling themselves the Nandor, and settled in Ossiriand.\n\nThe Chaining lasted three ages, or a total of about three thousand\nyears. The era ended with the release of Melkor who slowly poisoned the\npeace and stirred up rivalries and dissent among the Noldor. Thus, the\nNoontide of Valinor came to an end, the Darkness of Valinor began, and\nmany Noldorin houses rebelled against the Valar and went to war with\nMelkor, who was now known as Morgoth, in Middle-earth.\n"

Their language appears\nto be based on an ancient form of Common Eldarin, later enriched by\nQuenya and Sindarin, although it includes many unique 'tree-ish'\nadditions.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOld Entish\n\nOriginally, the Ents had a language of their own, described as long and\nsonorous. Only Ents spoke Old Entish; not because they kept their\nlanguage a secret, as the Dwarves did with Khuzdul, but because no other\ncould master it. It was quite an alien language to all others. The\nHuorns and trees of Fangorn forest could understand Old Entish and\nconverse with the Ents and each other with it. The only extant sample,\na-lalla-lalla-rumba-kamanda-lindor-burúme, the word for hill (or\npossibly even just part of the name of a specific hill), was described\nas a very inaccurate sampling. Even the Elves, master linguists, could\nnot learn Old Entish, nor did they attempt to record it due to its\ncomplex sound structure. The grammar structure of Old Entish was also\nquite bizarre, often described as a lengthy, long-winded discussion of a\ntopic. There may not even have been a word for yes and no: such\nquestions would be answered by a long monologue on why the Ent in\nquestion did or did not agree with the Ent who asked the question. Ents\nas a rule would say nothing in Old Entish unless it was worth taking a\nlong time to say. For everyday language function, they usually resorted\nto “New” Entish.\n\nNew Entish\n\nDue to contact with the Elves, the Ents learned much from them. The Ents\nfound the Elvish language Quenya to be a lovely language, and adapted it\nafter their fashion to everyday use. However, they basically adapted\nQuenya vocabulary to Old Entish grammatical structure. Thus, unlike Old\nEntish, the individual words of “New Entish” that characters such as\nTreebeard spoke were easily translatable.\n\n\nWords and Translations\n\nMost of the Entish words and vowels are almost entirely based on Quenya\nand Sindarin, the two most common languages spoken by the Elves.\n\nde:Entisch ru:Язык энтов"

Cardolan did not oppose this as there the Dúnedain had grown few,\nbut the kingdom of Rhudaur resisted the claim by Argeleb, led by an evil\nhill-chief who was in secret league with Angmar. At this, Argeleb\ndecided to fortify the Weather Hills to resist an invasion from the east\nby the forces of Angmar and Rhudaur, but he was slain in battle in the\nyear TA 1356 along the frontier.\n\n\nPrelude\n\nIn 1409 the Witch-King of Angmar led a great host across the river\nHoarwell against land of Cardolan, after being beaten back out of the\nlands of the Dúnedain many years before.\n\nThe son of Argeleb, King Arveleg I continued his fathers defence against\nAngmar along the fortified Weather Hills, the Great East Road, and the\nlower Hoarwell, and for many years he held back the assaults of Angmar\nand Rhudaur. It was also at this time that the Elven haven of Rivendell\nwas besieged by the forces of Angmar. Arnor's capital of Fornost lay\nupon the North Downs only a few dozen miles away from the Weather Hills,\nand Angmar sought a way to break through the frontier and lay siege to\nthe city. It was to this end that in the year TA 1409 a great host came\nout of Angmar, and crossing the river it entered Cardolan and surrounded\nAmon Sûl. After a fierce siege the Dúnedain of Arnor were defeated, the\ntower of Amon Sûl destroyed, and King Arveleg slain. However, the\nWitch-king's victory was not complete, as the palantír of Amon Sûl, the\ngreatest of the three in the north, was carried back in retreat to\nFornost.\n\nAfter the destruction of Amon Sûl, the power of Arnor to resist the army\nof Angmar was severely weakened. The tower's destruction meant that the\narmy of Angmar had now made the fortified line along the Weather Hills\nuntenable, and its forces gained easy access to the heart of Arnor.\nRhudaur was now absorbed by Angmar and populated by evil men subject to\nthe Witch-King. The few Dúnedain who remained were either slain or fled\nfar westwards, never returning to the lands now claimed by Angmar. The\nkingdom of Cardolan was ravaged by the forces of Angmar who entered its\nnorthern borders uncontested by the crippled army of Arthedain, and its\npeople fled into hiding on the ancient Barrow Downs, or Tyrn Gorthad in\nSindarin. It was in this desperate defence against Angmar that the last\nprince of Cardolan fell in battle, and he was entombed by the survivors\namong his people in what some say was the very same barrow that Frodo\nand his companions had been imprisoned during the War of the Ring.\n\nAlthough the situation was dire, the young King Araphor, son of Arveleg,\ndefended the city of Fornost against the host of Angmar. Although he was\nstill a youth by the reckoning of his people, Araphor proved valiant,\nand with the help of Círdan of Lindon he repulsed Angmar's army from the\nNorth Downs and won a great victory. It was at this time that Angmar was\nsubdued by Elven-folk from Lindon, Rivendell, and even Lothlórien for\nElrond had brought help over the passes of the Misty Mountains. At the\nsame time, the Stoors (one of the three peoples who were named Hobbits)\nwho had previously dwelt in the angle between the Hoarwell and the\nLoudwater fled south-westwards because of the wars and the dread of\nAngmar, and because the land and clime of eastern Eriador worsened and\nbecame unfriendly. Some of these returned to Wilderland in Rhovanion and\ndwelt alongside the banks of the Gladden, becoming a riverside people of\nfishers, but others migrated westwards to a land known by the Dúnedain\nas Sûza, which the Stoors named the Shire. These peoples were granted by\nthe eleventh king of Arthedain, Argeleb II, land that had become\nsparsely populated by war, and dwelling there as a people became the\nHobbits known by the end of the Third Age for their love of peace and\ndomesticity.\n\n\nAftermath\n\nAmon Sûl was the main defensive outpost in the Weather Hills and\nnorthern Cardolan. With it gone the Witch-King was able to take and\nravage Cardolan, as well as consolidate his new conquests in Rhudaur,\nwhich his Hill-Men allies and subjects had taken, as well as launch\nattacks against the whole of Arthedain.\n\nHowever despite permanently ending the threat that was Cardolan, Angmar\nwas unable to ride its momentum, and was driven away from the city of\nFornost and the North Downs by the forces of the new King Araphor and\nLord Círdan of Lindon.\n"

    "text": "The CORSAIR WARS were a long, predominately naval struggle between Kings\nand Stewards of Gondor and a series of renegade rebel forces based at\nUmbar and Pelargir.\n\n\nHistorical Background\n\nThe fortress haven of Umbar was founded by Númenórean colonists during\nthe Second Age, during the peak of Númenorean power. When Ar-Pharazôn\nthe Golden landed in Middle Earth to challenge the power of Sauron, he\nlanded at this heavily fortified port city. After the Downfall of\nNúmenor, these colonists continued to be influenced by Sauron, and\nshowed great antipathy to the exile Kingdoms founded by the Faithful of\nNúmenor, Arnor and Gondor. They became known forever afterward as the\nBlack Númenoreans, battling Gondor by land and sea. It is likely that\nUmbar was conquered for Gondor under one of the Ship-Kings, possibly by\nTarannon Falastur. During the reign of Earnil I and his son, Ciryandil,\nthe Haradrim constantly laid siege to Umbar and in T.A. 1015, Ciryandil\nhimself was slain defending it. This caused his son to conquer Harad and\neventually take the name, Hyarmendacil I.\n\n\nEarly Years\n\nIn the aftermath of the Kin-strife, the great civil conflict between\nEldacar and the usurper Castamir, Castamir's sons fled to to Umbar.\nThere they established a breakaway government in opposition to Gondor,\nand continued to clash with Gondor for centuries to come.\n\n\nPelargir Battles\n\nIn T.A. 1551, Hyarmendacil II conquered Harad when his father, Aldamir,\nwas slain in a skirmish with the Corsairs. However, Umbar held out\nagainst Hyarmendacil's attacks, but suffered grievously.\n\nIn T.A. 1634 the Corsairs learnt that King Minardil, son of\nHyarmendacil, was holidaying in the port city of Pelargir.\n\nLater the Corsairs staged a surprise attack, and Minardil was slain\nbefore he could organise a proper defence of the port. The Corsairs then\nmade a sudden withdrawal.\n\nUnfortunately for Gondor, Pelagir remained a prime target for the\nCorsairs throughout the rest of the Third Age, and by the time of the\nWar of the Ring, the city was a shadow of its former glory.\n\n\nThe Siege of Umbar\n\nThis may refer to several different events in history, when Umbar\nconstantly changed hands between Gondor, and the Corsairs with their\nHaradrim allies.\n\nThe first time Umbar was involved with the wars between Gondor and Harad\nwas when one of the Ship-Kings conquered it from the Haradrim and Black\nNumenoreans who resided there. At this point, Harondor was still under\nGondorian control so it can be assumed that perhaps Umbar was connected\nby land to Gondor, and not just a port outpost surrounded by enemies.\n\nThe wars with Harad never ceased and in T.A. 1015 the Haradrim staged an\nassault on Umbar and King Ciryandil was slain defendings its walls.\nAlthough the port was not taken, it effected the Gondorian populace and\nabove all else, Ciryaher, Ciryandil's son. 35 years later, King Ciryaher\nnot only lifted the Siege of Umbar, but conquered a huge portion of Near\nHarad, crushing the power of the Haradrim.\n\nFor the next four hundred years, Umbar was to remain in Gondorian\ncontrol until after the Kin Strife, when the Sons of Castimir fled\nPelagir and seized Umbar for their own. This proved to be the start of\nGondor's rapid decline.\n\nAldamir, son of Eldacar, still holding a grudge against Castimir and his\nsons for the murder of his brother in the burning of Osgiliath,\nassaulted Umbar and was slain in the process, but the Corsairs victory\nwas soon avenged when Vinyarion, Aldamir's son, conquered Harad and laid\nsiege to Umbar.\n\nBut Gondor's temporary territorial claims in the south were soon\nreversed when the Gondorian siege of Umbar was lifted and the Corsairs\nraided Pelagir, killing King Minardil in the process.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Plague, both sides were temporarily\nweakened, but Telumehtar of Gondor struck first and conquered Umbar for\nGondor, the last descendants of Castimir perished in the process.\n\nIt is never stated when the Corsairs reconquered Umbar, but it is likely\nthat it fell back to the Corsairs sometime during the reigns of the next\nfew Kings, when Gondor itself was nearly toppled by Wainriders."

    "text": "The DUEL IN DOL GULDUR is a battle that took place in Dol Guldur between\nSauron and Gandalf. After investigating the tombs of the Nazgûl in the\nHigh Fells of Rhudaur, Gandalf entered the old fortress of Dol Guldur\nand bring forth the evil. That was when he was ambushed by strange\nfigure who was revealed to be Thrain, son of Thrór and father of Thorin\nOakenshield. Gandalf saved him bu removing the insanity and planned to\nget him out of the fortress. However, their efforts came to late when\nthey were ambushed by Azog and group of Guldur Orcs that prevented them\nfrom escaping. Gandalf and Thrain managed to elude them, but they both\nencountered the Sauron, who killed Thrain and managed to beat Gandalf.\nAfter subduing the wizard, Sauron revealed himself, much to Gandalf's\nhorror.\n\n\nBiography\n\nPrelude\n\n In TA 2941, Gandalf was forced to abandon Company of\nThorin Oakenshield near the borders of Mirkwood and travel to the High\nFells of Rhudaur, the eastern part of Arnor. After leaving the Company,\nGandalf reaches the High Fells, revealed to be a chamber built\nprecariously into the side the a mountain and barred by an iron gate,\nwhich has been ripped open violently. As Gandalf steps inside, he slips\nand begins sliding down a slanted chute leading to a bottomless chasm,\nnearly falling to his death but managing to land on a narrow staircase\nbuilt into the wall at the base of the chute just in time. It is\nimmediately revealed that High Fells was neither meant to be found nor\nleft once entered, but Gandalf continues his descent down into the\ndarkness nonetheless. He managed to reach one of the a chamber built\ninto the wall whose iron gate has also been crudely smashed, where it is\nrevealed to hold a tomb whose massive stone lid broken has been broken\nin two from the inside and now lies empty.\n\nWhile trying to solve this alone, Gandalf was startled by the sudden\nappearance of Radagast, who questions why they have chosen to meet in\nthe High Fells. There, Gandalf went on to reveal much of the tombs and\nthat the chamber had been designed to hold a being whose name has long\nbeen forgotten, and would be known only as a “servant of evil.” Gandalf\nthen shines his staff down the chasm to reveal the presence of eight\nsimilar chambers, all similarly broken out of by their captors,\nindicating that the chamber is the prison of the Nazgûl, the nine\nservants of the Dark Lord Sauron. As they left the Fells, Gandalf and\nRadagast discuss the Nazgûl's reawakening, and Gandalf asserts that they\nhave been summoned to Don Goldur by the Necromancer. When Radagast\nasserts that no human sorcerer could possess such powerful dark magic,\nGandalf relays his growing suspicion that the Necromancer is actually\nSauron in disguise, but was still too weak to assume his true form, as\nthe Nazgûl only answer to their one true master. When Gandalf decided to\nreturn to the dwarven company and meet them at the slopes of Erebor,\nRadagast insists that they must investigate Dol Guldur at once. Gandalf\ncounters that the dwarves are in great danger without him, but Radagast\nreminds him that if Sauron has indeed returned, the entire world would\nsoon be in great danger.\n\nEncounter with Thrain\n\nReluctantly convinced by Radagast's words, the two wizards arrive near\nthe entrance of Dol Guldur. Radagast seems uncertain that the fortress\nis occupied, but Gandalf immediately recognises that a spell of\nconcealment lies on the Hill of Sorcery. Before entering the fortress\nhimself, Gandalf ordered Radagast to warn Galadriel of their discovery.\nRadagast warned him that it could be a trap, but Gandalf denied and\nenters the fortress at once. Upon entering, Gandalf began to chant\nspells in Quenya to bring forth all hidden evil and remove the shroud of\nconcealment. While Azog and his army remained hidden, Gandalf continued\nto investigate deep in the abandoned fortress, but that was not until he\nencountered a strange diminished figure who had been following the\nwizard. The figure was known to be an insane dwarf and jumped down onto\nGandalf and attacked him under his madness. The two engage in battle\nuntil the wizard managed to to restrain him and used his power to bring\nback his senses.\n\nAfter Gandalf healed the dwarf from his madness that infected him, he\nwas so surprised and relieved that the dwarf was revealed to be Thráin,\nson of Thrór. Thráin began to remember what had happened to him and\nrealized that he was in Dol Guldur for a long time. Before leaving the\nold fortress, Thráin wanted to know if the map and key (that he gave to\nGandalf) were kept safe, but when the wizard told him that he gave the\nitems to Thorin who was embarked on the Quest of Erebor, Thráin was\nshocked by this and told Gandalf that his son, nor anyone, must never\nenter the mountain due to the sickness that lied upon the treasure.\nGandalf also discovers that the last of the Seven Dwarf Rings is\nmissing, and Thrain remembers how he lost it to Azog when he brutally\ncut off his ring finger.\n\nDuel in the Fortress\n\nAt around nightfall, Thráin helped Gandalf navigate through the fortress\nand continued to explain to him that Smaug and The One were in league\nwith each other until Azog himself launched a surprise attack and was\nable to stun Gandalf and scatter his staff and sword. Gandalf however\nwas able to reclaim his staff and easily repelled Azog with a\ntelekinetic force, enraging the pale orc. Gandalf keeps Azog and his\norcs at bay with his staff and demands to know where Sauron is, to which\nAzog replies “he is everywhere”. Gravely outnumbered, Gandalf used a\nflash spell for him and Thráin to flee from the orcs; he either\nteleported or simply ran away afterwards. Gandalf and Thráin make their\nescape, but are soon pursued by a group of Warg-riders. Gandalf uses his\nstaff to strike a wall; the resulting blast crumbles an entire tower\nthat crashes down on the Warg Riders and breaks the bridge. As they soon\nreached the entrance, Gandalf and Thráin found a cloud of darkness\nbarring their way out. It was the Necromancer, who warned “there is no\nlight which can defeat the darkness”. Seeing no way out, Thráin told\nGandalf to tell Thorin that he loved him, to which Gandalf replied he\ncould tell Thorin himself once they got out of there. Despite Gandalf's\nattempts to protect him, Thráin was sucked into the black mist and\nconsumed by the Necromancer.  After Thráin's death, Gandalf and the Necromancer engage\nin a battle of light and dark as the Necromancer launches a barrage of\nshadow energy at Gandalf, who repels it with a force field of light\npowered by his staff which makes his crystal grow with great light in a\nsmall radius. The Necromancer repeatedly launches himself at Gandalf's\nmassive spherical light shield, while Gandalf struggles to maintain it.\nSauron forces the shield to dissipate, but Gandalf conjures it again to\nhold off the dark energy. When Gandalf manages to push the energy\nfurther away from him, it stacks up and breaks through the shield a\nsecond time. Exhausted, Gandalf holds up his staff as a physical shield\nagainst his foe. The Necromancer then approaches him in a flaming\nspectral form, and the flames disintegrate Gandalf's staff. The smoke\nand flames telekinetically pin him against a wall, most of which\ncollapses from the surging energy. At this point the Necromancer can be\nseen as a figure with a horned helmet, in an aura of fire resembling a\ngreat eye. Gandalf's worst suspicions are confirmed as the Necromancer\nreveals himself to indeed be Sauron. Gandalf is later imprisoned in a\ncage and watches in horror as Azog's army of Guldur Orcs march towards\nthe Lonely Mountain."

Tolkien decided that his peoples of Arda would also use a similar\nscript, and “Runes” are mentioned in his narratives.\n\nIn _The Hobbit_, Tolkien used Old English runes, or Futharc, to display\nthe writing of the Dwarves on the Thrór's Map; his Dwarves however were\nbased mainly on Norse culture and their language is influenced of\nSemitic languages. The texts of course are modern English, and\ndisplay the use of Westron of the Third Age.\n\nThe foreword of _The Hobbit_ (50th anniversary edition and later)\nexplains the usage of the Old English runes and help the reader read the\nMap (although the translations are also revealed in the end of Chapter\n3, _A Short Rest_)\n\nEventually Tolkien elaborated on a totally original runic writing system\nwhile writing _The Lord of the Rings_. Although most of the letters\nbetween historical runes and Tolkien's “cirth” are identical, they do\nnot share the same values, since the Cirth follow the phonetic\nprinciples of the Tengwar.\n\nIn the history of Arda, a runic script called Cirth was invented\nby Daeron of Doriath to represent Sindarin words. Runes came to be used\nwidely by races other than the Elves, and especially by the Dwarves."
