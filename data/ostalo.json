    "text": "These Were giant armored war beasts (most likely Mountain Trolls) that\nparticipated in the Battle of the Five Armies, in The Hobbit: The Battle\nof the Five Armies.\n\n\nStatistics\n\nThese trolls were very large, dwarfing all the others seen previously,\n(about 25 feet tall or more) more importantly they were either fully or\npartially armored, unlike the smaller yet extremely similar Guldur\nOlog-Hai, which were fully armored but as stated above much smaller\n(about the size of a regular troll in the films) These trolls were\nfearsome weapons on the field and devastated dozens of soldiers with one\nstrike alone of their weapons.\n\nThese trolls were quite intelligent and kept formation with the orcs as\nthey marched to battle, in battle these trolls carried bladed axe/sword\nlike weapons upon their arms, (similar to the Guldur Orcs's shields)\nlong metal maces which could smash the very earth several feet into the\nair, taking down several men at once. Some even used their bare hands,\nballing them up into fists to smash the allied armies, or sweeping them\nup and throwing them like rag-dolls.\n\nThe less fortunate of these trolls were also hideously amputated by the\norcs, giving them morning star (wrecking ball-like) arms in place of\ntheir flesh and blood ones, some had metal hooks placed into their backs\nfor goblins to take hold of, and the most unfortunate was blinded and\ngiven reigns dangling from their eye sockets for orcs to directly take\ncontrol of.\n\nThese trolls were probably Mountain Trolls from Gundabad in the northern\nmisty mountains, this would explain their height, and color of their\nskin (being a peach like hue) instead of the darker blue cave troll skin\nor dark grey olog-hai skin.\n\nUnlike the smaller Guldur Olog's these trolls couldn't simply be taken\ndown by a spear throw to the neck or a few arrows. It would take dozens\nof arrows and several spears/pikes to be sent into the unarmored parts\nof the trolls in order to take them down. A premeditated attack upon a\ntroll would usually work and need to be planned out well in order to\ntake out the beast before it took down a whole garrison.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThese trolls were used primarily in Azog the Defiler's Dol-Guldur orc\narmy, directed to come out as soon as Azog called for the war beasts,\nalmost immediately these trolls smashed into the allied army, causing\nmassive damage, when some of the orc regiments made their way to the\nruins of dale, some of these trolls joined them, climbing over the walls\nor simply smashing them down to gain access. One of these trolls was\neven given a stone headpiece to act as a battering ram to the walls of\ndale. Most of these trolls survived until the end of the battle, still\nfighting on when the bats of gundabad arrived. But once the Eagles\narrived, the remaining trolls either fled into the Were -Worm tunnels,\nor were eventually taken down by the combined allied forces."

    "title": "The Fellowship of the Ring (group)",
    "page_id": "23",
    "text": "The FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING was formed as a brotherhood among members of\nthe various Free Peoples of Middle-earth. Its purpose was to take the\nOne Ring to Mordor that it might be cast into the fires of Mount Doom,\nthe mountain in which it was forged, so that it would be destroyed and\nultimately kill the Dark Lord Sauron.\n\nThe '''Fellowship '''was also known as the COMPANY OF THE RING, the NINE\nWALKERS, or more simply the COMPANY. Each of the members of the Company\nwere representatives of their respective races, with Legolas and Gimli\nbeing the only Elf and Dwarf chosen.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFormation\n\nFormed after the Council of Elrond, the Fellowship consisted of nine\nmembers: four Hobbits, two Men, one Elf, one Dwarf, and one Wizard. It\nis the only known organisation/group ever formed in the history of\nMiddle-earth, to hold members of each of these races within it (and with\nthe departure of the Elves and the Wizards from Middle-earth, there\nwould never be another like it), who largely lived and acted\nindependently of one another (or in the case of Elves and Dwarves, felt\nactive animosity toward each other). This number was chosen to match the\nnumber of Ring Wraiths, also known as Black Riders, the Nazgúl or the\nNine Riders. Merry and Pippin were never intended to be a part of the\nFellowship, with Elrond considering two Elf-lords from his own house. He\nwished to send the two younger hobbits back to the Shire as messengers\nto warn other Hobbits of the growing evil. However, the Halflings\npersevere: Merry is chosen and Gandalf convinces Elrond of the loyalty\nof Pippin.\n\n\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring was formed by Elrond after the Council of\nElrond. The Fellowship, being led mainly by Gandalf, headed down the\npath to Mordor.\n\nAfter a long and difficult journey south from Rivendell, and a\nnear-catastrophic attempt to cross over the Misty Mountains, the\nFellowship descended into Moria. In the former Dwarf-kingdom, they found\nevidence that Orcs had slain Gimli's kinsman Balin and other Dwarves who\nhad returned there. They were soon confronted by the Balrog known as\n_Durin's Bane_, who had many Orc and Troll minions under his control.\nGandalf fell facing this menace, and the Company was forced to go on\nwithout him.\n\nOnce they escaped Moria, the Fellowship headed to the Elven forest of\nLothlórien where they spoke with the Elven Lord Celeborn and Galadriel,\nLady of Light. Galadriel supplied them each with special Elven Gifts\nfrom Lothlórien, boats and supplies so that they could travel down the\nriver Anduin. This route was quicker than an overland march, but the\ngroup was attacked by Orc archers and shadowed by Gollum, who had begun\nfollowing them in Moria.\n\nForced to portage their boats around the waterfall called Rauros, the\nFellowship soon ran into difficulties. Boromir finally succumbed to\ntemptation, and attempted to seize the Ring from Frodo. This led to\nFrodo using the Ring to escape and he and Sam leaving to spare the\nothers the lure of it. The repentant Boromir died trying to defend Merry\nand Pippin against a large force of Uruks from Isengard.\n\nThe Fellowship was dissolved on the banks of the Anduin that day. Frodo\nand Sam carried on towards Mordor; Boromir was given funerary rites and\nsent floating over the falls, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli departed on\ntheir way to save Merry and Pippin.\n\nBreaking of the Fellowship\n\nAfter Boromir died the Fellowship split into three paths. From there\nAragorn, Legolas and Gimli chased after the Uruk-hai who took Merry and\nPippin. Their plan was to take the hobbits to Saruman in Isengard. Along\nthe way the trio crossed through the Gap of Rohan and came across Éomer\nwho led the banished Riders of Rohan across the land. After questioning\nÉomer, they found out that the riders had already slain the Uruk-hai\nthey were meant to track, the night before in a bloody massacre. So upon\narriving to site of battle, Aragorn discovers that the hobbits fled deep\ninto Fangorn Forest.\n\nGandalf, though thought to be dead when he fell at the Bridge of Khazad\nDum in Moria, came back to Middle-earth, reincarnated as Gandalf the\nWhite. He encountered Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in Fangorn, and they,\nmistaking Gandalf for Saruman, attempted to kill him. Gandalf assured\nthem that Merry and Pippin were safe (knowing they were in the hands of\nTreebeard). From there they rode out to Edoras, capital of Rohan. It was\nthere they saw King Theoden in ill-condition, poisoned by Saruman's\nservant Grima Wormtongue.\n\nFrodo and Sam continued their journey, getting closer to Mordor. Gollum\nhad tailed them. While attempting to take “the precious” in their sleep,\nFrodo and Sam awoke and captured him. Frodo realizing who he was decided\nGollum could be used as guide into Mordor.\n\nThe Second Fellowship\n\nIn the book, Aragorn continues to call the company he leads (Legolas and\nGimli, occasionally joined by Gandalf, Merry, and Pippin) the Fellowship\nof the Ring even after the original Fellowship breaks up following\nBoromir's death. The fellowship is reunited again after the War of The\nRing up until Rohan, where the fellowship ends.\n\n  Name      Age\n  --------- ----------------------\n  Frodo     50\n  Samwise   38\n  Merry     36\n  Pippin    28\n  Aragorn   87\n  Boromir   40\n  Legolas   2000+\n  Gimli     139\n  Gandalf   2000+ (Middle-Earth)\n\n  : AGES OF THE MEMBERS (TA 3018)\n\n\nMembers",

However, in SA 3319 (Second Age), Sauron deceived Ar-Pharazôn,\nthe King of Númenor, that the ruler of the Undying Lands would be\ngranted immortality. To prevent the king's invasion, Ilúvatar destroyed\nNúmenor beneath the ocean and set the Undying Lands forever beyond the\nreach of mortal Men.

    "text": "ARNOR, also known as the NORTHERN KINGDOM, was a kingdom of men located\nin the land of Eriador in Middle-earth. The name probably means “Land of\nthe King”, from Sindarin ARA- (high, kingly) + (N)DOR (land).\n\n\nHistory\n\nArnor was founded in SA 3320 by Elendil and sons who went on to found\nthe southern realm of Gondor. The history of the two kingdoms is\nintertwined; both kingdoms are known as the Realms of the Dúnedain in\nExile.\n\nBefore the foundation of Arnor there was already a sizable Númenórean\npopulation living there, a result of the slow emigration of Númenóreans\nwhich had started under Tar-Meneldur and Tar-Aldarion. Before the\narrival of the Dúnedain, Arnor was home to Middle Men of Edain stock,\nand the early colonists soon interbred with the indigenous population.\nArnor was originally favoured over the more southern regions (Gondor)\nbecause the Elves under Gil-galad lived near it across the river Lhûn.\nHowever, in later days after the Númenóreans fell under Sauron's shadow\nthey settled more to the south. This led to a situation where Elendil\narrived in an area populated by people who, unlike his own Númenóreans,\nwere mainly still friends with the Elves, and unlike Gondor to the south\nin Arnor much knowledge of the Elder Days was preserved.\n\nArnor's second king Isildur (also King of Gondor) was killed in TA 2 by\norcs in the disastrous Battle of the Gladden Fields. His three eldest\nsons were killed with him, but the fourth and youngest, Valandil,\nsurvived and became king of Arnor (TA 2 or 10?).\n\n\n\nBecause Valandil and his heirs did not claim the throne of Gondor the\nrealms were split, but Arnor's ruler kept the title High King, whereas\nin the south the ruler was just _King._ At its height, Arnor borders\nextended from the Ice-Bay of Forochel in the north, the river Greyflood\ndown to Belegaer in the south, the river Hoarwell in the east, and the\nriver Lune in the west. The capital city was Annúminas, and the realm\nincluded other cities such as Fornost, Tharbad, Lond Daer, and Tyrn\nGorthad.\n\nDecline\n\nHuman folly and the plots of a deathless evil had undone this dream.\nArnor was no more; divided into the three kingdoms of Arthedain,\nCardolan and Rhudaur, the Dúnedain of the North spent their strength in\nfoolish, petty wars and while corruption and ambition sapped their\nstrength, enemies gathered on their frontiers. Arnor's capital was\nAnnúminas on Lake Evendim, but by TA 861 Fornost Erain had become the\ncapital instead as Annúminas became depopulated.\n\nAfter the death of its tenth king, Eärendur, in 861, Arnor was shaken by\ncivil war between the three sons of Eärendur. The eldest son, Amlaith,\nclaimed Kingship over all Arnor but was reduced to only ruling the\nregion of Arthedain as his kingdom, while the other sons founded the\nkingdoms of Cardolan and Rhudaur.\n\nArnor was refounded in name by Arthedain's king Argeleb I, when Cardolan\nplaced itself under the suzerainty of Arthedain. However, even Arthedain\nwas eventually destroyed. The people of Arnor were mostly wiped out by\nthe wars, but the Hobbits survived in the Shire, men survived in Bree\nand probably other villages, and the Dúnedain of Arnor created new homes\nin the Angle south of Rivendell, where some of them became known as the\nRangers of the North.\n\nReunited Kingdom\n\nAragorn II as King Elessar refounded the Kingdom of Arnor as part of the\nReunited Kingdom, and made Annúminas his summer capital. After the fall\nof Sauron, Arnor was safe again for human population, and although it\nremained less populated than Gondor to the south, in time Arnor became a\nmore densely populated area again, even when it had dwindled in size due\nto the independence of the Shire.",

    "text": "The FIRST AGE began with the completion of Valinor, and ended with the\noverthrow of Morgoth. The First Age was also known as the ELDER DAYS.\n\nIt lasted about 3,000 Valian years, and each Valian year is the\nequivalent of 10 solar years.(making it the longest of the three Ages\ndescribed by Tolkien), and ended with the final overthrow of Morgoth by\nthe combined armies of Valinor and Beleriand.\n\n\n\nTolkien describes primarily the events that occurred in Beleriand. These\nwere centered on a series of wars waged by the Sindar, the Ñoldor and\nthe Three Houses of the Edain, against the power of Morgoth. The wars\nhad actually begun during the Years of the Trees, but began again with\nrenewed fury after the arrival of the Ñoldor in Beleriand. There had\nbeen Elves in Beleriand for uncounted millennia, but they sought merely\nto exist, and Morgoth had little to do with them. The Ñoldor, on the\nother hand, particularly the Sons of Fëanor, had come with the express\npurpose of defeating Morgoth.\n\nChief Battles of this Age\n\n-   The Dagor-nuin-Giliath, so named because it was fought before the\n    rising of the Sun) was fought soon after the arrival of the Ñoldor.\n    Morgoth sent a raiding party from Angband to attack the Ñoldor\n    encampment in Hithlum, but the elves drove it back. Fëanor was\n    killed. It is considered the second battle in the Wars of Beleriand,\n    after one that took place during the Years of the Trees.\n\n\n\n-   The Dagor Aglareb was fought about seventy-five years after the\n    return of the Ñoldor. Morgoth again attacked the Ñoldor, and (again)\n    with no success. The Ñoldor became so bold as to besiege Angband.\n    However, the Siege was of limited effectiveness, because the\n    northern side of Angband on the north side of the Ered Engrin, and\n    was unapproachable to the Elven forces.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The Dagor Bragollach began when Morgoth poured rivers of fire out of\n    Angband, ruining the besieging Ñoldorin armies. The Ñoldor\n    eventually mustered a defense, but their losses were severe. For\n    instance, the green plain of Ard-galen had been permanently laid\n    waste by the rivers of fire, and was now called _Anfauglith_, the\n    Choking Dust; and the highlands of Dorthonion, which had been\n    inhabited by Edain, were made inhospitable.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The Nirnaeth Arnoediad was the first battle to be started by the\n    Ñoldor for the purpose of ending the power of Morgoth. They massed\n    an army composed of Elves, Edain, and the Easterling houses of Bór\n    and Ulfang allied to the Sons of Fëanor. The Elves and their allies\n    came very close to Angband, but Morgoth's trickery had upset their\n    battle plan, and Ulfang proved to be treacherous. The name\n    “Unnumbered Tears” comes from the fact that the Elves' last hope of\n    victory was destroyed. The land of Hithlum was lost, the Sons of\n    Fëanor were largely scattered, and the free peoples of Beleriand had\n    been decimated. The forces of Morgoth made a heap of the Elven and\n    Mannish dead in the center of Anfauglith.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The War of Wrath took place after Eärendil sailed to Valinor and\n    persuaded the Valar to help those whom they had forsaken. The Valar\n    gathered an army comprised of Maiar, Vanyar, and those Ñoldor who\n    had stayed in Valinor. The Teleri refused their aid, due to the\n    Kinslaying at Alqualondë, but consented to ferry the armies of the\n    Valar in their famous ships. This battle marked the first appearance\n    of the winged dragons, most notably Ancalagon the Black, but the\n    Valar had the day. Morgoth was captured, and cast out of Arda, but\n    his lands, as well as most of Beleriand, had been destroyed and sunk\n    under the sea in the heat of battle."

They\n    were also called the FAITHFUL for their continued devotion and\n    obedience to the Valar. Their most noted leader was Elendil, Lord of\n    Andúnië, who later founded the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor in\n    Middle-earth.\n\nBy the close of the Second Age Númenóreans had become split between the\nElendili and the King's Men — a faction centered around the King that\nsought to assert Númenórean authority and self-determination. With\nNúmenor reaching the apex of its might, the King's Men eventually\nespoused open defiance of the Valar. This split would eventually\nprecipitate the Fall of Númenor.\n\nThe Elendili, however, not only preserved their ancient friendship with\nthe Elves, they also regarded the burgeoning arrogance of the King's Men\nas blasphemy. But the King's Men became more powerful, and by the end of\nthe Second Age had begun to persecute the Elendili as rebels and\ndissidents. Fearing their growing strength, the King's men secured the\nFaithful's deportation from their strongholds in the western regions,\nnotably around the city Andúnië.\n\nThe Elendili enjoyed a brief respite when Elf-friend Tar-Palantir\nassumed kingship and began to turn Númenor back to the ways of the\nFaithful. But after Tar-Panatir died, his nephew Ar-Pharazôn usurped the\nthrone and the Elendili were more vigorously oppressed, this time with\nthe help of the Dark Lord Sauron, who had established an evil cult on\nthe island to corrupt and eventually destroy Númenórean society.\n\nAs Ar-Pharazôn led his grand armada to Aman to challenge the Ban of the\nValar, Elendil and the remaining Elf-friends were warned by the divine\npowers to leave Númenor forever. They were thus spared the downfall of\nNúmenor when, as punishment for an attempt to defy the Ban, Ilúvatar\nsank the island kingdom into the sea.\n\nThe Elendili, under the leadership of Elendil and his sons, eventually\nmade their way to refuge in Middle-Earth where they were welcomed by the\nElves.

Also living in the Halls\nof Mandos was his spouse Vairë the weaver, who wove the threads of time.\n\nTo the east of the Halls of Mandos was the Isle of Estë, which was\nsituated in the middle of the lake of Lorellin which in turn was\nsituated to the north of the Gardens of Lórien (not to be confused with\nLothlórien in Middle-earth which was created by the same Valar, Lórien\nalso known as Irmo, the Vala of dreams). Este and Lórien being husband\nand wife lived close together. To the north of this were the Mansions of\nAule the smith Valar who was spouse to Yavanna. In the north-east lay\nthe Mansions of Manwe and Varda, the two most powerful Valar, also\nmarried. To the west of them stood the Trees of Valinor, Telperion and\nLaurelin. The entire great island of Valinor was surrounded on three\nsides (excluding the north which was instead protected by ices flows) by\na huge mountain range called the Pelóri mountains. In the extreme\nnorth-east, past the mountain range was the pass of Helcaraxë, a vast\nand treacherous ice sheet which in the beginning, before the fall of\nNúmenor, joined the two continents of Valinor and Middle-earth. In the\nbeginning, the Noldor, tricked by the evil Vala Melkor passed along this\npass to go back to Middle-earth, among those was Galadriel who was\nfeatured in the War of the Ring. Those who took this pass were not\nallowed back to Valinor for many years, but in the end pity was taken on\nthem when Middle-earth began to fade and pass into the age of men and\nthey were allowed to pass back to the Undying Lands of their own accord\nwhen they felt ready to do so.\n\nAlso, for a time after the exile of the Noldor and before the ruin of\nNúmenor, a long chain of small islands called the Enchanted Isles ran\nthe full length of the east coast to the continent. The enchanted\nislands and a bewildering shadow created the Shadowy Seas, which to\nprevent mariner, mortal or immortal, from reaching the land by sea (by\nthe Belegaer, the Great Sea which separated Middle-earth and Valinor.\nUntil the Changing of the World in the center of this sea was the isle\nof Númenor. This defence lasted centuries until Eärendil was guided\nthrough the Shadowy Seas by the light of the Silmaril brought on board\nby his wife Elwing. They sailed on Vingilot, said to be the fairest ship\never fashioned, constructed by Earendil and Cirdan the shipwright.\n\nAfter the destruction of Númenor and the Changing of the World, the\nUndying Lands were no longer a physical part of Arda so that Men could\nno longer sail to Aman or Tol Eressea. Only the Elves could sail there\nby the Straight Road and in ships capable of passing out of the Spheres\nof the earth.\n\nBy special permission of the Valar, the Hobbits Frodo Baggins, Bilbo\nBaggins, and Samwise Gamgee were also permitted to go to Valinor, and\nLegolas the elf brought with him Gimli the Dwarf.\n"

    "text": "The FOURTH AGE was the time period that followed the War of the Ring. It\nwas an age of peace, and was also known as the “Age of Men”.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Fourth Age began after Sauron was vanquished and the One Ring was\ndestroyed. The Shire and the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor were restored.\nIt marked the ascent of Men and the final diminishing of the Elves.\nGandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Bilbo and Frodo sailed for the Undying\nLands.\n\nThe allies of Sauron suffered a devastating blow that would take them\ncenturies to recover, if they did at all. Harad was defeated and\nconcluded a peace with King Aragorn II Elessar, by which Umbar, whose\nfleet had been completely destroyed in the mouths of the Anduin, was\nreturned to Gondor, and South Gondor also annexed. The Easterlings also\nsuffered a terrible defeat as their Orc allies fled in terror from the\nBattle of the Black Gate. However, King Elessar, his descendants and\nallies such as King Éomer still on occasion warred with their enemies\nover land, particularly over the bitterly contested region of the Sea of\nRhûn. King Elessar died in FO 120 and was succeeded by his son Eldarion\nwho ruled until about FO 220. Of the kings of the Reunited Kingdom after\nhim, nothing is known.\n\nTolkien said that he thought the distance between the end of the Third\nAge and the 20th century A.D. was about 6000 years, and that 1958 should\nhave been around the end of the Fifth Age if the Fourth and Fifth Ages\nwere about the same length as the Second and Third Ages. He said,\nhowever, in a letter written in 1958 that he believed the Ages had\nquickened and that it was about the end of the Sixth Age or beginning of\nthe Seventh (this letter is referred to in the “Fourth Age” article of\n_The Encyclopedia of Arda,_ as mentioned below)."

    "text": "SINDARIN was the Elvish language most commonly spoken in Middle-earth\nduring in the Third Age - in the real world it is universally referred\nto as, when not in canonical context, “ELVEN” or “ELVISH”.\n\nThe written alphabet of Sindarin, as with Quenya, is typically Tengwar\n(the Feanorian Characters), although Cirth (Runes) can also be used.\n\n\nHistory\n\n It was the language of the Sindar,\nthose Teleri who chose to stay behind on the Great Journey of the Elves.\nIt was derived from an earlier language called “Common Telerin”. When\nthe Ñoldor came back to Middle-earth, they adopted the Sindarin\nlanguage, for the Sindar were more numerous and slower to learn the\nlanguage of Valinor, Quenya the Noldor's native language. Later events\nled to the banning of the use of Quenya within and around Beleriand\nleading to it's eventual use as a high language of law. Before the\ndownfall, most of the Men of Númenor also spoke the language. Knowledge\nof it was kept in the Númenorean realm in exile Gondor, especially among\nthe learned. Dwarves, notably Durin's Folk, used Sindarin when\ncommunicating with Elves. Sindarin is the language referred to as _the\nElven-tongue_ in _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\nTolkien originally imagined that the language which would become\n_Sindarin_ was spoken by the Ñoldor (second clan of Elves). However he\nlater decided that it was the language of the Sindar. For this reason it\nis called _Noldorin_ in the older material, such as the Etymologies.\nWhen Noldorin became Sindarin, it also adopted some features of the\noriginally unrelated language _Ilkorin_. Tolkien based the sound and\nsome of the grammar of his Noldorin/Sindarin on Welsh, and Sindarin\ndisplays of the consonant mutations that characterise the Celtic\n(especially Brythonic) languages. The language was also probably\ninfluenced to an extent by the Germanic languages, as Tolkien was a\nscholar of both Old English and Old Norse.\n\n\nGrammar\n\nSindarin is mainly analytic, though traits of its highly inflected\nprogenitor can still be seen.\n\nPhonology\n\nSindarin was designed to have a Welsh-like phonology. It has most of the\nsame sounds and similar phonotactics.\n\n  -------- ----- -------------------------------------------------------------\n  LETTER   IPA   NOTES\n  a              \n  b              \n  c              \n  ch             The “ch” in the German word “Buch”, not as in “church”\n  d              \n  dh             The “th” in “heather”\n  e              \n  f              Represents  when final or before n,  everywhere else.\n  g              \n  h              \n  hw             \n  i              Represents  when initial,  everywhere else.\n  l              \n  lh       ɬ     The same as the Welsh LL.\n  m              \n  n              \n  ng             Represents  when final,  everywhere else.\n  o              \n  p              \n  ph             Represents  when final,  everywhere else.\n  r              \n  rh             \n  s              \n  t              \n  th             The “th” in “heath”\n  u              \n  v              \n  w              \n  y              Pronounced like German _ü_\n  -------- ----- -------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn accent signifies a long vowel (á, é, etc.). In a monosyllabic word, a\ncircumflex is used (â, ê, etc.). However, for practical reasons, users\nof the ISO Latin-1 character set often substitute ý for ŷ.\n\nDiphthongs are _ai_ (pronounced like AIsle), _ei_ (dAY), _ui_ (tOO\nYoung), _au_ (cOW), and _oi_ (bOY). If the last diphthong finishes a\nword, it is spelt _aw_. There are also diphthongs _ae_ and _oe_ with no\nEnglish counterparts; Tolkien recommended to substitute _ai_ and _oi_\nrespectively if one does not care about details. If one does care, it is\nsimilar to pronouncing _a_ or _o_ respectively in the same syllable as\none pronounces an _e_ (as in pEt).\n\nIn archaic Sindarin, there was a vowel similar to German _ö_ (IPA: ),\nwhich Tolkien mostly transcribed as _œ_ (usually _not_ as _oe_ as is\noften found in publications like the Silmarillion, cf. _Nirnaeth\nArnoediad_ , _Goelydh_ ).\nThis vowel later came to be pronounced and is therefore transcribed as\nsuch .\n\nArchaic Sindarin also had a spirant _m_ or nasal _v_ (IPA: ), which was\ntranscribed as _mh_ (though always pronounced in later Sindarin).\n\nNouns\n\nPluralization\n\nSindarin plurals are characterised by _i-affection_, or _umlaut_. The\nSindarin term for this is _prestanneth_ (disturbance, affection). Almost\nall Sindarin words form their plurals like English man/men and\ngoose/geese — by changing the vowels in the word. The plural patterns\nare:\n\n-   In non-final syllables:\n    -   a > e — galadh > gelaidh\n    -   e > e — bereth > berith\n    -   i > i — dineth > dinith\n    -   o > e — gowest > gewist\n    -   u > y — tulus > tylys\n    -   y > y — (no example available)\n-   In final syllables:\n    -   a > ai — anar > enair\n    -   â > ai — tâl > tail\n    -   e > i — adaneth > edenith\n    -   ê > î — hên > hîn\n    -   i > i — brennil > brennil\n    -   î > î — dîs > dîs\n    -   o > y — brannon > brennyn\n    -   ó > ý — bór > býr\n    -   ô > ý — thôn > thýn\n    -   u > y — urug > yryg\n    -   û > ui — hû > hui\n    -   y > y — ylf > ylf\n    -   ý > ý — mýl > mýl\n    -   au > oe — naug > noeg\n\nNote that _ai_ can sometimes become _î_ (or, less commonly, _ý_).\n\nThe reason for this is that the primitive plural ending _-î_ (still\npresent in Quenya as _-i_) affected the vowels in the word by making\nthem higher and fronter. After this sound change occurred, the suffix\n_-î_ disappeared when all final vowels were lost.\n\nClass Plural\n\nSindarin also has several suffixes which denote a so-called class\nplural. For example, _-ath_ indicates a group of something, e. g.\n_elenath_ from elen (an archaic form of _êl_), meaning _star_ and\n_-ath_. It means _a group of stars_ or _all the stars in the sky_.\nAnother ending, _-rim_, is used to indicate a race, e. g. _nogothrim_\nfrom _nogoth_ — _dwarf_ and _-rim_, meaning _the race of dwarves_. The\nending _-hoth_ is generally used in an unfriendly sense, e. g.\n_gaurhoth_ from _gaur_ — _werewolf_ and _-hoth_, meaning\n_werewolf-host_.\n\nMutation\n\nSindarin has a complex series of mutations. There are three main\ndifferent types of mutations: _soft mutation_ (or lenition), _nasal\nmutation_ and _stop_ (occlusive) _mutation_. Additionally, a _mixed\nmutation_ is also observed after certain particles or prepositions.\nFinally, it is presumed that Sindarin also once had what we could call\nan _archaic spirantal mutation_ (also sometimes called _liquid mutation_\nby scholars). It is still uncertain whether this mutation is still\nproductive or if it only occurs in ancient constructs.\n\nInitial mutations must not be confused with assimilations that may occur\nin compound words (such as, for instance, in the names _Araphor_,\n_Arassuil_ and _Caradhras_).\n\nThe following table outlines how different consonants are affected by\nthe different mutations.\n\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n  BASIC   SOFT   NASAL   MIXED   STOP   LIQUID\n  b       v      m       b       b      v\n  c       g      ch      g       ch     ch\n  d       dh     n       d       d      dh\n  g       '      ng      g       g      '\n  h       ch     ch      h       ch     ch\n  lh      thl    'l      'l      thl    'l\n  m       v      m       m       m      v\n  p       b      ph      b       b      ph\n  rh      thr    'r      'r      thr    'r\n  s       s      s       h       s      s\n  t       d      th      d       th     th\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n\nHere the apostrophe indicates elision.\n\nWords beginning in _b-_, _d-_, or _g-_ which descend from older _mb-_,\n_nd-_, or _ng-_ are affected differently by the mutations:\n\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n  BASIC   SOFT   NASAL   MIXED   STOP   LIQUID\n  b       m      mb      mb      mb     b\n  d       n      nd      nd      nd     d\n  g       ng     g       g       g      g\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n\nTake, for example, the deictic article _i_, which triggers soft\nmutation. When added to a word like _tâl_, it becomes _i dâl_. In\nSindarin's phonological history, _t_ became _d_ in the middle of a word.\nBecause _i tâl_ at the time was considered one word, the _t_ became _d_,\nand thus _i dâl_. However, without the article the word is still _tâl_.\n\nMutation is triggered in various ways:\n\n-   Soft mutation, the most widely occurring mutation, is triggered by\n    the singular article _i_, the prefixes _athra-, ath-, go-, gwa-,\n    ú-,_ and _u-_, as well as the prepositions _ab, am, adel, be, dad,\n    di, na, nu,_ and _î_, and after _avo_. It also affects the second\n    element in a compound, an adjective following a noun, and the object\n    of a verb.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Nasal mutation is triggered by the plural article _in_, and the\n    prepositions _an, dan,_ and plural _'nin_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Mixed mutation is triggered by the genitive article _en_, and the\n    prepositions _ben, erin, nan, 'nin,_ and _uin_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Stop mutation is triggered by the prepositions _ed, ned,_ and\n    _o(d)_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Liquid mutation is presumably triggered by the preposition _or_.\n\nPronouns\n\nPronouns are perhaps the most poorly attested feature of Sindarin. What\nhas been reconstructed by the comparative method is largely conjectural\nand is not agreed upon, and therefore will not be addressed in this\narticle.\n\nSindarin pronouns, like those in English, still maintain some case\ndistinction. Sindarin pronouns have nominative, accusative, genitive,\nand dative forms.\n\n \n\nFirst Person\n\nSecond Person\n\nThird Person\n\n \n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nNominative\n\nim\n\nme\n\nle, ci\n\nle, ci\n\ne, te\n\nti\n\nAccusative\n\nnin\n\nmen\n\nlen, cin\n\nlen, cin\n\nten, den\n\ntin, hain\n\nGenitive\n\n \n\nmín\n\n \n\nlín\n\ndîn\n\n \n\nDative\n\nanim, enni\n\nammen\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEnclitic\n\n-n\n\n-m\n\n-ch\n\n \n\n—\n\n-r\n\nVerbs\n\nSindarin verbs are also quite complex. The number of attested verbs in\nSindarin is small, so the Sindarin verb system is imperfectly known; no\nverb has a full paradigm of forms available. There are two main types of\nverbs: _basic_ and _derived_. Basic verbs have stems which end in a\nconsonant, and derived verbs have stems which incorporate some sort\nderivational morpheme (such as a causative ending) which ends in _-a_.\n\nBasic Verbs\n\nBasic verbs, though smaller in number than derived verbs, have a very\ncomplex conjugation which arises from Sindarin's phonological history.\n\nBasic verbs form the infinitve by adding _-i_: _giri_ from _gir-_. This\nending causes an _a_ or _o_ in the stem to umlaut to _e_: _blebi_ from\n_blab-_. Sindarin does not use infinitive forms very often, and rather\nuses the gerund to achieve the same meaning.\n\nFor all persons except the third person singular, the present tense is\nformed by the insertion of _-i_, and the proper enclitic pronomial\nending: _girin_, _girim_, _girir_. As with the infinitive, _-i_ causes\nan _a_ or _o_ in the stem to umlaut to _e_: _pedin_, _pedim_, _pedir_,\nfrom _pad-_. The third person singular, because it has a zero-ending,\ndoes not require the insertion of _-i_. This leaves the bare stem,\nwhich, because of Sindarin's phonological history, causes the vowel of\nthe stem to become long: _gîr_, _blâb_, _pâd_.\n\nThe past tense of basic verbs is very complicated and poorly attested.\nOne common reconstructed system is to use _-n_: _darn_. However, the\nonly time this _-n_ actually remains is after a stem in _-r_. After a\nstem ending in _-l_, _-n_ becomes _-ll_: _toll_. After _-b, -d, -g, -v,_\nor _-dh_, it is metathesized and then assimilated to the same place of\narticulation as the consonant it now follows. The consonant then\nexperiences what could be called a “backwards mutation”: _-b, -d,_ and\n_-g_ become _-p, -b,_ and _-c_, and _-v_ and _-dh_ become _-m_ and _-d_.\nThe matter is complicated even further when pronomial endings are added.\nBecause _-mp, -mb, -nt, -nd,_ and _-nc_ did not survive medially, they\nbecome _-mm-, -mm-, -nn-, -nn-,_ and _-ng_. In addition, past tense\nstems in _-m_ would have _-mm-_ before any pronomial endings. Because\nthis all may seem rather overwhelming, look at these examples which show\nstep-by-step transformations:\n\n-   _cab-_ > **_cabn_ > **_canb_ > **_camb_ > _camp_, becoming _camm-_\n    with any pronomial endings.\n-   _ped-_ > **_pedn_ > **_pend_ > _pent_, becoming _penn-_ with any\n    pronomial endings.\n-   _dag-_ > **_dagn_ > **_dang_ (_n_ pronounced as in _men_) > **_dang_\n    (_n_ pronounced as in _sing_) > _danc_, becoming _dang-_ with any\n    pronomial endings.\n-   _lav-_ > **_lavn_ > **_lanv_ > **_lanm_ > **_lamm_ > _lam_, becoming\n    _lamm-_ before any pronomial endings.\n-   _redh-_ > **_redhn_ > **_rendh_ > **_rend_ > _rend_, becoming\n    _renn-_ before any pronomial endings.\n\nThe future tense is formed by the addition of _-tha_. An _-i_ is also\ninserted between the stem and _-tha_, which again causes _a_ and _o_ to\numlaut to _e_. Endings for all persons except for the first person\nsingular can be added without any further modification: _giritham_,\n_blebithar_. The first person singular ending _-n_ causes the _-a_ in\n_-tha_ to become _-o_: _girithon_, _blebithon_, _pedithon_.\n\nThe imperative is formed with the addition of _-o_ to the stem: _giro!_,\n_pado!_, _blabo!_.\n\nDerived Verbs\n\nDerived verbs have a much less complex conjugation because they have a\nthematic vowel (usually _a_) which reduces the number of consonant\ncombinations which occur.\n\nThe infinitive is formed with -o, which replaces the -a of the stem, e.\ng. _lacho_ from _lacha-_.\n\nThe present tense is formed without modification to the stem. Pronomial\nendings are added without any change.\n\nThe past tense is formed with the ending _-nt_, which becomes _-nne_\nwith any pronomial endings, e. g. _erthant_, _erthanner_.\n\nThe future tense is formed with _-tha_. With the addition of the first\nperson singular _-n_, this becomes _-tho_.\n\nThe imperative is formed like the infinitive.\n\n\nDialects\n\nDuring the First Age there were several dialects of Sindarin:\n\n-   _Doriathrin_ or the language of Doriath, a form of the language\n    which preserved many archaic forms;\n-   _Falathrin_ or the language of the Falas, later also spoken in\n    Nargothrond;\n-   _North Sindarin_, the dialects originally spoken in Dorthonion and\n    Hithlum by the Sindar, these dialects contained many unique words\n    and were not fully intelligible with the Sindarin of Beleriand\n    proper.\n\nWith the exception of Doriathrin, the dialects were changed under\nÑoldorin influence, and adopted many Quenya features, as well as unique\nsound changes devised by the Ñoldor (who loved changing languages). The\ndistinct dialects disappeared after the Ñoldor and Sindar were dispersed\nduring the later Battles of Beleriand. In the refuges on the Isle of\nBalar and the Mouths of Sirion a new dialect arose under the refugees,\nwhich mainly took after Falathrin. During the Second Age and Third Age\nSindarin was a lingua franca for all Elves and their friends, until it\nwas displaced as the Common tongue by Westron, a descendant of Adûnaic\nwhich was heavily influenced by Sindarin.\n\n_Sindarin_ is actually a Quenya term. The Sindarin word was perhaps\nEDHELLEN (“Elvish”).\n\n\nSample Phrases\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings_\n\n-   _Ai na vedui Dúnadan! Mae govannen!_ - Ah, at last, Westman!

    "text": "ERIADOR was a large region situated in northwestern Middle-earth. It was\nlocated between the Blue Mountains (to the west) and the Misty Mountains\n(to the east).\n\n\nDescription and Climate\n\nAccording to _The Atlas of Middle-earth_, Eriador was about six-hundred\nmiles (approximately 965.5 kilometers) from east to west. It was\nmostly lowlands. Hill areas were mainly in around the realms of Arnor,\nthe Shire in the center of the region and in the far eastern parts near\nthe Misty Mountains. Plains and bottomlands were in the south and\nsouthwestern parts. A plateau area existed in the area where Rivendell\nand the Trollshaws were located. Eriador was largely made up of\nscattered woodlands with scrublands in the north and northeastern parts.\nThe rest were short grasslands mainly in the center of the region.\n\nThe climate was mainly humid with relatively mild to cold winters with a\nconstantly warm and moist prevailing wind blowing over the Blue\nMountains. In the northern part, cold and dry prevailing winds blow down\nfrom the polar north influencing the climate as well.\n\nMost of the population was concentrated in the center area around Arnor\nand the Shire and the dominant language was Westron at least by the\nThird Age.\n\nIts boundaries were:\n\n-   To the east, the Misty Mountains.\n-   To the north, the Ice-Bay of Forochel, which flooded part of the\n    lands of Morgoth after the War of Wrath.\n-   To the west, the Blue Mountains.\n-   To the south, the river Greyflood and the land of Enedwaith. After\n    the War of Wrath, part of the southwestern border lies along the\n    shores of Belegaer.\n\nImportant rivers were the Lune (Elvish _Lhûn_), the Brandywine or\n_Baranduin_ in Elvish and the Greyflood.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the Second Age, and possibly much earlier, it was largely forested,\nbut Men cleared the land for farming and the massive old forests never\nrecovered. Much of it was encompassed in the early Third Age by the\nkingdom of Arnor, which later split into the rival kingdoms of Rhudaur,\nArthedain and Cardolan. The Shire occupies part of the former Kingdom of\nArthedain, while Bree and its neighbouring villages lie on the border\nwith the former Cardolan. The Barrow-wights dwell within ancient burial\nmounds constructed in the First Age by the Edain as they journeyed to\nBeleriand. Other important places in Eriador are Rivendell and the\nabandoned kingdoms of Eregion and Angmar.\n\nAt the beginning of the Second Age, large populations of both regular\nMen and Dúnedain inhabited the region. There was also a group of\nNoldorin exiles living in Eregion, near Moria and also located in the\nwestern most region of Eriador (and also in Middle-earth) was the High\nElven Kingdom of Lindon, once the greatest and mightiest kingdom of\nMiddle earth. Sauron's assault on the Elves of Eregion laid waste to\nthat land, and many of the Elves of the Lindon fell in the War of the\nLast Alliance.\n\nEven after his fall, Sauron's evil spirit acted through his agents, such\nas the Witch-king of Angmar, and he also concocted virulent plagues\nwhich swept over the land. Between warfare against the surviving\nDúnedain kingdoms, the plagues, and the general lawlessness sweeping\nover the land, the population dropped considerably. The Angmar War\nturned Eriador into a beautiful, but mostly wild and untamed land, and\nthe only concentration of Elves was either in the valley of Rivendell or\nLindon.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ERIADOR_ is a Sindarin word that meant 'Lonely land' or\n'Lone-lands'.",

    "text": "The WAR OF THE RING was fought between Sauron and the free people of\nMiddle-earth for control of the One Ring and dominion over the\ncontinent. It took place at the end of the Third Age. Together with the\nQuest of Mount Doom, it is one of the overarching plot-lines of _The\nLord of the Rings_.\n\nThe war was initiated by Sauron, who had gained strength since the end\nof the Second Age and sought the One Ring. During the War of the Ring,\nmany thousands of Men of Rohan and Men of Gondor were killed. The\noverall number of combatants in the war is estimated to be over one\nmillion—tens of thousands from the side of the Free Peoples and hundreds\nof thousands from the Evil side. The war also signified the decline of\nthe Elves' power in Middle-earth, the rise of Men in the West, the\nrestoration of the King of Gondor and Arnor and the start of the Fourth\nAge.\n\nBattles were fought in Gondor, Rohan, Lórien, Mirkwood, at the Lonely\nMountain and at Dale. These were primarily waged against Sauron's\nforces, but Saruman, a third contender, also had armies, who fought\nbattles at the Fords of Isen and Helm's Deep.\n\nThe first full-scale battle fought in the war was the first Battle of\nthe Fords of Isen, and the war ended after the Battle of Bywater and,\nshortly afterwards, the deaths of Saruman and Gríma Wormtongue. Towards\nthe end of the War of the Ring, Elessar was crowned King of Gondor, and\nforgave the Men who had fought under Sauron, heralding a great renewal\nof cooperation and communication between Men, Elves, and Dwarves.\n\n\nOrigins of the War\n\nAccording to Mithrandir, the War of the Ring had begun at the\ntime Thorin Oakenshield met Bilbo Baggins in The Shire. Gandalf's\nreasoning is explained in the book _Unfinished Tales_. This is an\nexcerpt from a narrative of Gandalf to Frodo set in a house in Minas\nTirith. “_You may think that Rivendell was out of his reach, but I did\nnot think so. The state of things in the North was very bad. The Kingdom\nUnder the Mountain and the Strong Men of Dale were no more. To resist\nany force that Sauron might send North to regain Angmar were only the\nDwarves of the Iron Hills, and behind them lay desolation and a Dragon.\nThe Dragon Sauron might use with terrible effect._” That is why Gandalf\nthought that he had to get rid of Smaug, and he chanced upon Thorin and\nBilbo at different times, and saw the way to do it, which is told in\n_The Hobbit_.\n\nGandalf's role\n\nGandalf was to the Free Peoples of Middle-earth as a field marshal is to\nhis army fighting on the field—a master strategist and tactician. As\nseen in the opening stages of _The Fellowship of the Ring_ book and\nmovie, Gandalf the Grey would spend many hours, searching, scavenging,\nand sifting out archaic maps and accounts in long-hidden archives strewn\nabout Middle-earth. He would often carefully examine them, figuring out\nthe best way to defeat the Enemy and marshal as many allies as possible\nto his cause.\n\nGandalf likely spent much thought in strategy, before implementing his\nplans to maximum effect. He had been roaming Middle-earth for many years\nduring the Third Age, before Sauron's power was at its apex. He might\nhave had a 'hit list' of targets to neutralize that Sauron might use in\nthe next war upon the Free Peoples. One of these targets was Smaug, as\nseen in _The Hobbit._\n\nGandalf's adaptability and aptitude for strategy proved invaluable to\nhis allies during the complicated web that was to prove to become the\nWar of the Ring. As told in _Unfinished Tales_, Gandalf had known for\nquite a while that Sauron's use of Smaug would virtually guarantee\nvictory over his enemies, namely those of Gondor. He and his Dwarf\ncompanions thus set out to destroy Smaug, and bring the victory of the\nWar of the Ring one step closer for the Free Peoples.\n\nThe Roles of the other Istari\n\nSaruman became the secondary enemy in the War of the Ring, originally\nhaving served the Free Peoples and eventually succumbing to the power of\nthe One Ring.\n\nThe two Blue Wizards, Alatar and Pallando, also served an important role\nin the outcome of the war. Although they weren't directly mentioned in\nthe _Lord of the Rings_, they were enemies of Sauron, and might have\nused the Dark Elves and the Dwarves of the Red Mountains to weaken the\nEasterlings.\n\n\nEvents\n\nSouthern Theatre\n\nThe objective of Sauron's grand strategy was to defeat the strongest of\nthe nations that opposed him, Gondor, and to do so he would need to take\nthe capital city and greatest fortress of Gondor, Minas Tirith. To this\nend, the war effort of Mordor was focused in the south in and around\nGondor, in a strategy of divide and conquer. To keep Gondor's ally\nRohan, on its northern border, from sending aid, Sauron promoted the\nrise of Saruman at Isengard to the west of Rohan. Thus all of Rohan's\nforces would be focused in the west trying to stem the tide of the\nIsengard attack, and none would be sent to Minas Tirith's defence.\nMeanwhile, Sauron sent the Mordor-allied Corsairs of Umbar to attack\nGondor's populous southern coastal fiefs, which as a result sent only a\nfraction of their forces to defend Minas Tirith in northern Gondor,\nwhile the rest stayed on the coasts preparing for the Corsair assault.\nHowever, Sauron's divide and conquer strategy was ultimately foiled and\na united front of Gondor and Rohan's forces faced Mordor.\n\nRohan\n\nThe War of the Ring started in Rohan when Saruman's troops crossed the\nFords of Isen. Théodred, the son of the King Théoden, had mustered his\nforces on the fords in order to launch a surprise attack against the\nenemy. On February 23, 3019 he attacked the vanguard of the Orcs\nmarching out of Isengard. Reinforcements were quickly sent from Isengard\nhowever, and Théodred ordered a retreat. His forces retreated to an\nisland in the fords, but they were soon surrounded and he was killed.\nGrimbold managed to hold the island, but would not have succeeded if\nElfhelm had not come with reinforcements from Helm's Deep. Thus the\nfirst battle of the Fords of Isen ended in victory for the Rohirrim.\n\nNow that the Marshal of the Westmark was dead, Erkenbrand took command\nof the Westfold. He placed Grimbold and Elfhelm at the Fords. However,\nthey were unable to withstand the force of Isengard, and were\nsurrounded. Though they successfully broke through the enemy's lines,\nthey ended up scattered around the Westfold, giving Saruman clear\npassage into Rohan.\n\nMeanwhile, Gandalf drove Gríma Wormtongue out of Edoras and went to\ngather Erkenbrand's scattered forces, advising King Théoden to move to\nthe stronghold of Helm's Deep. The king and his forces arrived\nunmolested, but soon the fortress was surrounded by Saruman's troops.\nAll through the night of March 3rd-4th a combined force of Orcs and Wild\nMen from Dunland besieged Helm's Deep, and despite the efforts of the\nRohirrim (aided by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli) hope appeared lost.\nBelieving Rohan was lost, Théoden decided to mount a final, suicidal\ncharge against Saruman's forces. Unexpectedly, however, Gandalf arrived\nin the nick of time with Erkenbrand and the scattered Rohirrim, along\nwith a forest of Huorns who had been sent to the battle by Treebeard.\nThe Orcs were trapped and utterly annihilated. The wild Men were taken\ncaptive, however, were freed after swearing an oath of loyalty to Rohan\nand clearing the battlefield of the dead. (The mercy of this act amazed\nthe captives, who had been told by Saruman that the men of Rohan were\ncruel and burned their captives alive.)\n\nDays before, at an Entmoot in Fangorn Forest, the Ents, furious over the\ndestruction Saruman had wrought upon the forest, decided to march on\nIsengard. They were to move up to Isengard and destroy it. By 3 March\nthe destruction was completed, and the command of Isengard was taken by\nthe Ent Treebeard. At Gandalf's request he sent a large herd of Huorns\nto the Battle of Hornburg, to aid the Rohirrim.\n\nGondor\n\nFor over 3000 years, the realm of Gondor had held back the threat from\nthe East. In time, the kingdom declined, and Sauron prepared to swoop in\nfor the kill. Faramir, captain of Gondor, had divided his forces to too\nmany fronts. The two most important of these were in the island citadel\nof Cair Andros and the ruined city of Osgiliath. In a strict sense, the\nWar of the Ring began with the Great Signal from Minas Morgul and the\nanswering signal from Mount Doom, and thus the attack on Osgiliath was\nthe first battle of the war proper. Sauron's two armies obliterated the\nfortresses, and Faramir was forced to retreat to the causeway forts, the\nlast defence against the Morgul forces. Soon these too were destroyed,\nand only Minas Tirith remained.\n\nThe attack soon began, as the Nazgûl hovered above and spread terror and\nconfusion, and siege towers tried to take the walls but were all\ndestroyed. After several repulsed attacks, the Gate of Minas Tirith was\nbroken, and the Lord of the Nazgûl entered. He was the first and only\nenemy to do so. All seemed lost — until six thousand Rohirrim, under\nKing Théoden's command, came and somewhat relieved Gondor's defenders.\nStill, the battle was in doubt until Aragorn arrived with a large force\nout of South Gondor. The joint force of Gondor and Rohan then\nsuccessfully defeated their enemies after an exhausting day of fighting.\nThis battle resulted in the deaths of the Witch-king of Angmar, King\nTheoden, and Denethor, Steward of Gondor.\n\nThe Battle of the Morannon was the final major battle against Sauron in\nthe War of the Ring, fought at the Black Gate of Mordor. The Army of the\nWest, roughly 6,000 strong, led by Aragorn marched on the gate and faced\na vastly larger force as a diversionary feint to distract Sauron's\nattention from Frodo and Sam, who were carrying the One Ring through\nMordor. It was hoped that Sauron would think Aragorn had the Ring and\nwas now trying to use it to overthrow Mordor. Despite the seemingly\nimpossible odds the Army of the West was eventually victorious, for when\nthe Ring was destroyed, Sauron's forces fled or surrendered in dismay.\n\nNorthern Theatre\n\nMordor's war effort was focused in the south against Gondor, but using\nhis outstretched right arm Sauron attempted to flank the lands of the\nFree Peoples through Rhovanion, using orcs and allied barbarian nations\nof Men. In this theatre of the war (which had spread far across\nMiddle-earth) Sauron's primary objective was to use the forces at his\nprimary base of operations in the area, Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood,\nto defeat Lothlórien, then pass the Misty Mountains (attacking\nRivendell), and wheel around to take Rohan and Gondor from the rear.\nHowever, Dol Guldur had to deal with the threat of the Woodland Realm of\nThranduil, and thus split their forces between the attack on Lothlórien\nand the one on the Woodland Realm. Sauron wanted to use his barbarian\nEasterling allies in a joint attack with the Orcs from Dol Guldur on the\nWoodland Realm, and then have this victorious army link up with the\nother ones attacking Lothlórien and defeat it. However, unfortunately\nfor Sauron a strong and extremely powerful Dwarf nation now existed at\nthe Lonely Mountain thanks to the efforts of Gandalf, as well as the\nDwarves of the Iron Hills and allied Men of Dale. Mordor's Easterling\nallies were tied up fighting the Dwarves of Erebor and Men of Dale,and\nnever linked up with the Mordor forces assaulting the Woodland Realm,\nwhich in turn could not link up with those attacking Lothlórien, and the\nline held.\n\nBridging the gap between the northern and southern theatres of the war\nwas the line of the River Anduin between Lothlórien and Gondor, running\nalong the Rohan border. Orc armies peeling off from the assault on\nLothlórien tried to enter Rohan via this route, while almost its entire\narmy had left to fight at Minas Tirith, but the Ents of Fangorn forest\ncounterattacked and drove the orcs back in a panic, and most if not all\ndrowned while attempting to flee by crossing the river.\n\nDale and the Lonely Mountain\n\nWhen the war began, the Dwarves of Erebor\nrefused to cooperate with Sauron in his hunt for the Ring. And so Sauron\nsent an army of Easterlings to Dale. On March 17 they met the armies of\nthe Dwarves of Erebor (and of the Iron Hills as well) and the Men of\nDale. After three days of fighting, Men and Dwarves were overrun, Dale\nwas sacked and razed to ash (the second, possibly third, time in a\ncentury) and sought refuge in Erebor. The defenses of the Lonely\nMountain were prepared for the battle that would decide the fate of\nnorthern Middle-earth, and possibly even the War of the Ring itself.\n\nThe Easterlings hurled their full force at the allied armies, exploiting\ntheir dreaded heavy infantry force to punch a hole in the Dwarvish and\nMannish lines. A furious melee ensued, evolving into a tempest of fire,\ndead and dying men, and the flash of steel. Both sides took horrendous\nlosses, the Easterlings from the arrows, spears, and rocks cast from the\nLonely Mountain's cliffs, and the Men and Dwarves from the scimitars and\nmaces of the Easterlings. Finally, King Brand of Dale fell before the\ngate of the Lonely Mountain, and King under the Mountain Dáin II\nIronfoot fell as he was defending Brand's body.\n\nThe Dwarves of Erebor had learnt a crucial lesson from the devastation\nof Smaug and the Battle of the Five Armies nearly a century earlier, a\nlesson bought with the blood of loved ones. They fortified all of the\nsides of the Lonely Mountain, preventing the breakthrough of orcs that\nnearly caused the loss of the Battle in the days of Bilbo Baggins and\nThorin Oakenshield. The defenders knew with grim fatalism that there\nwould be no Beorn and no Eagles to save them this time, and they were\nthus determined to fight to the last. The Lonely Mountain was staged to\nbecome the Minas Tirith of the North, a ruthless battle of the will of\nthe defender and the will of the aggressor.\n\nThe invaders from the east constructed siege works, battering rams, and\nassorted siege catapults to bombard their enemies into submission.\nHowever, despite all of their efforts, the great gates of the Lonely\nMountain withstood the tidal wave of invaders from the East. Many Men\nand Dwarves made their escape to Erebor however and were able to\nwithstand the siege of the mountain fastness. When news spread about the\nvictory in the South, the Easterlings became extremely demoralized and\nproceeded to scatter, while the sons of Brand and Dáin let their army\nout of Erebor to break the encirclement.\n\nLothlórien and Mirkwood\n\nOn March 11, Lothlórien was first attacked from Dol Guldur. It was\nattacked two further times, on the 15 and the 22. When the Dark Lord had\nfallen, Celeborn led his army out of Lóerin, and crossed the Anduin. Dol\nGuldur was captured and destroyed by Galadriel.\n\nThranduil of Mirkwood was also attacked from Dol Guldur on March 15\nresulting in the long Battle Under the Trees, in which Thranduil's\nkinfolk won a hard victory. After the destruction of Dol Guldur,\nCeleborn met Thranduil on April 6, and as the shadow had passed, they\ndivided Mirkwood and renamed it Eryn Lasgalen.\n\nThe Shire\n\nAfter the defeat of the Dark Lord, Saruman used the magic of his voice\nto convince Treebeard to release him from Isengard. He travellled to the\nShire, where he replaced Lotho Sackville-Baggins as the Chief under the\nname _Sharkey_. Under his command Ruffian men entered The Shire and\nruined it. They were defeated by Hobbits under the lead of Meriadoc\nBrandybuck and Peregrin Took in the Battle of Bywater on the 3rd of\nNovember. The Hobbits headed to Hobbiton where Frodo ordered Saruman and\nWormtongue to leave the Shire. Wormtongue, however, killed Saruman,\nbefore he himself was killed by the Hobbits and their arrows. With the\ndeath of the wizard Saruman, the War of the Ring finally ended, as did\nthen the Third Age.\n\n\nConsequences and Legacy\n\nThe War of the Ring had great influence on all of the lands of the\nnorthwest of Middle-earth. Most importantly it led to the restoration of\nthe Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor as the Reunited Kingdom, under King\nElessar Telcontar. The Steward of Gondor was dead, but he was succeeded\nby his son Faramir, who kept the office and was given the title _Prince\nof Ithilien_.\n\nIn Rohan the heir apparent, Théodred, was killed, and, during the Battle\nof Pelennor Fields, King Théoden died as well. He was succeeded by his\nnephew Éomer. In the Glittering Caves at the Hornburg, a Dwarven colony\nwas established, and Isengard was given to the Ents, who filled\nSaruman's pits and reforested the land, renaming it The Treegarth of\nOrthanc\n\nIn Dale, both King Brand and King Dáin II Ironfoot were killed, who were\nsucceeded by their sons Bard and Thorin III Stonehelm. They sent their\nemissaries to the crowning of Elessar, and were in alliance with Gondor\nuntil their Kingdoms ended.\n\nFor the Elves, the final decline had begun. With the destruction of the\nOne Ring, the power of the Three Rings faded, and the kingdoms that had\nbeen preserved by their magic began to fade with them. The bearers of\nthe Rings left Middle-earth, and Lórien was eventually abandoned. The\nElves of Lothlórien who did not depart over the Sea moved east to the\nsouthern third of Mirkwood, below the Narrows, which they named East\nLórien. In Eryn Lasgalen however, Thranduil's rule continued, and they\nhad peace. There was also an Elven colony in Ithilien. Many of the Elves\nof Rivendell departed over the Sea, and by Aragorn's death 120 years\nlater, it was entirely deserted.\n\nIn the Shire life continued as it had prior to the war. It was declared\na free land under the Sceptre of Annúminas, and Men were forbidden to\nenter it. The Westmarch was added to the Shire by King Elessar in SR\n1452.\n\nThe different races of Men that had served Sauron suffered grievously at\nthe hands of what appeared to be booty and loot just begging them to\ncome; much of Harad's army was annihilated on the Pelennor Fields,\nslaughtered by the swords of Gondor and the lances of Rohan. The mighty\nEasterlings hastily retreated back to their homelands after Sauron's\nfall and fought several territorial wars with King Elessar over lands\nnear the Sea of Rhûn, but ceased to be a threat altogether. While they\nwere still a menace, much like a sleeping viper, they never troubled the\nReunited Kingdom again.\n\nOnce the Fourth Age began, the elves stopped having an active influence\non the affairs of Middle-earth, having started fading away ever since\nthe Third Age. Orcs never became a serious threat again, reduced to\nsmall bands of mountain brigands they were never more than a nuisance.\nAll the Nazgûl were killed, with Sauron reduced to a mere shadow of\nmalice. Wars would still be fought by the Reunited Kingdom and Rohan\nagainst the Men that had allied with Sauron, the Haradrim and\nEasterlings."

    "title": "Gondor",
    "page_id": "163",
    "text": "GONDOR was the prominent kingdom of Men in Middle-earth, bordered by\nRohan to the north, Harad to the south, the cape of Andrast and the Sea\nto the west, and Mordor to the east. Its first capital was Osgiliath,\nmoved to Minas Tirith in TA 1640. The city of Minas Tirith remained the\ncapital of Gondor for the rest of the Third Age and into years of the\nFourth Age; other major fortresses include Dol Amroth in Belfalas and\nOsgiliath, which was a city on the Anduin.\n\nGondor was founded by the brothers Isildur and Anárion, exiles from\nNúmenor. Gondor was an allied kingdom with Arnor, whose line of king\nchieftains came from Isildur, while the Line of the Kings of Gondor was\nfrom Anárion. Gondor was at the height of its power in its early years\ndue to the ships and the military might that its armies possessed.\nHowever, continued attacks by allies of Sauron, civil war, and a\ndevastating plague caused it to gradually decline over the course of the\nThird Age until Sauron's final defeat and the crowning of Aragorn II\nElessar. Following that time the power of Gondor once again expanded,\nuntil the former lands of Arnor were brought under the banner of the\nReunited Kingdom. \n\nIn all, there were thirty-one kings of Gondor after Anárion, who was\nslain before Barad-dûr at the Siege of Barad-dûr. \n\n\nHistory\n\nLike Arnor to the north, Gondor was a Mannish kingdom founded by\nAnárion, the youngest son of Elendil, after the Downfall of Númenor. It\nwas located to the South of Rohan and to the West of Mordor, on the Bay\nof Belfalas.\n\nEarly years\n\n Before the Downfall of Númenor,\nGondor was home to many Númenórean colonists, who either mixed blood\nwith the indigenous Middle Men if they were friendly, or dispersed them\ninto Ras Morthil, Dunland, and Drúadan Forest. Gondor, at a latitude\ncomparable to Venice, was a more fertile region than Arnor to the north,\nand therefore it already had a larger population before the ships of\nElendil's sons arrived, including a well-established city, Pelargir.\n\nThe Faithful or Elendili from Númenor were given a warm reception upon\ntheir arrival by those that had already colonized Middle-earth,\nincluding a colonial branch of Númenorean royalty at Dor-en-Ernil. The\ncolonists north of Anduin accepted Elendil's claim to kingship over\nthem. South of the Great River, however, the newly exiled Númenoreans\ndid not recognize Elendil's claim.\n\nGondor was being founded after Númenor's population had already split\nbetween The Faithful and King's Men, and all of the more southern\ncolonies (such as Umbar) remained enemies of The Faithful.\n\nThe newly founded kingdom of Gondor was then part of the Last Alliance\nof Elves and Men which overthrew Sauron for the first time at the very\nend of the Second Age, and when Isildur cut the finger of Sauron.\n\nGondor Prospers\n\nAfter the war, Gondor's power and wealth grew steadily (only interrupted\nby an Easterling invasion in TA 492). Its power would continue to grow\ninto the 9th century Third Age. While the power of Gondor's sister\nkingdom Arnor peaked during the 9th century, when it broke into various\nsuccessor states, Gondor's greatest glory was yet to come. Gondor's\ngreat cities Minas Anor, Minas Ithil, Osgiliath and Pelargir only grew\nand the Dunedain of Gondor started to rule over more and more of the\nlesser people.\n\nGondor's Golden Age\n\n\n\nGondor's power reached its Golden Age under the four “Ship-kings”:\n\n-   Tarannon Falastur r. TA 830 – TA 913. First of the Ship-Kings, died\n    childless\n-   Eärnil I r. TA 913 – TA 936. Nephew of Tarannon\n-   Ciryandil r. TA 936 – TA 1015\n-   Hyarmendacil I (Ciryaher) r. TA 1015 - TA 1149. Last of the\n    Ship-Kings. In the reign of the powerful king, Hyarmendacil I (c.\n    12th century TA) Gondor reached the height of its power. During\n    Hyarmendacil's reign, Gondor's borders reached their furthest\n    extent. The Kingdom extended east to the Sea of Rhûn, south to the\n    nearest lands of the Haradrim, as far north as Mirkwood, and west\n    towards the borders of Arnor.\n\nSuch was Gondor's wealth during the period that men from other lands\nwould say in envy: “In Gondor precious stones are but pebbles for the\nchildren to play with.” Gondor would also enjoy several centuries of\npeace due to its military might.\n\n\n\nThe Decline of Gondor\n\nHowever, after decadence spread under the Kings of Gondor and a long\nperiod of decline began (although Gondor experienced several revivals).\nThree great calamities struck Gondor during the second millennium of the\nThird Age, which are held to be the chief reasons for its decline: the\nKin-strife, the Great Plague, and the invasion of the Wainriders (a\ntribe of Easterlings).\n\nThe Kin-strife\n\nIn the 15th century TA a great civil war named the Kin-strife tore the\nnation apart. The current King Eldacar was of mixed blood: his mother\nwas of the Northmen. Popular displeasure at this led to the overthrow of\nKing Eldacar by Castamir, the admiral of all of Gondor's naval forces\nwho possessed some royal blood. Eldacar's son was slain, and he fled\nnorth. Castamir was afterwards known as Castamir the Usurper. During his\nten-year rule, he proved to be very cruel, and because of his love of\nhis old fleet, he lavished attention on the coastal regions while the\ninterior provinces were ignored and left to rot. Eldacar then returned\nwith an army of his Northman kinsmen, and the armies of the Men of\nGondor joined them from interior provinces such as Anórien. Osgiliath\nwas devastated during this conflict, its great bridge destroyed and its\n_Palantír_ lost. Eldacar slew Castamir and reclaimed his throne, but\nCastamir's sons and their forces were besieged in Pelargir, the great\nport of Gondor. They eventually retreated to Umbar, where they joined\nwith the Corsairs, and troubled Gondor for many years, until their\ndescendants died out.\n\nThe Great Plague\n\nLater, the Great Plague struck and the White Tree died. This Plague was\nno localized event: the Plague swept through all of Middle-earth,\nreaching the successor states of Arnor and the Hobbits of the Shire in\nthe North. King Tarondor found a sapling of the White Tree, and moved\nthe capital from Osgiliath to Minas Anor, the City of Anárion. During\nthis time, Gondor was so depopulated that the fortifications guarding\nagainst the re-entry of evil into Mordor were abandoned. It is believed\nthat had the Haradrim or Easterlings been capable of attacking Gondor at\nthis time, it would have fallen. However, the Plague left Gondor's\nenemies in no better condition than Gondor itself, and neither side was\ncapable of mounting new offensives.\n\nThe Invasion of the Wainriders\n\nFollowing the sapping of Gondor's strength by the plague, it did recover\nbut then the Wainrider (Easterlings) invaded and devastated Gondor, and\nthe conflict lasted for almost a century. The Wainriders destroyed the\nNorthern Army of Gondor, but survivors linked up with the victorious\nSouthern Army of Gondor which destroyed the Haradrim as they crossed the\nriver Poros, led by a general named Eärnil, and they destroyed the\nWainriders as they celebrated their victory during the Battle of the\nCamp.\n\nThe Line of the Kings Fails\n\nReunification Rejected\n\nIn TA 1944 Gondor faced a succession crisis when King Ondoher was slain\nin battle with both his sons. Arvedui, Prince of Arthedain, Ondoher's\nson-in-law, and the victorious general Eärnil, who was a distant\nblood-relative of Ondoher, claimed the throne. Arvedui's claim lay\nmainly in the reintroduction of the old Nùmenorean law of accession,\nwhich stated the eldest (remaining) child should succeed the king. If\nthe law was reintroduced, then Arvedui's wife Fíriel, Ondoher's daughter\nand last remaining child, would become Ruling-Queen, making their\ndescendants Kings of both Arnor and Gondor. Arvedui also tried to put\nweight behind his claim, as he was Isildur's heir. The council of Gondor\nrecognised that the name of Isildur was held in honour in Gondor, but\nthey dictated that the South-Kingdom must be ruled by an Heir of\nAnarion. Due to his ancestry from Fíriel and Arvedui, more than a\nmillennium later, Aragorn Elessar put forward his claim as the heir of\nboth Isildur and Anarion.\n\nEärnil laid his claim as being a direct descendant of King Telumehtar\nUmbardacil. His claim was also greatly bolstered by the popularity he\nhad gained as the victorious general who saved Gondor from the\nWainriders after winning the southern theatre of the war. Steward\nPelendur who was temporarily ruling Gondor as serving as arbiter of\nsuccession, intervened in favour of Gondor's victorious general who\nwould rule as Eärnil II.\n\nThe Last Heir of Anárion\n\nDuring the Battle of Fornost, Eärnil II's heir Eärnur led Gondor's\nforces to victory over the Witch-king of Angmar, who was actually the\nLord of the Nazgûl. Although Eärnur wished to fight him, Eärnur's horse\nwas terrified and fled the battle against his wishes. By the time, he\nmastered his horse and returned the Witch-king had fled. Glorfindel the\nElf then prophesied to him that it was better that he not fight the Lord\nof the Nazgûl because “never by the hand of man shall he fall”.\n\nEärnur later ascended to the throne, ruling from Minas Anor (“Tower of\nthe Sun”). During this time, the Ringwraiths captured the city of Minas\nIthil (“Tower of the Moon”), renaming it _Minas Morgul_ (“Tower of Dark\nSorcery”) and taking it as their lair. Minas Anor was renamed _Minas\nTirith_ (Tower of Guard) as a result. The Lord of the Nazgûl repeatedly\nsent messengers to Minas Tirith challenging Eärnur to single combat,\ntaunting him that he had fled out of cowardice from facing him during\nthe Battle of Fornost. Eventually, King Eärnur was overcome by wrath and\nrode with a small company of knights to Minas Morgul, to accept the\nchallenge. They were never heard from again; and so ended the Line of\nAnárion.\n\nThe Stewards of Gondor\n\nThe Ruling Stewards\n\nA long line of hereditary Stewards governed the realm after the\ndisappearance of Eärnur, son of Eärnil, since there was no proof that\nthe last king was dead, and no claimant had enough support to be\naccepted as his successor. The line of Anárion was held to have failed,\nand Gondor was not willing to risk to another Kin-strife, which would\nsurely have destroyed it. Whenever there was a new Steward, he would\nswear an oath to yield rule of Gondor back to the King, in essence only\nan heir of Isildur, if he should ever return. In Gondor, there was no\none who could claim descent from Isildur in direct line, and the\nnorthern line of Arnor had effectively disappeared, so this oath was not\nconsidered seriously. The line of Stewards ruled as Kings, without\nhaving the title. During the War of the Ring, the ruling Steward of\nGondor was Denethor II, and his two sons were Boromir and younger\nFaramir- the latter being the last Ruling Steward of Gondor.\n\nCirion and Eorl\n\nIn TA 2510 when Steward Cirion ruled over Gondor, the nation faced one\nof its greatest perils: an Easterling tribe named the _Balchoth_ invaded\nGondor with mass force. Gondor's army marched to fight the Balchoth but\nwere cut off from Minas Tirith and pushed back in the direction of the\nLimlight.\n\nMessengers were sent to get help from the Éothéod, a tribe, which lived\nin the northern vales of the Anduin, but nobody expected the messengers\nto reach their destination. When certain peril came upon Gondor,\nhowever, the Éothéod turned the tide of the Battle of the Field of\nCelebrant. After the victory the Éothéod were awarded the fields of\nCalenardhon north of the White Mountains from the Gap of Rohan at the\nsouthern end of the Hithaeglir, Fangorn forest, rivers Limlight to\nAnduin, western Emyn Muil, and the Mering Stream, where they established\nthe kingdom of Rohan with Eorl the Young as their first king. A\npermanent alliance between Gondor and Rohan was established by the oath\nEorl swore to Cirion.\n\nThe War of the Ring and the Restoration\n\nSeveral centuries later, Sauron had prepared for the final conquest, and\nin TA 3018 his forces overran Ithilien. The attack was stopped at\nOsgiliath with the destruction of the bridge across the Anduin. The\nfollowing year Minas Tirith faced a larger attack from Mordor, with\nadditional threat from the Corsairs of Umbar. Aragorn summoned the Dead\nMen of Dunharrow to destroy the forces from Umbar, freeing forces in the\nsouth of Gondor to come to the aid of Minas Tirith. Gondor then defeated\nthe army of Mordor with the aid of the Rohirrim in the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields, though with heavy losses. The combined army of the West\nthen carried the battle to Sauron at the Battle of the Morannon, a feint\nto distract Sauron's attention from Frodo Baggins's quest to destroy the\nOne Ring in Mount Doom, thus causing Sauron's destruction and the\nallies' ultimate victory.\n\nAfter the second and final defeat of Sauron, the Kingship was restored,\nwith Aragorn crowned as King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor\nand Gondor. Faramir, last heir of the Ruling Stewards, retained his\noffice as the Steward to the King, and ruled over Gondor's eastern\nregion of Ithilien; a fair land between the river Anduin and the Ephel\nDúath. The oaths between Gondor and Rohan were renewed, and several\njoint campaigns were fought in the east and south against the remnant of\nthe Easterlings and Haradrim; all former territories of the\nSouth-kingdom were won back during the following centuries, and its\npower and wealth were restored. Several Tolkien's writings state that\n_“...of Eldarion son of Elessar it was foretold that he should rule a\ngreat realm, and that it should endure for a hundred generations of men\nafter him, that is until a new age brought in again new things; and from\nhim should come the kings of many realms in long days after”_.\n\n\nArmies\n\nSecond Age\n\nThe soldiers of Gondor were renowned during the Second Age for their\nskill and valour. Training men of Gondor during the Second Age instilled\nwithin their soldiers a martial spirit and ardor, goading them to fight\nto the death against the hordes of Mordor, Rhûn, and Harad. Every man\nwas physically imposing: being very tall at over six feet, very broad,\nand very strong as well. Every single soldier was in peak fighting\ncondition and ready to fight against Sauron's hordes (especially during\nthe War of the Last Alliance). The three major weapons they used were\nspears, longswords, and longbows. They also knew how to form cohesive\nbox-formations, which were sturdy enough for both offensive and\ndefensive purposes. The soldiers wore heavy plate armour and utilised\nlarge shields made out of multi-layered wood and edged in metal for\nreinforcement.\n\nThird Age\n\nGondor's armies prevented Mordor and its allies from overwhelming the\nrest of Middle-earth. Gondor was in a very crucial position, in order to\nguard Middle Earth and because of Gondor's proximity to Mordor, its\nmilitary forces had to be proficiently trained and vigilantly on guard\nat all times. Because of this, they were arguably the strongest country\nthat opposed Sauron. During the Third Age, most of Minas Tirith's armies\nwere trained and drilled to fight in tight infantry formations,\nsupported by archers and cavalry. Their armaments consisted of a\nchainmail undercoat with either a black tabard or plate armor over it.\nTheir standard weapons were long spears, longswords, and longbows,\ncomplimented by tower shields. \n\nMinas Tirith's immediate defenses comprised thousands of infantrymen\nstationed throughout Osgiliath, Cair Andros, and the Rammas Echor. These\nunits were most likely temporary detachments from the city. Minas Tirith\nalso had at least three companies of the elite Guards of the Citadel,\ntasked to defend the upper levels of the city. They wore black robes,\nsurcoats and winged silver crowns. The Guards of the City were not\nallowed to go in the main part of the City in their uniform.\nAdditionally, the sixth level of the city housed stables for a small\nforce of horsemen. Beyond Anduin and the defenses of Minas Tirith\noperated a secretive group of soldiers called the Rangers of Ithilien\nThe Rangers of Ithilien had guerrilla warfare aginst the Southrons,\nallies of Mordor. Similar to the Rangers of the North, the Rangers of\nIthilien were comprised of the remnant of the Dúnedain in their\nrespective Kingdom, in this case being the Dúnedain that once dwelled in\nIthilien.(the Rangers of the North were Arnorian Dúnedain, while the\nRangers of Ithilien are Gondorian- and were more populous than their\nnorthern kin).  Armed with longbows, swords, and spears, these men\nwatched and harassed the enemy throughout Ithilien, much akin to\nguerrilla warfare. The captain of the Rangers of Ithilien during the War\nof the Ring was Faramir, the younger brother of Boromir and the son of\nthe Steward of Gondor, Denethor II.\n\nThe defense of Gondor's fiefdoms were the responsibility of the\nrespective lords of these territories. Their training, strength in\nnumbers, and armaments varied from each fief (Lossarnach brought axemen\nto the aid of Minas Tirith while the men of Morthond Vale consisted of\narchers). The greatest of these fiefs was Dol Amroth, which brought\nforth the largest force to Minas Tirith, made up of men-at-arms and\narguably the best cavalry in Middle Earth- the elite Swan Knights.\n\nGondor's fleet at the time of the War of the Ring was docked at\nPelargir. This port and the Anduin River was essential in the defense of\nMinas Tirith. As made evident by the fiefdom's dire need to defend their\ncoasts and many rivers of Gondor, a majority of the fleet was\nconcentrated at Pelargir. This fleet was destroyed when the Black Ships\nof Umbar attacked, enslaving many of Gondor's sailors into the service\nof Mordor.\n\n\nSong of Gondor\n\n_Gondor! Gondor, between the Mountains and the Sea!_\n\n_West Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver Tree_\n\n_Fell like bright rain in gardens of the Kings of old._\n\n_O proud walls! White towers! O wingéd crown and throne of gold!_\n\n''O Gondor, Gondor! Shall Men behold the Silver Tree, ''\n\n_Or West Wind blow again between the Mountains and the Sea?_\n\nThis was sung by Aragorn on his trip with Legolas and Gimli to find\nPippin and Merry.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Gondor_ name means 'Land of Stone', from Sindarin GOND (stone) + (N)DOR\n(land), most likely given to it because of the White Mountains (Ered\nNimrais) and other mountain chains in the land (hypothetical Quenya name\nONDONÓRË).\n\n\nRegions of Gondor\n\n  Gondor was divided between several nearly\nautonomous regions. These were the following:\n\n-   Ithilien, a region along the east bank of the Anduin river under the\n    shadow of the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow). Ithilien was\n    abandoned and mostly under the control of Mordor during The War of\n    the Ring. (Although Gondor did have secret bases throughout the\n    region such as Henneth Annûn, and the Rangers of Ithilien used\n    guerilla warfare tactics to harass the enemy throughout Ithilien,\n    and disrupt supply lines and companies marching to and from Mordor.\n    After the War of the Ring, Faramir was made Lord Paramount of\n    Ithilien by Aragorn.\n-   South Ithilien, a portion of the the Ithilien south of Osgiliath.\n    The road (the Harad Road) the Southrons took to get to Morder lied\n    here.\n-   Anórien, a strip of land along the northern edge of the White\n    Mountains. Bordered by the Mering Stream and Rohan to the west,\n    Anduin to the east, the Mouths of Entwash to to the north, and\n    theWhite Mountainsand Rammas Echor to the south.\n-   Lossarnach, a heavily-populated farmland region southwest of Minas\n    Tirith.\n-   Lebennin, a plain extending from the White Mountains down to the Bay\n    of Belfalas that bordered Lossarnach.\n-   Belfalas, a fiefdom ruled by the Princes of Dol Amroth.\n-   Dor-en-Ernil, a narrow strip of land along the Bay of Belfalas ruled\n    by the Princes of Dol Amroth.\n-   Lamedon, a plain between the White Mountains and the River Ringló.\n-   Anfalas or _Langstrand_, a narrow strip of land along the sea\n    bordered by the Pinnath Gelin.\n-   Andrast, The western-most province of Gondor located on a narrow\n    peninsula jutting out into the Sea.\n-   Ringló Vale, a mini-province.\n-   Morthond or Blackroot Vale, where Duilin comes from.\n\nThe long cape of Andrast was not populated (by the descendants of\nNúmenóreans, but evidence from the _Unfinished Tales_ suggests that a\nsmall group of Púkel-men inhabited it.)\n\nAdditionally, Gondor held or had held the following regions at certain\npoints in its history:\n\n-   South Gondor or Harondor, an arid region between the rivers Porosand\n    Harnen, which was contested between Gondor and Harad.\n-   Calenardhon, which was given to the Éothéod and became Rohan. It's\n    boundaries were the rivers of Anduin in the east, Isenin the west,\n    Limlightin the north, and the White Mountains/ Mering Stream in the\n    south.\n-   Enedwaith, a region between the rivers Isen and Greyflood. It was\n    never truly populated by Gondor and was soon abandoned.\n-   Rhovanion, which was never fully under the control of Gondor but\n    under Gondorian control at certain times during the Third Age.\n-   Ephel Dúath, the Mountains of Shadow, which was the extreme eastern\n    region of Gondor where she kept watch over Mordor with many\n    fortresses and cities such as Minas Ithil, Durthang, and the Tower\n    of Cirith Ungol. Evil things re-entered Mordor after Gondor's watch\n    upon the land slackened during the Second Age.\n\n\nMajor Sites\n\n Cities, Fortresses, and Strongholds in Gondor included:\n\n-   Cair Andros, an island-fortress in the river Anduin, roughly 40\n    miles north of Osgiliath. Gondor maintained a steady garrison here,\n    as it was of paramount importance to Gondor during the long war with\n    Mordor, in order to prevent the enemy from crossing the river and\n    entering into Anórien.\n\n\n\n-   Calembel, a city in Lamedon.\n-   Dol Amroth, a city in Belfalas ruled by the Prince of Dol Amroth.\n-   Ethring, a ford and a large township built on either side of the\n    river Ringló.\n-   Henneth Annûn, a hidden refuge of Gondorian rangers in the northern\n    part of Ithilien along the Ephel Duath, the Mountains of Shadow.\n-   Linhir, a port city in Lebennin.\n-   Minas Tirith (originally Minas Anor), City of the Kings, the capital\n    (Third Age) and largest city of Gondor.\n-   Osgiliath, a city and former capital of Gondor on the river Anduin,\n    largely destroyed and abandoned by the end of the Third Age. During\n    the War of the Ring, Gondor kept a garrison on the west bank to\n    prevent the Enemy from crossing the river and assaulting Minas\n    Tirith. Osigiliath was the key to besiege Minas Tirith because of\n    its location and access to the river. Although the massive\n    Morgul-host led by the Witch-King to beseige Minas Tirith\n    overwhelmed the garrison, and drove the Gondorians out thus gaining\n    the passage of Anduin- the true beginning of the Siege of Gondor\n    that would conclude at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. King\n    Elessar had it rebuilt after Sauron's downfall.\n-   Pelargir, the great southern harbour, which was captured by the\n    Corsairs during the War of the Ring. The people of Pelargir helped\n    in the Batttle of Pell\n-   Tarnost, a hill-town in Belfalas.\n\nAdditionally, Gondor had held the following locations at certain points\nin its history:\n\n-   Angrenost (Isengard), one of the three Fortresses of Gondor and held\n    within it one of the realm's Palantiri. Its location in Nan\n    Curunir (valley at the end of the Misty Mountains), was at the\n    northwestern corner of the Southern Kingdom of Gondor, guarding the\n    Fords of Isen from enemy incursions into Calenardhon, and together\n    with the fortress of Helm's Deep to its south protected the Gap of\n    Rohan. After Calenardhon was given to the Éothéod by Cirion, Steward\n    of Gondor and became Rohan, Isengard remained part of Gondor, and\n    the company of Aglarond removed to the northern fortress, although\n    the rest of Gondor almost forgot about it. The small guard\n    intermarried much with the Dunlendings , until the place became a\n    Dunlending fortress in all but name. Orthanc, however, remained\n    closed, as the Steward of Gondor still held the keys. Isengard soon\n    came all but deserted.\n-   Durthang, the largest fortress in Mordor, originally built to guard\n    the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow)..\n-   Erech, a town of Gondor that was abandoned by the end of the Third\n    Age. To the north lay the Paths of the Dead.\n-   Minas Ithil, a city founded by Isildur that was originally the\n    sister city of Minas Anor. Located in an upland valley at the feet\n    of the Mountains of Shadow, it was built as a fortress city to\n    defend Gondor from Sauron in Mordor. It was later conquered by\n    the Nazgûl and renamed Minas Morgul.\n-   Tharbad, a city on both sides of the river Greyflood, (at one time\n    held by Gondor in the south and Arnor in the north) but abandoned as\n    Gondor's borders recessed through Enedwaith to the Isen, and later\n    ruined.\n-   Tower of Cirith Ungol, a Tower Fortress in western Mordor built by\n    Gondor to guard the pass of Cirith Ungol from any evil creature\n    trying to enter -or leave- Mordor. The Great Plague wiped out the\n    garrison located here, so it was easily captured when Sauron's\n    minions re-entered Mordor.\n-   Towers of the Teeth, two towers situated on either side of the Black\n    Gate. The two towers, called Carchost and Narchost, that stand on\n    either side of Cirith Gorgor, the Haunted Pass, which lies between\n    the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow), and the Ash\n    Mountains. Originally built by Men of Gondor following the downfall\n    of Sauron at the end of the Second Age, the Towers of the Teeth were\n    eventually taken over by the servants of the Dark Lord. They were\n    then repaired and fortified and were incorporated into the defenses\n    of the pass and gate.\n-   Umbar, the far southern harbour which was lost and reclaimed several\n    times, in the end being the home of Black Númenóreans, the Corsairs\n    of Umbar.\n",

    "page_id": "240",
    "text": "MINAS TIRITH  (IPA:\n) was the capital of Gondor in the Third Age and the Fourth Age of\nMiddle-earth. Originally known as MINAS ANOR, the “Tower of the Setting\nSun”, it replaced the city Osgiliath as the new capital and stockade of\nGondor.\n\nWhen the Enemy began to take shape again, Minas Anor was renamed Minas\nTirith, the “Tower of Guard.” The city was also called THE WHITE CITY,\nas the courtyard in the front of the city's Citadel contained the White\nTree. Many important events took place in and in front of the city, such\nas the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the healing of Éowyn by Aragorn\nafter the battle, and the coronation of Aragorn II Elessar.\n\n\nLayout\n\nMinas Tirith was surrounded by the Rammas Echor, a large ringwall\nencircling the city and the Pelennor Fields. This wall was built after\nMinas Ithil fell and was renamed Minas Morgul. It was repaired by\nEcthelion II during the time of the War of the Ring, but it had not the\nstrength to defend the city from the Dark Lord Sauron's legions of\nUruk-hai from Mordor. The city itself lay on a hill beneath Mount\nMindolluin, which rose above the city's citadel, by a length of a couple\nof thousand feet. Mount Mindolluin was where Aragorn found the seedling\nof the White Tree. \n\nThe city was divided into seven one-hundred-foot high levels, each\nsurrounded by white walls, except the first walls which had the same\nkind of black stone as Orthanc as a face. The gates connecting the\nlevels did not lay behind one another in a line, but faced in different\ndirections. A spur of rock, whose summit was level with the city's\nuppermost tier, jutted out from the front of the city in an easterly\ndirection, dividing all but the first level into two. Each level was\nscattered with many alleys, narrow passageways, and full-fledged houses\n(which were probably quite rare in the city). On the sixth level were\nlocated the Houses of Healing, surrounded by pleasant gardens. Finally,\nwithin the seventh wall, was the Citadel of Minas Tirith, with the White\nTower of Ecthelion - three hundred feet high, so that its apex was one\nthousand feet above the plain.\n\nLevels\n\n\n\nThe First Level of Minas Tirith was the lowest level of Minas Tirith\nwhere was the Main gate.\n\nDuring the Siege of Minas Tirith, Uruk-hai cast fire into the First\nLevel, burning many buildings and causing general havoc to many of the\ndefenders. Later on, the Main Gate was breached when Grond was finally\nused against it, and the soldiers of Gondor and Uruk-hai clashed in the\nstreets of the First Circle but Aragorn ordered a retreat and then made\ntheir way up.\n\n\nHistory\n\nMinas Tirith (as Minas Anor) was built in SA 3320. King Ostoher rebuilt\nthe city in TA 420, and, gradually, it became more important than\nOsgiliath, the original capital, which in later years fell into ruin.\nKing Tarondor finally moved the King's House to the city in TA 1640,\nthereby making it the official capital of the kingdom of Gondor. In the\nyear TA 2002, the White City's companion tower Minas Ithil (the “Tower\nof the Moon”) on the borders of Mordor was captured by the Ringwraiths\nand renamed Minas Morgul (the “Tower of Sorcery”). Minas Anor was then\nrenamed Minas Tirith, meaning the “Tower of Guard”, to indicate that,\nsince the fall of Minas Ithil, Minas Tirith was the only thing that\ndefended Gondor and all the other lands around and behind it against the\ndarkness from Mordor. The Rammas Echor, the great wall encircling the\nrich farmlands and suburbs of the City, was built at this time.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nMinas Tirith only has Gondorian soldiers while the civilians dwell in\nOsgiliath with several Gondorian soldiers. After the Uruk-hai attacked\nand overran Osgiliath a thousand soldiers were killed while the\nremaining thousand soldiers fled to Minas Tirith while the civilians\nwere evacuated to Rohan. The remaining gondorian soldiers entered\nOsgiliath and once the uruk-hai were slain the civilians departed from\nRohan and returned to Osgiliath.\n\nSiege of Minas Tirith\n\nMinas Tirith was besieged by the armies of Mordor, under the Great\nDarkness generated by Sauron's power. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields\ntook place on March 15, 3019 in the fields surrounding the city. It was\na very large battle. Theoden, the King of Rohan was killed during this\nbattle by the Witch-king of Angmar. At about the same time, the\nWitch-king was destroyed by Éowyn, lady of Rohan, who was severely\nwounded in the process. It was also there that Gandalf took command of\nthe City's defenses from the Ruling Steward Denethor after he fell to\ndespair. Aragorn later arrived at the hour of need with Gondor's Army of\nthe South which he had liberated from defending the port city of\nPelargir, turning the tide of battle in favor of the Free Peoples. After\nthe battle, the stench of death was heavy in Minas Tirith's air, and the\nPelennor Fields lay strewn with bodies.\n\nFourth Age\n\nOn 1 May 3019, the Crowning of King Elessar took place on the plain\noutside Minas Tirith. After his coronation, he entered the city as the\nKing of Gondor, as he was destined to become from the start of his\nlifetime. With his coronation, King Elessar refounded the line of the\nKings of Gondor, and as he was also the King of the Kingdom of Arnor,\nMinas Tirith became Capital of the Reunited Kingdom.\n\nMinas Tirith was repaired by its new king (who grew plants inside of its\nwalls to add to its luster and beauty) and by the Dwarves of Glittering\nCaves, particularly Gimli, who built a new gate for the city (made of\nmithril and steel) and altogether fixed the layout of the city as well.\nMinas Tirith was said to have been made even more beautiful than when it\nwas at the time of its founding. The city is known to have stood firm\nand strong well into the Fourth Age because of these two renovations.\n\nIn _The Silmarillion_, as Of The Ring Of Power And The Third Age says,\nafter War of the Ring, the city is referred to as Minas Anor again after\nthe overthrow of Sauron and the destruction of Barad-dûr.\n",

Tolkien that were\nnever completed during his lifetime, but were edited and concluded by\nhis son Christopher Tolkien and published in 1980.\n\n\nPublication and edition\n\nUnlike _The Silmarillion_, in which the narrative fragments were\nmodified to connect into a consistent and coherent work, the _Unfinished\nTales_ are presented as Tolkien left them, with little more than names\nchanged (the author having had a confusing habit of trying out different\nnames for a character while writing a draft). Thus some of these are\nincomplete stories, while others are collections of “factual”\ninformation about Middle-earth. Each tale is followed by a long series\nof Christopher's notes explaining inconsistencies and obscure points.\n\nAs with _The Silmarillion_, Christopher Tolkien edited and published\n_Unfinished Tales_ before he had finished his study of the materials in\nhis father's archive. Despite its shortcomings in editorial consistency,\n_Unfinished Tales_ does provide more detailed information about\ncharacters, events and places mentioned only briefly in _The Lord of the\nRings_. Versions of such tales including the origins of Gandalf and the\nWizards, the death of Isildur and the loss of the One Ring in the\nGladden Fields, and the founding of the kingdom of Rohan help expand\nknowledge about Middle-earth.\n\nOf particular note is the tale of Tar-Aldarion and Erendis (chapter two\nof Part Two), the only known story of Númenor before its fall. A map of\nNúmenor is also included in the book.\n\nThe _Unfinished Tales_ had commercial success, demonstrating that the\ndemand for Tolkien's stories several years after his death was not only\nstill present, it was actually growing. Considering this, Christopher\nTolkien began to embark upon the more ambitious twelve-volume work\nentitled _The History of Middle-earth_ which encompassed nearly the\nentire corpus of Tolkien's writings about Middle-earth.\n\n\nContents\n\nPart One: The First Age:\n\n-   “Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin”\n-   “Narn i Chîn Húrin (The Tale of the Children of Húrin)”\n\nPart Two: The Second Age:\n\n-   “A Description of the Island of Númenor”\n-   “Aldarion and Erendis: The Mariner's Wife”\n-   “The Line of Elros: Kings of Númenor”\n-   “The History of Galadriel and Celeborn”\n\nPart Three: The Third Age:\n\n-   “The Disaster of the Gladden Fields”\n-   “Cirion and Eorl and the Friendship of Gondor and Rohan”\n-   “The Quest of Erebor”\n-   “The Hunt for the Ring”\n-   “The Battles of the Fords of Isen”\n\nPart Four\n\n-   “The Drúedain”\n-   “The Istari”\n-   “The Palantíri”"

    "text": "THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH (abbreviated sometimes\nas HOME, and here as THOME) is a 13-volume series of books that collects\nand analyses material relating to Middle-earth, twelve of which were\ncompiled and edited by the son of J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien.\n\nMost of the content consists of earlier versions of already published\nworks by Tolkien, while other portions are completely new material.\nThese books are extremely detailed, to the point of documenting scraps\nof paper (of J.R.R. Tolkien's) that had been erased multiple times with\nmany footnotes. Christopher Tolkien thoroughly documents the history of\nthe writing of the Middle-earth stories, with as much detail as his\nfather documented the fictional history of Middle-earth itself.\n\nThe first two books introduce readers to _The Book of Lost Tales_, a\nmythology for England from which Tolkien drew ideas that eventually\nbecame the 'Silmarillion' mythology. The next three books follow the\nhistory of the emerging early mythology usually known as _The\nSilmarillion_. The discussion of the published book is deferred until\nbook ten. Books six through nine discuss the development of _The Lord of\nthe Rings_, book nine's second half discussing the Númenor story (the\nfirst versions of which were covered in Book Five). Book ten and eleven\ndiscuss the _Annals of Beleriand_ and _Annals of Aman_, which works were\ndeveloped together with the _Silmarillion_ tradition and which also\nserved as source material for the published Silmarillion.

    "text": "LINDON was a Elven Kingdom founded by Gil-galad at the beginning of the\nSecond Age. It was the longest-standing Eldarin Kingdom in the history\nof Middle-earth, and the mightiest throughout the Second Age. It was\nruled by its founder, Gil-galad, the High King of the Ñoldor, who,\nduring that age, was the strongest and most powerful enemy of Sauron in\nMiddle-earth.\n\nThe realm endured through the Third Age, though diminished, and was the\nsite of the Grey Havens, where the Elves, as well as the Ring-bearers,\nsailed to the Undying Lands.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nLindon was located in what remained of Ossiriand; the Land of Seven\nRivers and all that was left of the peninsula of Beleriand after the War\nof Wrath. The mountains, partially sunk in the ruin of Beleriand,\nformed a portion of the realm's east border. The realm reached as far\nnorth over the mountains as the Little Lune. North of that boundary was\nwhat remained of the Dwarf kingdom of Belegost. After the ruin of\nBeleriand, Gil-Galad founded the realm of Lindon, which encompassed all\nthe land west of the Blue Mountains and east of the sea in the North of\nMiddle-earth. The Gulf of Lune broke the realm of Lindon into Forlindon\nand Harlindon. The Grey Havens lay at the mouth of the river Lune.\nThrough a break in the Blue Mountains, the land of Eriador lay to the\neast, and farther southeast laid the Shire. Eastward also lay the\nKingdom of Eregion, at the feet of the Misty Mountains, which was also\nruled by Gil-Galad under the lordship of Celebrimbor. Towards the\nend of the Second Age, the realm of Arnor was established by Elendil to\nthe northeast of Lindon.\n\nThe lands of Lindon were said to be lush and green, with thick forests\nlining the foothills of the Blue Mountains. The havens of the elves were\nfound along the Gulf of Lune, where the land became rocky yet lush along\nthe coast. Tolkien stated that Lindon was Elven country “where no Man\ndwells”. It was the last realm that was fair and free. It also had a\nmildly tempered climate, with mild winters and mild summers.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the Second Age\n\n_Lindon_ was another name for the Ossiriand in East Beleriand, where the\nLaiquendi dwelt.\n\nSecond Age\n\nAfter the War of Wrath, those Elves who had sought refuge on the coast\nof the sea at the mouths of the river Sirion removed into the land that\nwas left in the northwest of Middle-earth. They, led by Gil-Galad,\nestablished the realm of Lindon in SA 1. In the North at Forlindon\nGil-galad ruled a majority of Noldorin Elves. In southern Harlindon,\nCeleborn ruled a fiefdom of many Sindar and the remaining Green Elves of\nBeleriand under Gil-Galad. He did not rule under Gil-galad for long,\nthough, eventually removing to the shores of Lake Nenuial with his wife,\nGaladriel. At the Grey Havens Círdan was the lord of many shipbuilders\nof the Teleri who survived the ruin of the First Age. The Elves believed\nnow that the threat of Morgoth was removed, and Lindon became a fair\nkingdom. Gil-galad and the Elves of Lindon had a very strong friendship\nwith Númenor and its kings before the Darkening of Númenor.\n\nEarly in the sixth century of the Second Age, the first ships of Númenor\nreturned to Middle-earth. Vëantur, father-in-law of Tar-Meneldur, led\nthe first expedition. Later he returned with his grandson and heir to\nthe throne, Aldarion, and the Númenoreans were well liked by Gil-galad\nand his people. Tar-Aldarion continued his voyages to Lindon throughout\nhis reign as the sixth King of Númenor, and Gil-galad and Círdan taught\nmuch to the mariners of Númenor. Gil-galad befriended Aldarion and gave\nhim and his father, Tar-Meneldur, many gifts. After the reign of\nAldarion, Númenor was less active in the affairs of Lindon for many\nhundred years, though friendship remained.\n\nIn the twelfth century, Sauron attempted to infiltrate Lindon disguised\nas 'Annatar', the Lord of Gifts. His strength now on the mend after\nMorgoth's defeat, Sauron purposed to corrupt the strongest of all the\nremaining Elf-kingdoms. Gil-galad denied him, and so did Elrond, who\ndwelt then with the King in Forlindon. Though they did not know\nAnnatar's true identity at the time, the wise king of Lindon foresaw\nevil in Annatar. Sauron then turned his attention to Eregion, where he\nsucceeded in befriending the Noldorin smiths under Celebrimbor who\nworked there.\n\n\n\nAfter Sauron forged the One Ring at the beginning of the sixth century,\nhe declared war on the Elf-kingdoms to capture the Rings of Power they\nhad hidden from him. Gil-galad sent a small army led by Elrond east to\nthe aid of Eregion. There he joined with Celeborn, but Sauron's forces\ndefeated the combined force. His army ravaged Eregion and the rest of\nEriador, and came to the borders of Lindon. There, Gil-galad's forces\ndug in against the forces of Sauron, and were strengthened by a great\nfleet sent from Númenor by Tar-Minastir, the King of Númenor, under his\nson and heir Ciryatan. With the aid of the Númenoreans, participating in\ntheir first war upon Middle-Earth, Lindon was freed and Sauron's forces\noverthrown. Sauron returned to Mordor and focused his attention now on\nruining Númenor.\n\nIn the year SA 3319 of the Second Age, Númenor was destroyed, and\nElendil and sons and his remnant of Faithful Númenoreans landed on the\ncoast of Middle-earth. Elendil established the Realms in Exile which\nwere the North-Kingdom of Arnor and the South-Kingdom of Gondor. He\nbecame close friends and ally with Gil-galad, and they pledged support\nto one another against the preparing blow of Sauron, who had risen to\npower once again after fleeing the ruin of Númenor.\n\nThe War of the Last Alliance began in SA 3434, and the Elves of Lindon\nformed a large part of the backbone of the Elven armies. Elendil's\nNúmenorean refugees, along with Dúnedain who had removed to Middle-Earth\nbefore the destruction of Númenor, marched alongside the host of\nGil-galad, and eventually they laid siege to the Dark Tower. Sauron\nhimself then came to battle, and fought Gil-galad and Elendil. The two\nkings defeated him but died in the process. Then, Isildur son of Elendil\ncut the ring from Sauron's hand, and he was for a time defeated.\n\nThird Age\n\nAfter the death of Gil-galad, the lordship of Lindon passed to Círdan;\nand the line of Noldorin kings in Middle-Earth came to an end. The\npopulation of Lindon had been reduced by the long and bloody war with\nSauron. With the loss of their king, many of the Noldor and Sindar left\nfor Valinor. Following the war, many Elves began to come to the Grey\nHavens and sail to Valinor, further depleting Lindon's population.\nCírdan continued his shipbuilding, and had much work constructing the\nvessels to carry the Elves west. However, the kingdom began to dwindle\nas the ships continued to sail.\n\nThe Witch-king of Angmar attacked the Kingdom of Arnor in the thirteenth\ncentury of the Third Age. Lindon lent what aid it could to the Dúnedain,\nbut after many years, the North-Kingdom was overthrown. The Dúnedain\nwent into exile, and the kingdom of Lindon shrank rapidly into a safe\nhaven for the Elves of Middle-earth. By the time of the War of the Ring,\nit was a shadow of its former glory, with only Grey Havens seeing\nregular traffic and activity. After Sauron's defeat, the last Elves\nbegan to sail for Valinor, and Círdan remained there well into the\nFourth Age, awaiting the last ship to sail west himself.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _LINDON_ means “Land of the Singers”, from the Quenya term\n_lin_ or _lind_ (“to sing, make musical sound”) and _-on_, which\nis a common suffix for regions.",

Examples are the name of the\ntower at Dol Amroth and the names of the Seven Rivers of Gondor. There\nis some dispute about its canonical status since the information\npresented about the secondary world is considered only as folklore among\nthe Hobbits.\n\n_Tom Bombadil_ can best be seen as a small, poetic venture into\nTolkien's imagination."

    "text": "The WHITE MOUNTAINS or ERED NIMRAIS was a mountain range in\nMiddle-earth that lay east-to-west across the length of Gondor.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe mountains were named after the glaciers of their highest peaks. The\nrange lay mostly East-West, but also had a northern section, which was\nseparated from the main line of the Misty Mountains by the Gap of Rohan.\nEven at the southern latitude of Gondor and Rohan, the White Mountains\nbore snow even in summer, suggesting they were extremely high. The range\nhad no passes. The Paths of the Dead passed under it, but only the most\ncourageous (or foolhardy) ever ventured that route. The White Mountains\nformed the northern boundary of Gondor and the southern boundary of\nRohan except in their easternmost provinces, where Gondor's province of\nAnorien lay to the north of the mountains.\n\nBecause of their always bearing snow at their highest peaks, the White\nMountains must have been at least 4800 meters (16'000 feet) above sea\nlevel, with occasional peaks probably in excess of 5500 meters. They\nwere, however, not as high as the Misty Mountains.\n\nIts notable peaks included _Irensaga_ “Iron Saw” and _Starkhorn_.\nBetween these two lay the _Dwimorberg_, entrance to the Paths of the\nDead.\n\nAt the eastern end, the city of Minas Tirith was carved into\n_Mindolluin_ mountain. The Warning beacons of Gondor were placed on top\nof seven peaks in the range: _Amon Dîn_, _Eilenach_, _Nardol_, _Erelas_,\n_Min-Rimmon_, _Calenhad_ and _Halifirien_.\n\nSeveral rivers raised in the White Mountains, among them: the Adorn (a\ntributary of Isen), and the Snowbourn and Mering Stream (tributaries of\nthe Entwash); and, on the south side, the Erui (a tributary of Anduin),\nthe Ringló and its tributary Ciril (which together with the Morthond all\nentered the Bay of Belfalas at Edhellond near Dol Amroth), the Lefnui of\nthe Anfalas, and the Five Rivers of Lebennin.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe natives to the White Mountains were Drúedain who inhabited this\nregion in the Second Age. The only remnants of the Druedain's presence\nin this mountain range were their statues called the _Púkel-men_.\nSometime thereafter, evil men related to the Dunlendings drove the\nDrúedain out. Some of these men swore allegiance to Isildur, but\nbetrayed him and were cursed into the Army of the Dead. Aragorn,\nLegolas, and Gimli followed the Paths of the Dead in year 3019 of the\nThird Age and convinced the army to fight for Gondor in the War of the\nRing. After they did so, Aragorn released the Army of the Dead, for they\nhad fulfilled their oath. After and perhaps before the War of the Ring\nDwarves settled in the White Mountain, where they could have better\ncontact with their allies.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ERED NIMRAIS_ is a Sindarin name: _Ered_ ('Mountains') and _Nimrais_\n('White peaks')",

The three\npeaks that were part of Khazad-dûm were Caradhras (Redhorn), Celebdil\n(Silvertine) and Fanuidhol (Cloudyhead). Inside Celebdil, the Dwarves\nbuilt the Endless Stair, from the foundations of the mountain to the top\nof it. The southernmost peak of the Misty Mountains was Methedras,\nmeaning “the Last Peak”.\n\nRoutes through the Misty Mountains\n\nThe most important passes were the High Pass and the Redhorn Pass. There\nwas also a pass at the source of the Gladden river.\n\nRoutes around the Misty Mountains\n\nThe Gap of Rohan was the valley (probably of the River Isen) between the\nsouthernmost peaks of the Misty Mountains and the northernmost of the\nWhite Mountains. There may have been a gap between Mount Gundabad in the\nMisty Mountains and the westernmost extremity of the Grey Mountains,\nthough published maps differ on this point. \n\nInhabitants\n\nUnder the Misty Mountains were the former Dwarf realm of Khazad-dum, and\nthe “Goblin-town” in which Bilbo Baggins stumbled across the One Ring,\nwhich had been in the possession of the creature Gollum, who also dwelt\nthere himself on the eastern side. Rivendell was hidden in the foothills\nof the Misty Mountains at the western end of the High Pass.\n\nCarn Dûm, where the Witch-King of Angmar resided for several centuries\nin the Third Age, lay between a western spur of the northern extreme of\nthe range, known as the Mountains of Angmar. Mount Gundabad, the largest\nGoblin dwelling in the Misty Mountains, was located south-east of\nAngmar.\n\nIsengard lay centered around the Tower of Orthanc in Nan Curunír, the\nvalley between the arms of Methedras, which was the southernmost peak of\nthe Misty Mountains. The “stone-giants” also inhabited this mountain\nrange, as told in _The Hobbit_.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Misty Mountains were created by Melkor during the Time of the Trees,\nwho wanted to make it difficult for Oromë, who often rode across\nMiddle-earth hunting his fell beasts, to pass.\n\nYears of the Trees\n\nThe Dwarves of Durin awoke under Mount Gundabad and later established\nthe caves of Khazad-dûm. Later, when the Elves on their Great Journey to\nValinor looked upon their terrible height a portion of the Teleri, later\nknown as the Nandor grew afraid and turned south down the Great River.\nThousands of years later, the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth and\nestablished great realms in the Beleriand and in the highlands, but they\nnever crossed the mountains or established realms within them.\n\nFirst and Second Ages\n\nOver three-hundred years into the First Age, the tribes of Men crossed\nthe Misty Mountains and began migrating into the Beleriand, first the\nEdain and then later the Easterlings or Swarthy Men. After the defeat of\nMorgoth, the surviving orcs and a Balrog came to live there and would\nremain a problem for over six-thousand years. The Easterling men who\nfought with Morgoth crossed the mountains and began living east of the\nWilderland in Rhûn. The Great Eagles also began living here in a place\nknown as the Eagles Eyrie.\n\nThe great Dwarven realm of Khazad-dûm beneath the Misty Mountains\nthrived as good relations with the Ñoldor of Eregion were established,\nuntil Sauron invaded Eriador from Mordor and the east destroying Eregion\nand ravaging the lands beyond. The dwarves survived by shutting\nthemselves in Khazad-dûm behind the Doors of Durin.\n\nThird Age\n\nIn TA 1980, the great Dwarven realm of Khazad-dûm came to an end when\nthe Dwarves unearthed a Balrog which led to its desertion by TA 1981,\nafter which it was known as Moria (literally, “black chasm”). Slowly,\nthe Misty Mountains became increasingly perilous and dangerous to\ntravelers as Goblins and other creatures came to dwell under there.\n\nAlmost a thousand years later, the thirteen Dwarves, Gandalf, and Bilbo\nBaggins used the High Pass to cross the Misty Mountains during the Quest\nfor the Lonely Mountain, and were captured by Goblins whilst crossing.\nUnder the mountains, the Great Goblin was slain, and Bilbo found the One\nRing.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring tried to cross the Redhorn Pass (after\nrejecting the High Pass leading to Rhovanion as being watched by the\nEnemy, and the Gap of Rohan as taking the Fellowship too close to\nIsengard), but a blizzard forced it to go under the mountain instead of\nover it. They faced a Balrog that dwelt in the deserted realm of\nKhazad-dûm. Gandalf slew the Balrog by casting it down from Zirakzigil,\nbut it had worn his life already, and on that high ground he lay until\nGwaihir bore him to Lothlorien.",

Each company of soldiers\nwas guided by a Wild Man, who also sent out scouts to keep their\nmovements secret. Movement through the forest keep the army from being\nspotted by the enemy.\n\nIn the Fourth Age, King Aragorn II Elessar declared that the men of the\nforest would have the land to themselves because of their help during\nthe war."

    "text": "DUNLAND was the land of the wild men, or 'Dunlendings'. _Dunland_ means\n_Hill Land_ in the language of neighboring Rohan, whose people named it\nafter arriving in nearby Calenardhon in the later Third Age.\n\n\nInhabitants\n\nDunland was inhabited by the Dunlendings, Men who were mostly bearded\nand had dirty faces, and long matted hair. They wore clothes of leather\nand animal skin and carried weapons that were simple but effective for\ntheir purpose. They usually fought with clubs and pitchforks, and at\ntimes they carried torches to act as lights at night and to burn\nbuildings by day. The buildings that Dunlendings lived and worked in\nwere crude shacks of wood and animal skin that were often sabotaged by\nWargs and sometimes the Rohirrim.\n\nThe vernacular of this land's inhabitants, including possibly the\nStoors, was Dunlendish.\n\nAncestors of the Dunlendings inhabited the forested regions of\nMiddle-earth on either side of the Gwathló in the early Second Age; thus\nthe early Númenóreans called them _Gwaithuirim_. They spoke a language\nrelated to that of the Second House of Men, the Haladin, rather than the\nvastly different Bëorian-Marachian tongue which stood at the base of\nAdûnaic, and this lack of mutual understanding led to outright\nhostility. The Númenóreans greedily harvested _Gwaithuirim_ forests for\ntimber, and after much war and bloodshed, the _Gwaithuirim_ from south\nof the Gwathló fled east to the Hithaeglir while others scattered to the\ncape of Eryn Vorn and the White Mountains.\n\nAt the end of the Second Age, the land north of the Gwathló and south of\nthe Baranduin was named Minhiriath “Land between the Rivers”, although\nthe land south of Minhiriath remained unnamed. Its inhabitants were\nlargely ignored despite the fact that the Gondor colonial city of\nTharbad grew up on the Gwathló west of the Misty Mountain hillfolk who\nhad been _Gwaithuirim_ long before. It was not until Gondor abandoned\nthis city in TA 2050 that the people and their land were renamed: both\nbecame known as Enedwaith “Middle-Folk, Middle Region”, because they\nowed no allegiance to the North or South Kingdom.\n\nThe Hillfolk of the Hithaeglir kept their hatred of the descendants of\nNúmenor (unlike those of Eryn Vorn and the White Mountains, who\nnevertheless remained uncooperative). The Dead Men of Dunharrow who\nbetrayed Isildur were descended from _Gwaithurim_.\n\nIn T.A. 2770, Smaug the Dragon destroyed the Kingdom under the Mountain.\nDwarves fleeing from this disaster settled in Dunland, from\nwhere Thrór departed when he and his companion Nár journeyed\nto Moria in T.A. 2790. After the Battle of Azanulbizar, provoked by\nthe Orcs' brutal slaying of Thrór, Thráin II and Thorin led the remnants\nof their followers back to Dunland but soon left (to eventually settle\nin the Blue Mountains).\n\nWhen Gondor decided to give the depopulated province of Calenardhon to\nthe numerous people of Éothéod in TA 2510, the Hillfolk of the\nHithaeglir felt threatened by these _Forgoil_ “Strawheads” (a demeaning\nreference to the blonde hair of the refugees from Calenardhon). The\nHillfolk had slowly colonised Calenardhon during the dwindling of the\nDúnedain and had already reclaimed all the land between the Adorn and\nIsen. Still, open war was not waged until the reign of Helm Hammerhand\n(TA 2741 - TA 2759). Freca, the Lord of the Hillmen (whom the Rohirrim\nnow called Dunlendings) tried to get the throne of Rohan for himself by\npetitioning for the marriage of his son Wulf to the daughter of Helm.\nThe Hill-men leader Freca was killed and Wulf led the Dunlendings into\nopen war with Rohan. They unsuccessfully besieged the Hornburg during\nthe Long Winter of TA 2758 - TA 2759. Wulf did take Edoras and killed\nHaleth, the son of Helm, in front of the golden hall of Meduseld.\nNonetheless, Helm's nephew Fréalaf held out against the Dunlendings in\nthe refuge of Dunharrow. He recaptured Edoras at the end of the Long\nWinter and killed Wulf personally. The Dunlendings were driven out of\nRohan, and Fréalaf succeeded the deceased Helm Hammerhand.\n\nGuarding the Gap of Rohan was the fortress of Isengard, where a\nhereditary guard watched for Gondor. However, by the time of the Steward\nof Gondor Beren, these guards had mixed with Dunlendings, and it had\nbecome hostile to Gondor. To remedy this situation, Beren gave Saruman\nthe keys to Orthanc to guard Isengard for Gondor.\n\nSaruman used the historical hostility against outlanders to tempt the\nDunlendings into supporting him during the War of the Ring. In The Two\nTowers extended edition, the Dunlending warlord is shown giving a\nblood-oath to Saruman.\n\nAfter the battle at Helm's Deep, the Rohirrim allowed the surviving\nDunlendings to return to their homes. The Rohirrim required that all\nhostilities cease and that the Dunlendings again retreat behind the\nIsen.\n\n\nNearby locations\n\n-   North: Galanduin River\n-   East: Misty Mountains\n-   South: Isengard\n-   West: Enedwaith\n",

She bore him a son Eldacar, but many of the people\nof Gondor of Númenórean blood were angered by this mixing of blood of\nMiddle Men and Númenóreans, and the coastal provinces rebelled when\nValacar grew old.\n\n\nCivil War\n\nWhen in TA 1432 Eldacar succeeded his father the unrest grew into open\nrebellion, as many people saw Eldacar as a half-breed who had no right\nto rule. The chief of them was his distant relative Castamir the\nUsurper, Lord of Ships, who in TA 1437 usurped the throne, forcing\nEldacar into exile. Castamir was supported by the people of the realm of\nUmbar, who sought revenge against Gondor. During the rebellion Osgiliath\nwas burned, and the great Dome of Stars was lost, together with its\nPalantír. Castamir also murdered Eldacar's son and heir Ornendil.\nEldacar fled to Rhovanion, and Castamir ruled in his stead.\n\nA full decade later, in TA 1447, Eldacar returned with Rhovanion troops;\nat the same time a rebellion against Castamir's cruel rule took place.\nEldacar managed to kill Castamir at the Battle of Erui, but Castamir's\nsons and many of their supporters fled south to Umbar. Eldacar could not\nfollow them, as the fleet was under Castamir's control.\n\nNot only did Gondor lose the city of Umbar for four centuries and gain a\nnew enemy in the Corsairs of Umbar, descendants of Castamir's sons, but\nalso many of the Númenóreans of purest blood were killed during the\ncivil war, leaving Gondor weakened.\n\nThe Kin-strife was, along with the Great Plague and sheer laziness one\nof the chief reasons for the abandonment of the fortresses in and\nsurrounding Mordor."

Angmar's armies had taken Fornost, the capital\nof the Dúnedain, and Arvedui, the last King of Arnor, had drowned in the\nIce-Bay of Forochel. A year later, a fleet of ships under Eärnur arrived\nin the Grey Havens and set off toward what was left of the once-great\nnorthern kingdom. With the armies of Gondor came men from Rhovanion,\nelves from Lindon, and the remainder of the Dúnedain (among them\nAranarth, the Prince of Arthedain). According to Shire historians, a\ncompany of archers was also sent to the battle.\n\nThe battle itself did not take place in the city of Fornost, but on the\nplains to the west of the city, near Lake Evendim. The armies of Angmar\nhurried west to meet the assault, and seeing this, the cavalry of Gondor\nrode north into the Hills of Evendim to wait in ambush. As the main part\nof the army of Gondor met the enemy in battle, the Gondor cavalry set\nout from the hills to strike the rear of the army of Angmar. This served\nas the turning point in the battle, and allowed the combined armies of\nthe west to gain the advantage. Realizing that his forces were all but\ncompletely destroyed, the Witch-king of Angmar fled eastward. As he\nfled, an army led by Glorfindel came up out of the south and blocked his\nescape, destroying what was left of his crumbling army; the Witch-king\nhimself was able to escape during the night and fled southward. Though\nthe battle itself had been lost and Angmar utterly destroyed, Sauron was\nextremely pleased with the Witch-King's work, for the destruction of the\nnorthern kingdoms of the Dúnedain was a victory for the Dark Powers\nwhich far exceeded the loss of the Witch-King's realm."

The land was known in part for\nits cold and snowy weather.\n\n\nHistory\n\nLong before the Witch-king came to Angmar, the dwarves had many\nflourishing mines in the region, and halls that were secure and\nprosperous. It was not long before Durin's Folk felt the first assaults\nof Angmar. They fled southward, seeking the safety of their mines in the\nWeather Hills. \n\nThe Witch-king arose in Angmar during the realm of Malvegil of\nArthedain, at some time between TA 1272 and TA 1349. Men became aware of\nthe growing evil in the mountains, but Angmar was still preparing its\npower. No assaults on the Dunedain came until Argeleb I, the son of\nMalvegil, assumed the throne of Arthedain. \n\nIn TA 1356, the sub-realm Rhudaur was forced to invade Arthedain; many\nwere slaughtered including their king, Argeleb I. However, with the help\nof Cardolan's armies, Arthedain maintained a strong line of defense at\nthe foot of the Weather Hills. \n\n\n\nThen in TA 1409, Angmar attacked Cardolan and Rivendell and destroyed\nall the settlements within except Cardolan's capital, the Barrow-downs.\nAmon Sul was razed and burned and the Dunedain were forced to flee\nwestward. Arthedain was now left without any allies to aid it, and so\nbegan a mighty struggle lasting another 500 years.  \n\nHelp came from the Elves of the Grey Havens, Rivendell, and Lorien. The\narmies of Angmar were repelled from Fornost and the North Downs, and\nforced to withdraw to Angmar. The shadow of the North was contained for\na time.  \n\nAfter the Great Plague, which started from the east of Mordor in TA\n1636, the last of Cardolan's people died, allowing Barrow-wights to be\nsent from Angmar into the downs. \n\nDuring the time of TA 1974, Angmar multiplied its forces and launched a\nfinal assault on Arthedain. Subsequently, they took its capital Fornost,\nthereby defeating the last northern kingdom of the Dunedain.\n\nSometime later, Prince Eärnur - thirty-third and last King of Gondor -\narrived to aid Arthedain, but he found he was too late.

The White Tree was also\nthe motif of Gondor's flag.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThis iconic tree was in appearance a tall spacious tree of graceful\nform, white thin unwrinkled bark over white wood. In spring it bore\nnumerous white flowers, but few of these ever fructified; what shape the\nfruit was is never described, nor is it considered to be edible. The\nleaves were laurel-like, dark green above and bright silver beneath. The\nwood when burned gives off a dense, choking, volumnious smoke that forms\na fog capable of burying an entire country in darkness for several days.\n\nIt was fashioned in the image of Telperion, elder of the Two Trees of\nValinor, originally. This image was given to the Elves of Kortirion in\nValinor and named Galathilion. From it a sapling was taken to Tol\nEressëa, named Celeborn. This in turn sired the tree Nimloth of Númenor,\nfelled by Sauron and burned on the altars.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFirst White Tree\n\nThe first White Tree of Gondor came from a fruit that Isildur, at great\npersonal risk, managed to steal from Nimloth the Fair, the White Tree of\nNúmenor, before that one was destroyed at Sauron's insistence. He\nsuffered many wounds at this mission, and he came near death, but when\nthe first leaf opened in the spring, Isildur was healed of his wounds.\n\nThis sapling was brought to Middle-earth on Isildur's ship, and it was\neventually planted in Minas Ithil before the house of Isildur. But when\nSauron returned to Middle-earth, he launched a sudden attack that\ncaptured Minas Ithil, and he destroyed the White Tree. Isildur escaped\ntaking with him again a sapling.\n\nSecond White Tree\n\nIn the Year 2 of the Third Age, Isildur plants the seedling of the White\nTree in Minas Anor.\n\nThis White Tree lasts until TA 1636, when the Great Plague hits Gondor,\nkilling among many others King Telemnar and his children.\n\nThird White Tree\n\nA third sapling is planted in TA 1640 by King Tarondor. This one lasts\nuntil the year 2852 and the death of the Ruling Steward Belecthor II.\n\nAt this time no seedling of the tree could be found. As a result it was\nleft standing after its death.\n\nFourth White Tree\n\nWhen Aragorn becomes king he discovers (with Gandalf's help) a sapling\nof the White Tree upon the slopes of Mindolluin, high above the city,\nwhich he reverently plants in its place. The dead tree is removed from\nthe court but is placed in the Tombs of the Kings with all the honour\nthat would normally be accorded a fallen monarch. In June of TA 3019 the\nsapling blooms.\n"

    "text": "The EDAIN (sing. ADAN) also known as ATANATÁRI, FATHERS OF MEN, and_'\nThree Houses of Men_', are a group of Men that came to the Beleriand\nfrom the Far East during the First Age.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the early fourth century of the First Age the Edain, drawn towards\nthe Light of the West, came into Beleriand where they befriended the\nelves, entered their service, received land and title for that service,\nand fought valiantly in the Battles of Beleriand. Some, however,\nremained in Estolad or fled south or east from the power of Dark Lord\nMorgoth, and passed from history until the Third Age. Despite their\nmighty heroes, the Edain were decimated by the hordes of Morgoth, but\none of their numbers, Eärendil of the House of Hador, sailed to Aman and\nobtained from the Valar the aid by which Morgoth was defeated in the\nLast Battle. The remnant of the Edain, now increased in body and mind by\nEönwë, then sailed to Númenor and became known as Númenóreans and later\nthe Dúnedain who came to live in Middle-earth in the Realms in Exile\nafter the Fall of Númenor.\n\n\nThree Houses of Man\n\nThey were divided into three tribes, or “Houses”:\n\n1.) The HOUSE OF BËOR: they were dark-haired and stoutly built, and most\nresembled the Ñoldor of all Elves. They were first discovered by Finrod\nFelagund, Lord of Nargothrond, and under his guidance later made their\nway to the lands of the Ñoldorin lord Amrod, in a place later known as\nEstolad, the Encampment. They remained loyal to the House of Finarfin,\nand later settled in the lands of Dorthonion.\n\n2.) The Second House, later known as the HALADIN or the HOUSE OF HALETH:\nThey were a reclusive folk, dark-haired but smaller in stature than the\nBëorians. They usually kept separate from the other Men, and were later\ngranted permission to settle in the Forest of Brethil, part of Doriath.\nThey mostly kept out of the wars.\n\n3.) The HOUSE OF MARACH, later best known as the HOUSE OF HADOR: They\nwere originally led by Marach but later took the name of Hador in honor\nof him. Tall and golden-haired, they most resembled the Vanyar of the\nelves. They were a very numerous and war-like tribe, and the Green Elves\nof Ossiriand feared them. They first settled in Estolad, then in the\nsouthern parts of Ered Wethrin (Mountains of Shadow), and then later in\nDor-lómin. They were loyal to Fingolfin.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nThe Edain were tall, fair, and strong; their spirits were noble, they\nwere fierce in war, and they shunned all dealings with evil. In\nBeleriand the Edain loved the Eldar, from whom they learned much wisdom,\nand they were further ennobled by the two marriages of Elda and Adan:\nBeren and Lúthien and Tuor and Idril. The lifespan of the Edain before\nthey entered Beleriand was probably about 70 years; in Beleriand, it was\nlengthened to 90, but few of the Edain lived to old age in peace.\n\n\nLanguage\n\nThe language of the Edain (at least those of the First and Third Houses)\nwas related to Adûnaic, but in Beleriand, most of the Edain spoke\nSindarin, and so the tongue of the Haladin was alien to them.\n\n\nFate of the Edain\n\nThe House of Bëor was nearly wiped out by Morgoth, and the remainder of\nits people merged with the Hadorians and became the Númenóreans. It\nwould seem that the Haladin of Beleriand were completely wiped out, or\nat least disappeared as a separate people.\n\nWhen they returned as Númenóreans to Middle-earth in the Second Age,\nthey encountered many men who were obviously related to the Atani: they\nclassified these men as _Middle Men_, and established friendly relations\nwith them. Examples are the Rohirrim, the Men of Dale, and the\nBreelanders.\n\nOther men, such as the Dunlendings, were not recognised as Middle Men\nbecause they were related to the Haladin rather than Bëorians or\nMarachians, and they were hostile to Númenor.\n\nA fourth kind of men came with the Second House, and called themselves\n_Drughu_. This name was adopted in Sindarin as _Drúedain_:\n_Drû_+_Edain_. They were a strange people, living with the Haladin in\nthe forest of Brethil, some even apparently made it to Númenor, but they\ndied out or had left before the Akallabêth. In the Third Age, their far\nkin were known as the _Woses_ of the Drúadan Forest. They had dwindled\nto a very small number and were secretive but were renowned for the\nassistance they gave to the Rohirrim in the War of the Ring.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe Sindarin word _Edain_, singular _Adan_ (Quenya _Atani_, _Atan_),\nliterally meant _Second People_, and originally referred to all men, but\nlater it only applied to the Men of Beleriand and their descendants. The\nQuenya term _Atani_ kept its old meaning."

After the\ndeath of its tenth King, Eärendur, his sons had divided Arnor into the\nkingdoms of Arthedain, Rhudaur and Cardolan.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe borders of Cardolan extended from the river Brandywine to the west,\nthe river Hoarwell  to the east and the river Gwathló\n(Greyflood) to the east and south. Its northern border was the Great\nEast Road, but Cardolan also claimed the Arthedain-controlled Weather\nHills, which contained the fortress of Weathertop and its valuable\nPalantír. For this reason the Weather Hills were claimed by all three\nkingdoms - Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur. This territorial dispute\ncontinued until Rhudaur became a vassal of Angmar after the line of the\nDúnedain kings failed there.\n\nWhen the kingdom of Angmar arose in northern Eriador, Cardolan became\nthe most important ally of Arthedain. It had to fight the combined\narmies of both Angmar and Rhudaur. It soon became apparent that Cardolan\ncould not hold back the forces of Angmar and in its last years the\npeople became entrenched in the hill region, Tyrn Gorthad (the\nBarrowdowns). This position became untenable after Angmar sent evil\nspirits to inhabit the downs (the Barrow-wights). Arthedain could\nprovide little aid, as it was itself under attack. Around TA 1409\nCardolan was destroyed, and its former inhabitants accepted the King of\nArthedain as their lord. Arthedain managed to reconquer the land\nbriefly, but few people wished to live there on account of the\nBarrow-wights, and so Cardolan was never re-populated. \n\nAfter the final fall of Arnor, and the destruction of Angmar at the\nBattle of Fornost, Cardolan remained an unpopulated area until the\nreestablishment of the northern kingdom under King Aragorn II Elessar at\nthe end of the Third Age. Until then, the region was largely\nunclaimed and known as Minhiriath.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Cardolan_ appears to be a dialect Sindarin word for 'Red Hill\nLand'.",

Amlaith, the\ntrue heir to the throne of Arnor, was opposed by his two brothers.\nUnable to resolve the situation, he was reduced to ruling the region of\nArthedain, which consisted approximately of the lands west of the\nBrandywine River and north of the Great East Road. (His brothers created\nthe kingdoms of Cardolan and Rhudaur to the south.)\n\nThe kingdom's capital was at Fornost, and Bree was one of its most\nimportant towns. Annúminas was in the territory of Arthedain, but mostly\nabandoned and falling into ruin.\n\nIn TA 1300 the kingdom of Angmar appeared at Arthedain's north-eastern\nborder. Its King was the chief of the Ringwraiths, although this was not\nknown to the Dúnedain. When this new threat came Cardolan placed itself\nunder the suzerainty of Arthedain, which then began to call itself ARNOR\nagain. Cardolan repeatedly sent aid to Arthedain when needed but by TA\n1409 Cardolan and Rhudaur were conquered by Angmar.\n\nArthedain kept up the resistance against Angmar for over 500 years but\nin TA 1974 Arthedain was overrun and Fornost fell into the hands of\nAngmar. It fell just one year too soon for help was underway from Gondor\nunder the lead of Eärnur. This army reached Arthedain in TA 1975 and\ndestroyed Angmar at the Battle of Fornost.\n\nIts last King, Arvedui, drowned just before the battle was fought. The\nkings of Arthedain were also the lords of The Shire and the Shire chose\nthe Thain to replace the kings.\n\nThe son of Arvedui, Aranarth decided not to rebuild the kingdom and so\nbecame the first Chieftain of the Dúnedain. From him Aragorn is\ndescended.\n\n\nArthedain (people)\n\nThe ARTHEDAIN (Sindarin for _Edain of the Realm_) were the Dúnedain of\nthe old Kingdom of Arthedain.They were the purest-blooded descendants of\nthe Númenóreans among the Dúnedain of Arnor.

Rangers of the North, or simply THE RANGERS, were\nthe northern wandering people of Eriador, the last remnant of the\nDúnedain of Arnor\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Arthedain_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Realm of the Edain'.\nArthedain(people)\n\nwere the Dúnedain of the old Kingdom of Arthedain.They were the most\npure blooded descendants of the Númenóreans among the Dúnedain of the\nnorth.\n\nOther mannish peoples of the kingdom of Arthedain included:\n\n-   the Forodrim or eriadorian Northmen of the northern marches\n-   the Breelanders\n-   the Rivermen of Númeriador and the Baranduin\n-   the Lossoth, sometimes temporarily encamped in the northern borders\n    to the ice bay of Forochel.

    "text": "NARGOTHROND (Sindarin IPA: ) was the Elven stronghold built by Finrod\nFelagund, delved into the banks of the river Narog in Beleriand during\nthe First Age.\n\n\nDescription\n\nSimilar to the structures of many underground Dwarven cities,\nNargothrond consisted of many miles of caves and tunnels of various\nshapes and sizes carved through the rock, which was possibly limestone.\nThere were three Great Halls centered around the other tunnels and\ncaves, where the Lord of the city no doubt sat. The deepest of the caves\nwas the Innermost Chamber where Glaurung later hoarded up the remaining\ntreasures of Nargothrond and sat upon them until he left. Lúthien lived\nin a southwestern cave chamber during her stay there. The realms\narmouries were in several chambers south of the Great Halls. The main\nentrance through the Doors of Felagund to Nargothrond facing river Narog\none came into a large chamber, which was about five-hundred feet from\nthe Great Halls of Felagund.\n\n\nHistory\n\nYears of Peace\n\nInspired by Menegroth in Doriath, and seeking a hidden place from which\nto be safe from the forces of Morgoth, Finrod established it in the\nearly years following the return of the Ñoldor to Middle-earth, in the\nCaverns of Narog beneath the forested hills of TAUR-EN-FAROTH on the\nwestern bank of Narog. He was aided by the Dwarves of Nogrod who also\nmade for him the Nauglamír, the Necklace of the Dwarves.\n\nHowever, Finrod was not the first to delve in those caves: it had first\nbeen inhabited by the Petty-dwarves, who called it NULUKKIZDÎN (Khuzdul\nIPA: ) before they were driven out. Originally, a narrow path along the\nbanks of the river could only reach it, but later a bridge was built\nacross the Narog.\n\nFinrod ruled Nargothrond until he joined Beren in his Quest for the\nSilmaril, being succeeded by his nephew Orodreth. However, the Sons of\nFëanor, Celegorm and Curufin lived in Nargothrond at this time and\ncarried a great influence with its people, sowing fear and distrust of\noutsiders. After Finrod's death was reported they were exiled in\ndisgrace.\n\nFall of Nargothrond\n\n[Túrin and Glaurung, by woutart \n\nSince its foundation by Finrod, the Elves of Nargothrond had pursued a\nsecretive war against Morgoth, hunting his forces by stealth and ambush\nrather than going to open war. When Túrin was led there by Gwindor,\nhowever, he grew high in the esteem of Orodreth, Lord of Nargothrond,\nand counseled a different strategy.\n\nTúrin Turambar became one of the chief captains, persuading the people\nto abandon their long standing policy and instead fight openly against\nMorgoth.\n\nTúrin persuaded Orodreth to build the Bridge of Nargothrond to allow\nspeedy passage of forces into the field. Orodreth built the bridge from\nhis doors across the Narog, and went to open war with Morgoth. In\ncenturies of searching, Morgoth had been unable to find the fortress of\nNargothrond, but now not only was its location revealed, but the new\nbridge removed the defence of the River Narog. Glaurung the dragon was\nsent out from Angband with an army of Orcs to capture the city. After\nthe defeat of the army of Nargothrond at the field of Tumhalad in FA\n495, Glaurung and his army of Orcs came south, crossed the bridge, and\nsacked the city, killing or selling some of the inhabitants into\nslavery. The survivors, then went to seek refuge in Doriath, and that's\nhow Thingol knew of the fall of Nargothrond.\n\nGlaurung remained there until FA 499 when he went northeast to Brethil,\nto confront Túrin Turambar who eventually slew him. Though the realm was\nno more, Mîm the Petty-dwarf took up residence in caves claiming it and\nits treasures as his own in payment for the sufferings of his people,\nuntil Húrin came and slew him for his betrayal of his son. The treasure,\nincluding the Nauglamír, was then brought to the Elven Kingdom of\nDoriath and given to King Thingol. Afterwards, the caves were\ndestroyed during the War of Wrath, along with all of Beleriand.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_NARGOTHROND_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Narog-fortress-vaulted\nhall'.",

    "text": "THE SHIRE is subdivided into several regions.\n\n\nFarthings\n\nThe original parts of the Shire were subdivided into four FARTHINGS\n(“fourth-ings” or “quarterings”): the Three-Farthing stone marked the\npoint where the borders of the Eastfarthing, Westfarthing and\nSouthfarthing of the Shire came together, by the Great East Road.\n\nThe Northfarthing\n\nThe Northfarthing is the least populated part of the Shire. This was the\nsite of the historic Battle of Greenfields.\n\n-   LONG CLEEVE was the home of the small part of the Took clan known as\n    the _North-Tooks_, descendants of Bandobras “Bullroarer” Took, who\n    settled here after the Battle of Greenfields.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The village of HARDBOTTLE was the home to the Bracegirdle family of\n    Hobbits, to whom Lobelia Sackville-Baggins belonged. Some maps\n    erroneously place Hardbottle in the Southfarthing.\n\nThe Westfarthing\n\nThe western and most populated part of the Shire, this is the site of\nthe towns Michel Delving, Tuckborough (part of Took-land), and Hobbiton.\n\n-   MICHEL DELVING is the chief town of the Shire, located in the White\n    Downs. Its name means simply “large excavation”.\n\n        The Mayor of Michel Delving is the only elected official of The\n        Shire, elected on a seven year term.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   HOBBITON is the village where Bag End is located. This is the home\n    of Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins and the site of the beginning and\n    conclusion of the novels _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_.\n    Sam Gamgee and his grandfather, the “Gaffer”, live on the lane of\n    _Bagshot Row_, below Bag End.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Bywater is a village a short walk east of Hobbiton. It is best known\n    as the home of two inns, The Green Dragon Inn and The Ivy Bush.\n\nThe Southfarthing\n\nA rural and fertile area, the Southfarthing is the site of the towns\nGamwich (original home of the Gamgee family), Cotton, Longbottom and\nmuch pipe-weed production.\n\n-   LONGBOTTOM, a name meaning “long valley”, was founded by Tobold\n    Hornblower with the introduction of pipe-weed, in TA 2670, allowing\n    the region to become well established due to the success of the\n    pipe-weed industry.\n\nThe Eastfarthing\n\nBorders on Buckland, contains the towns Frogmorton and Whitfurrows and\nthe farms of the Marish. Originally, the Eastfarthing was under the\ncontrol of the Oldbuck family. Even after these became the Brandybucks,\nthe farmers of the Eastfarthing followed the Brandybucks rather than the\nThain and Mayor.\n\n-   THE YALE is the name of the low-lying lands of the Shire's\n    Eastfarthing that lay along the northern side of the long road from\n    Stock westwards to Tuckborough. This seems to have been a sparsely\n    populated area, and in fact the map of the Shire in _The Lord of the\n    Rings_ marks only a single building here.\n    -   The meaning of the Yale's name is obscure. The well-known\n        English personal and placename “Yale” has its origins in a Welsh\n        expression meaning “fertile upland.” Its use may suggest that\n        the Hobbits who named it had contacts with “strange” languages,\n        possibly those of Dunland.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   THE MARISH is the name of fertile, yet boggy farmlands located in\n    the Shire's Eastfarthing. It is where the Oldbuck family is believed\n    to have lived before Gorhendad Oldbuck removed the family across the\n    Brandywine to Buckland and changed their name\n\n\nOther parts of the Shire\n\nThe Buckland and Westmarch are sometimes reckoned part of the Shire,\nthough they are not part of any Farthing. Buckland was described in\nChapter V _A conspiracy unmasked_ in Fellowship of the Ring as being\n_“virtually a small independent country.. a sort of colony of the\nShire.”_ Westmarch became part of the Shire only after the end of the\nevents portrayed in Lord of the Rings, in the fourth age.\n\nBuckland\n\nLocation, villages and borders\n\nBuckland is located east of the Baranduin (Brandywine) river. The\nhobbits living in Buckland grew the High Hay, a hedge, to protect\nthemselves against evil from the nearby Old Forest, which borders\nBuckland to the east. Buckland is bordered in the north by the Hay Gate,\nthe only entrance to Buckland near the Brandywine Bridge. In the south\nthe borders of Buckland follow the High Hay until the Withywindle joins\nthe Baranduin near the village of Haysend. The most important town of\nBuckland is _BUCKLEBURY_ where the Brandy Hall is located, home of the\nMaster of Buckland, one of the important officials of the Shire.\n\nAn important landmark is the _BUCKLEBURY FERRY_, a raft-ferry used as\nthe second main crossing point of the Brandywine River from the Shire to\nBuckland, after the Brandywine Bridge (which is twenty miles further\nsouth). It is apparently left unmanned to be used by hobbit travellers\nas needed. En route to the new house at Crickhollow, Frodo, Sam, Merry\nand Pippin crossed using the Ferry just before the arrival of a Black\nRider, who was forced to go around to the Brandywine Bridge as there\nwere no boats kept on the western bank of the river.\n\nHistory and Culture\n\nBuckland was settled around TA 2340 by Gorhenhad Oldbuck, the ancestor\nof Meriadoc Brandybuck. Gorhenhad Oldbuck thus became the first Master\nof Buckland. He renamed himself Brandybuck, which remained his family's\nname.\n\nBecause Buckland is east of the Baranduin it isn't part of the land\ngiven to the Hobbits by King Argeleb II of Arthedain. It was thus not\npart of the Shire proper until the beginning of the Fourth Age when King\nElessar made Buckland and the Westmarch officially a part of the Shire.\n\nThe Bucklanders are unlike other hobbits as they are prepared for danger\nand are thus less naive than the Shire-hobbits. They close the Hay Gate\nand their own front doors at night and are prepared to rush to arms when\nthe Horn of Buckland is blown. Most Bucklanders were originally of Stoor\nstock, and they were the only Hobbits known to use boats.\n\nThe Westmarch\n\nAfter the events of the War of the Ring at the start of the Fourth Age\nof Middle-earth, King Aragorn Elessar granted the Hobbits of the Shire\neffective self-rule inside his Reunited Kingdom, banning any men from\nentering the land.\n\nHe also granted the Shire a stretch of new land: this reached from the\nancient western borders of the Shire, the White Downs, to the Tower\nHills.\n\nThe area between the downs and the hills became known as the WESTMARCH.\n\nThe eldest daughter of mayor Samwise Gamgee, Elanor the Fair, married\nFastred of Greenholm, and they moved to the Westmarch. After the passing\nof master Samwise, they and their children became known as the\n_Fairbairns of the Towers_ or _Wardens of Westmarch_, and the Red Book\nof Frodo and Bilbo Baggins passed into their keeping, becoming known as\nthe _Red Book of Westmarch_.\n\nGovernmentally, the Westmarch was a region of itself, and like Buckland\nacross the river Brandywine it was not part of any of the four Farthings\nof the Shire.\n\n Category:The Shire"

Beren was\nnow the last person of the house of Bëor but in the Second Age some\nfamilies of Númenor still spoke Adûnaic with a notable Bëorian accent.\n\nFurthermore, the majority of faithful were those of Bëorian descent.\nThis was because the majority of the Men of Bëor had settled in the\nwestern part of Númenor, which later became the area controlled by the\nfaithful Lords of Andúnië. Traits of the House of Bëor were passed down\nto the Dúnedain of the Middle-earth and can be seen in Aragorn II\nElessar's physical description: lean, dark and tall, with “a shaggy head\nof dark hair flecked with grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keen\ngrey eyes.”\n\n\nNotable members\n\n-   BËOR THE OLD, originally named Balan and later given the title _the\n    Old_, was leader of the House of Bëor, the first men to travel into\n    Beleriand. He met Finrod Felagund, who guided them to settle in\n    Estolad, east of Doriath. Bëor took service with Finrod in\n    Nargothrond. His name _Bëor_ meant _vassal_ in the Bëorian tongue.\n    He got his title, _the Old_, because he died at 93 years of age, of\n    which 44 were spent serving Finrod.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BARAN was the eldest son of Bëor the Old and took up the leadership\n    of the House of Bëor when his father departed to Nargothrond. He\n    dwelt in Estolad and had two sons, BORON and BARANOR.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BEREG, a grandson of Baran, was dissatisfied with Estolad, and led\n    part of the people away to parts unknown, disappearing from the\n    histories. It is possible some of his descendants were the ancestors\n    of the later Men of Eriador.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BOROMIR was a son of Boron. The later Boromir of Gondor was named\n    after him. Boromir was granted the land of Ladros in Dorthonion as a\n    fief, and his house removed there.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BREGOR was a son of Boromir and Andreth was Boromir's daughter.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BREGOLAS, who died in the Dagor Bragollach, and BARAHIR were sons of\n    Bregor.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BEREN was a son of Barahir, perhaps the greatest hero of the First\n    Age. He and Luthíen went to Morgoth and successfully cut a Silmaril\n    from his crown.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BARAGUND was a son of Bregolas and a direct descendant of Bëor the\n    Old. He had one daughter, Morwen, and he was the grandfather of\n    Túrin Turambar. He survived the Dagor Bragollach and lived as an\n    outlaw with his uncle Barahir and some companions.

It shared a long border\nwith Cardolan along the Great East Road, and with Arthedain along the\nline of the Weather Hills.\n\nThe land between the rivers Hoarwell and Loudwater was also considered\npart of Rhudaur. It was called _the Angle_, and it is here that the\nfirst Stoor Hobbits came into Eriador around TA 1150. However, due to\nthe increasing hostility of Angmar these Stoors fled the region around\nTA 1356, with some of them moving west to the Shire, and others moving\nback to Wilderland.\n\n\n\nFrom the start of its existence, Rhudaur was unfriendly towards the two\nother successor states, and took part in a bitter conflict with\nArthedain over the Tower of Amon Sûl and the Palantír associated with\nthe tower.\n\n\n\nThe last Kings of Rhudaur were not of Númenórean blood, but were\ndescended of Men in service of Angmar.

By this time, the\nDúnedain were gone from the region, as well as most of the other\ninhabitants.\n\nThere is evidence that after the fall of Angmar at the Battle of Fornost\nthe Angle became home to the remainder of the Dúnedain, and the Rangers\nof the North established several villages there, where their people\nlived until the resurrection of the northern Kingdom under King Aragorn\nII Elessar at the end of the Third Age.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe _Haeranedain_ (S.“Far Wandering Edain”) were Rhudaurians of\nNúmenorean descent, most were actually mix-blooded Tergil.

The upper reaches of the River Sirion\npassed between the western slopes of Dorthonion and the Ered\nWethrin.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDorthonion was originally ruled by Angrod and Aegnor, sons of Finarfin,\nbut it was overrun by Morgoth in the Dagor Bragollach, after which it\nwas known as Taur-nu-Fuin which translates as _Forest under Night_ or\n_The Forest under the Shadow of the Night_.\n\nThe northeastern slopes of Dorthonion were known as Ladros, a fief given\nto Boromir of the House of Bëor. Here Barahir and a small band of\noutlaws dwelt until they were all slain at Tarn Aeluin by Orcs sent by\nSauron save for Beren, Barahir's son in FA 460. Beren dwelt alone in the\nwilderness of Dorthonion for a time until he left for Doriath and met\nLúthien.\n\nAlong with the other lands west of the Blue Mountains, Taur-nu-Fuin was\nmostly destroyed in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age.\nAfterwards, its highest points survived as the island TOL FUIN (Isle of\nNight), part of the WESTERN ISLES.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_DORTHONION_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'land of pines'."

The hobbits living in\nBuckland grew the High Hay, a hedge, to protect themselves against any\nevil from the nearby Old Forest, which borders Buckland to the east.\nBuckland is bordered in the north by the Hay Gate, the only entrance to\nBuckland near the Brandywine Bridge. In the south, the borders of\nBuckland follow the High Hay until the Withywindle joins the Brandywine\nnear the village of Haysend. The most important town of Buckland is\n_BUCKLEBURY_ where Brandy Hall is located, home of the Master of\nBuckland, one of the important officials of the Shire.\n\nAn important landmark is the _BUCKLEBURY FERRY_, a raft-ferry used as\nthe second main crossing point of the Brandwine river from the Shire to\nBuckland, after the Brandywine Bridge (which is twenty miles further\nnorth). It is apparently left unmanned to be used by hobbit travellers\nas needed. En route to the new house at Crickhollow, Frodo Baggins, Sam\nGamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took crossed using the Ferry\njust before the arrival of a Black Rider, who was forced to go around to\nthe Brandywine Bridge as there were no boats kept on the western bank of\nthe river. \n\n\nHistory\n\nBuckland was settled around TA 2340 (SR 740) by Gorhendad Oldbuck, the\nancestor of Meriadoc Brandybuck. Gorhenhad Oldbuck thus became the first\nMaster of Buckland. He renamed himself Brandybuck, which remained his\nfamily's name.\n\nBecause Buckland is east of the Brandywine, it isn't part of the land\ngiven to the Hobbits by King Argeleb II of Arthedain. It was thus not\npart of the Shire proper until the beginning of the Fourth Age when King\nElessar made Buckland, now renamed the EASTMARCH, and the Westmarch\nofficial parts of the Shire.\n\n\nCulture\n\nThe Bucklanders are unlike other hobbits as they are prepared for danger\nand are thus less naive than the Shire-hobbits. They close the Hay Gate\nand their own front doors at night and are prepared to rush to arms when\nthe Horn of Buckland is blown. Most Bucklanders were originally of Stoor\nstock, and they were the only Hobbits known to use boats."

Translated into English, it reads, “_Sting_ is my name; I am the\nspider's bane.” The Appendix of ''The Silmarillion _defines_ _the\nelement _maeg'' in Sindarin as meaning “sharp” or “piercing”. During the\nThird Age, it was wielded by Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins, and Samwise\nGamgee.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nSting was an ancient Elvish blade made by weapon-smiths in Gondolin.\nWhen Orcs or goblins were within an undetermined radius of it, the blade\nglowed blue, alerting the wielder and others who could see it to their\npresence. It had been lost during the Fall of Gondolin, the same battle\nin which Turgon fell and Glamdring was taken. It appeared as a curved\nblade with a silver loop or spiral design on it, later runes were added\nto it by Bilbo after his adventures. These runes seem to have been made\nby the Elves as they are in Sindarin.\n\nIn _The Hobbit_, Bilbo and his dwarven companions found Sting in a\nTroll-hoard alongside two other elven blades: Glamdring and Orcrist.\nThough just a dagger by the standard of elves, Sting made a perfect\nshort sword for a Hobbit, although it was still rather small, as Bilbo\ninitially chose to wear it “inside his breeches” and was still able\nto travel and even run without any apparent inconvenience.\n\nJust before his nephew embarked on his quest to Mordor from Rivendell,\nBilbo gave Sting to Frodo. Sam then took the weapon from his (seemingly\ndead) master and used it to good effect against Shelob on the borders of\nMordor. After the defeat of Sauron at the end of the Third Age, Frodo\nentrusted Sting to Sam and it became an heirloom of the Gamgee family.\n\nGollum, who disliked anything made by the Elves, was afraid of Sting.\nThis fear aided Bilbo when he confronted Gollum in the Cave at the base\nof the Misty Mountains in _The Hobbit_. It also helped Frodo and Sam\nsubdue Gollum in _The Lord of the Rings_. Orcs also had an instinctive\nfear of these weapons and hated any who carried them.\n\nAs is fitting for a blade of Gondolin, Sting could easily cut through\nthe webs of the offspring of Ungoliant, including the evil Shelob and\nthe spiders of Mirkwood. Bilbo had named the weapon _Sting_ after he had\n“stung” one of them with it. In The Hobbit when Bilbo wears the One\nRing, and defends himself against a spider, he names the blade “Sting”.\nThe narrator describes the spider's lack of acquaintance with creatures\nwith such stings, and evidently this was also Bilbo's presumption in\nnaming it as such. Sting was like Glamdring and Orcrist in that “being\nthe work of Elvish smiths in the Elder Days these swords shone with a\ncold light, if any Orcs were near at hand.” But only Sting was\ndefinitively described as glowing blue, or glittering with blue flame at\nits edges.\n",

When the Númenórean realm in exile of Arnor was founded, the\nArnorians took over the maintenance of the Men-i-Naugrim, and built\nseveral fortresses on or near it (including Weathertop), and expanded or\ncreated bridges over the rivers Brandywine and Mitheithel. After Arnor\nwas divided in TA 861, the Great East Road formed the boundary between\ntwo of its successor states, Cardolan and Rhudaur.\n\nThird Age\n\nBy the time of the War of the Ring in the late Third Age, where the\nGreat East Road met the Greenway lay the ancient village of Bree. A days\nride east lay The Forsaken Inn, beyond which lay Rivendell. West of the\ncrossroads the hobbits had colonized the Shire, and their most important\ntowns lay athwart the East Road; (Hobbiton and Michel Delving to name\ntwo).\n\nAftermath\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, sections of the road that ran through the\nShire would have been off-limits to Men, under a proclamation of King\nElessar.",

With her\nsister realm, Nogrod, Belegost was dug deep beneath Mount Dolmed in the\nBlue Mountains in the Ages of Stars.\n\nAmongst the Dwarves of Belegost were the finest smiths and stone-carvers\nin Middle-earth. In their armourer's halls they made many bright weapons\nand were the first people to forge chain-mail. The Dwarves of Belegost\ntraded with the Sindar Elves of Beleriand and supplied them with weapons\nof incomparably tempered steel; furthermore these Dwarves carved the\nstone chambers of Menegroth. One of their payments for these services\nwas Nimphelos, a great pearl.\n\nIn the First Age, the Dwarves of Belegost and their lord, Azaghâl, won\ngreat fame in the War of the Jewels. In the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the\nDwarves alone could withstand the heat of the Dragon-fire because being\na race of smiths were used to great heat and on their helms they wore\nmasks of steel. Their axes too that they forged were strong enough to\nhold the Dragons in check.

    "text": "The BATTLE OF THE BLACK GATE, also known as the BATTLE OF THE\nMORANNON, was the final major battle of the War of the Ring. It resulted\nin the ultimate defeat of Sauron not by victory on the battlefield, but\nby means of the destruction of the One Ring by the hobbit Frodo.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nAfter the victory of the Free Peoples in the Battle of the Pelennor\nFields, the enemy retreated to Mordor. Sauron was defeated but he still\nhad thousands of Orcs at his disposal in Mordor. He was aware that the\nOne Ring was somewhat close to the vicinity of his territory, but he did\nnot know that the Hobbit Frodo Baggins and his companion Samwise Gamgee\nhad entered Mordor via Morgul Vale with the intention of destroying the\nRing.\n\nPlot against the Dark Lord\n\nAfter the Last Debate, the Men of the West assembled the Host of the\nWest, 10,000 strong, led by Aragorn, who marched on the Black Gate as a\ndiversionary feint to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo and Sam,\nwho were carrying the One Ring through Mordor to be destroyed in the\nfires of Mount Doom. It was hoped that Sauron would think Aragorn had\nthe Ring and was now trying to use it to overthrow him in Mordor.\n\n\n\nMustering\n\nInitially, the Host of the West consisted of 10,000 men, but 3,000\nRohirrim were sent to guard the crossroads, leaving Aragorn with 7,000\nmen. Before they reached Ithilien they were ambushed by Haradrim and\nEasterlings, but they drove them away easily with no casualties.\n\nThen, as they approached Dagorlad, some of the farmers of Lossarnach and\nRohan were too afraid to continue to pass the Desolation of the\nMorannon. Aragorn dismissed the faint-hearted, ordering them to liberate\nCair Andros on the river Anduin. This resulted in the departure of an\nestimated 1000 men, leaving Aragorn with 6,000.\n\nParley with the Dark Lieutenant\n\nBefore the battle began, the Black Gate opened slightly, letting out a\nsmall embassy. At the head was a high servant of Sauron, a Black\nNúmenórean called the Mouth of Sauron, who had been ordered to speak\nwith the Captains of the West. He reasoned that the Army of the West\ncould not defeat Sauron's host on the battlefield, and demanded the Army\nsurrender. The Lieutenant then brought forth several items that had\nbelonged to Frodo and Sam (Sam's sword, an Elven cloak, and Frodo's\nMithril shirt). Gandalf asked for the terms of their surrender, which\nwere to allow Sauron dominion over Isengard and Rohan, as well as\nGondor's vassalage. Gandalf vehemently refused.\n\nRealizing the Army intended to fight and being outnumbered, fear and\nanger overcame the Lieutenant, and he retreated to the Morannon, which\nthen opened to reveal a massive army of Sauron's forces. Thousands of\nOrcs also emerged from the hillsides around the Morannon. In the film\nAragorn, not believing what happened to Frodo, beheads The Mouth of\nSauron.\n\nThe Battle\n\nAgainst the Host of the West was arrayed a large hordes of Orcs, Trolls,\nand Mannish allies such as the Easterlings and Haradrim. An exact count\nis not given of the number of Sauron's forces, but it is said that they\nwere “ten times and more than ten times” greater than the Host of the\nWest, making it a force of at least 60,000. Sauron's forces surrounded\nthe Armies of the West on three sides, with the Easterlings on the left\nflank, the Orcs held the center, and the Haradrim on the right.\nInitially, Sauron's forces found difficulty in getting to the Army of\nthe West, due to the large slag pools and pits of waste surrounding\nparts of the Morannon, which impeded their progress. The Armies of the\nWest always had cohesive stability within their center and kept the\nEnemy from breaking through by force of numbers. The solid infantry\nsquares of Gondor infantry beat off their inferior Orcish opponents\nwhile the Rohirrim cavalrymen staved off the archers of the Harad. The\nsmall force of Easterlings launched a quick attack before being repulsed\nby the armies of Gondor and Rohirrim while the larger Haradrim force\nslowly retreated to the hills. By now, pressure had eased off of the\nflanks of the Armies of the West, who smashed into the lines of the\nOrc-host, slowly beating them off and forcing a retreat back through the\nBlack Gate (though not without suffering sizable losses of their own).\n\n\n\nDuring the course of the battle, the remaining eight Nazgûl emerged and\nattacked the Army of the West. Shortly thereafter, however, the Great\nEagles of the Misty Mountains, led by Gwaihir the Windlord, arrived and\nattacked the Ringwraiths, preventing them from pressing their aerial\nadvantage. Trolls began to crash through the lines of infantry, and the\nOrcs and Easterlings made renewed assaults on the Army of the West,\nencircling it. Many of the soldiers of the West began to become\ndistraught. That was when Frodo put on the One Ring and Sauron realized\nthat Frodo and the Ring were inside Mount Doom.\n\nThe Fall of Barad-dûr and Sauron\n\nThe Nazgûl immediately left the battle to intercept Frodo. Before they\ncould get there however, Gollum bit the Ring off Frodo's finger and\ndanced with joy accidentally falling into the Crack of Doom, destroying\nthe Ring, and Sauron's power was overthrown.\n\n\n\nBarad-dûr, the Black Gate, and the Towers of the Teeth collapsed to\nruin. The Orcs and other creatures of Sauron were completely\ndirectionless with the Dark Lord's demise and were easily defeated and\ndestroyed by the remaining troops of the Host of the West. Some of the\nEasterlings and Haradrim fought on stalwartly, though eventually many\nthrew down their weapons and surrendered (later to be sent home in peace\nby Aragorn).\n\nThe Rest of the Battle\n\nDespite the destruction of Mordor and its armies, the fight against\nSauron's remaining forces would continue in the northern theater of the\nWar of the Ring for several weeks, notably at Dol Guldur in Mirkwood and\nat The Lonely Mountain, but the power of Sauron, the Dark Lord of\nMordor, was no more.\n\nMonths later, the Battle of Bywater in the Shire against Ruffians men\nled by Saruman, and the subsequent killing of Saruman by Wormtongue who\nthen was later slain, ended the War of the Ring.\n",

    "text": "The BATTLE OF OSGILIATH was a battle during the War of the Ring at the\nruined city of Osgiliath - and a prelude to the Battle of the Pelennor\nFields.\n\n\nHistory\n\nPrelude\n\nPrior to this, Sauron had regained all his military strength and was\nprepared to attack Middle-earth. He first planned to attack his most\npowerful enemy, the land of Gondor, where “the hammer stroke will fall\nhardest”, but in order to destroy Gondor's capital, Minas Tirith, he\nfirst needed to capture Osgiliath, a ruined fortress-city strategically\npositioned on the river. Fords across the river were located in\nOsgiliath (half of the city was located on each side of the river) that\nwere the only path a large army could cross the Anduin for hundreds of\nmiles up or downstream (from Cair Andros to Pelargir). If captured,\nSauron could freely move his main army across the river and to the\nprimary target of his strategy in the war, Minas Tirith.\n\nThe Battle\n\nThe battle to control the ruins of Osgiliath had actually been fought,\non and off, for over a century since the fall of Ithilien to Mordor. A\nrenewed offensive by Mordor to take the city had begun several years\nprior to the Quest of Mount Doom (several years before TA 3018), and was\nfought continuously after that point with occasional lulls. The forces\nof Gondor, led by their captain-general Boromir, engaged in fierce urban\nwarfare during this long siege. Under Boromir's command the enemy was\npushed out of the half of the city on the west bank of the river, and on\na strike force including Boromir and his younger brother Faramir was\nable to destroy the last bridge in the city that connected the two banks\nof the river. This prevented Mordor's army from making an easy crossing,\nalthough the fords remained. Sauron not sending more troops to\nOsgiliath, but instead massing them within Mordor for a killing-blow\nmonths later probably caused this lull in the Mordor-offensive. During\nthis break in heavy fighting, Boromir left Gondor to seek counsel at\nRivendell; he would never return.\n\nDuring this time, Faramir led several Ranger attacks deep into\nMordor-occupied Ithilien, ambushing enemy armies moving to the Black\nGate; Frodo and Sam stumbled into one such attack, as told in _The Two\nTowers._\n\nWhen the Great Signal from Mordor went up and another answered from\nMinas Morgul, the War of the Ring properly began, even though Isengard\nhad been fighting before this and Sauron had been pursuing his other\nfronts. Thus, the Battle of Osgiliath was the first battle of the war in\na strict sense.\n\nWhile there were men defending the west side of Osgiliath, the Steward\nDenethor ordered Faramir to lead a force to reinforce them. Faramir\nregarded the order ill advised and certain to result in death, but\ncomplied.\n\nHowever, Mordor was prepared. Months beforehand, the Orcs in East\nOsgiliath had been secretly constructing massive numbers of boats and\nrafts, and swelled with reinforcements from Harad they swarmed across\nthe River Anduin to the Gondor positions on the other bank. After long\nand heavy fighting, the garrison under Faramir and his troops were\nforced to flee back to Minas Tirith, behind the Rammas Echor. Faramir\nhimself was badly wounded in the retreat, when a poisoned Southron arrow\npierced him; more severe damage was done by the Black breath of the\nNazgûl. When the retreat was sure to be a disaster, the knights of the\nDol Amroth sortie led by Imrahil arrived; the pursuing hordes were\ndriven back and the garrison reached the city safely.\n\nIn the meantime, the Orcs made makeshift repairs to several destroyed\nbridges. The main combined army of Mordor then arrived, formed from\nthose that Frodo saw leaving Minas Morgul, but this was “but one and not\nthe greatest of the hosts that Mordor now sent forth”: for on their way\nfrom The Morgul Vale, the orcs the Minas Morgul cavalry led by the\nWitch-king of Angmar had been joined with the Haradrim from the south,\nand a far greater host that had massed at the Black Gate joined them at\nOsgiliath, and the combined forces now entered the western bank of\nOsgiliath. More also came from the fords at Cair Andros, which was\nrecently captured, but they would not reach Minas Tirith until later.\n\nAftermath\n\nOsigiliath now completely in the hands of Mordor, the vast army of\nSauron marched from the city and surrounded Minas Tirith, beginning the\nsiege of Gondor and leading directly into the Battle of the Pelennor\nFields.\n",

    "text": "The BATTLE OF ISENGARD was described as an assault launched by a large\ngroup of Ents and Huorns. Persuaded by Treebeard to take action, they\nattacked Isengard and liberated the fortress, although they could not\nbring down Orthanc. It wasn't very well protected, as all the Uruk-hai\nhad been sent to Rohan, leaving only weak Orcs behind.\n\nTreebeard tore down the gates of Isengard as many Orcs fled and were\nkilled by the many Huorns now surrounding Isengard. Saruman was on the\ngrounds when the attack began and retreated to Orthanc, almost caught by\nthe Ent, Quickbeam. Once Saruman was inside he started up the machinery\nhoused underground, with several Ents scorched by the fumes and fires\nthat erupted. Treebeard then calmed the enraged Ents and put them to\nwork on tearing down the dam, releasing the river and cleansing Isengard\nof Saruman's treachery.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nAfter a three day long Entmoot, an army of Ents and Huorn set off for\nthe tower-fortress of Isengard, making a terrifying racket. They arrived\nand began their attack on March 2. The time of their assault was\nfortunate, because they arrived just when the wizard Saruman was\nemptying Isengard for a final assault on Rohan. As a result, there were\nfew left to defend Isengard besides Saruman himself.\n\nOnce the army of Isengard had left for Rohan, the Ents launched their\nattack on the walls. Attempts were made to hinder them with arrows, but\nthese only served to irritate the attackers further, and, in a matter of\nminutes the Gate and much of the Southern wall was reduced to ruin.\n\n\nThe Battle\n\nAs the Hobbits Merry and Pippin, who were present during the battle,\nlater recounted to their friends, Ents are so strong that their _punches\ncan crumple iron like tinfoil_, and they can _tear apart solid rock like\nbreadcrusts._ A ring of Huorns surrounded Isengard and killed all\nescaping Orcs.\n\nOnce the Gate and walls had been reduced to rubble, a young Ent named\nQuickbeam in the Westron tongue, spotted Saruman, and made for him,\nshouting 'The Tree Killer!', for his people and all Fangorn forest in\ngeneral had suffered from heavy deforestation to fuel the furnaces of\nSaruman. Other Ents followed him, but Saruman succeeded in escaping into\nthe tower of Orthanc. Once in the tower, he activated spouts and vents\nall over the plain, scorching many Ents who had entered the fortress.\nOne Ent, Beechbone, was unlucky enough to be caught fully in one of the\nfiery blasts, and the death of this Ent by Saruman's fire caused the Ent\nhost to go berserk. Merry and Pippin recounted the incident, saying that\nthe enraged roars of the Ents were enough to crack the stones. They\ndestroyed the buildings and machinery on the plain, but could do nothing\nto hurt the tower itself.\n\nAt this point, the Ents took counsel and came up with a new plan of\nattack. By digging trenches and destroying Saruman's dam, the Ents and\nHuorns were to divert the course of the river Isen itself. As the Ents\ndid work destroying the dam, Gandalf appeared to Treebeard and the\nhobbits during the night. Gandalf took counsel with Treebeard, resulting\nin the Huorns' involvement at the Battle of the Hornburg. At midnight,\nthe Ents succeeded in destroying the dam, and the river flooded the\n'bowl' of Isengard, submerging everything but the tower and filling in\nall the tunnels and holes where the machinery of war had been. The\ndestruction of Isengard was complete, although Saruman was still\nuntouched in the tower. Some men from Dunland surrendered and were\nallowed to leave.\n\nThe sound defeat of Saruman's hosts at the Battle of the Hornburg and\nthe destruction of his fortress rendered him incapable of causing the\nWest any further military harm, although he still had the power of his\npersuasive and commanding voice, with which he could still do (and did\ndo) harm. Had the Ents not destroyed Isengard, despite the destruction\nof Saruman's main army, he still could have withstood a siege with his\nfew remaining forces behind Isengard's normally impregnable walls,\nbiding his time until he could renew his strength.\n",

It was there that the One\nRing was lost by Isildur and found again a long time later by Déagol the\nStoor.\n\n\nGeography\n\nThe fields started near the mouth of the river Gladden, and went on\nbeyond where it joined the Great River, extending onto its eastern\nbanks. It was a region of many dark pools and islets, with beds of reeds\nand rushes and many wildflowers - a particularly common flower being the\nYellow Iris, which grew there in profusion.\n\nIn ancient times when the Silvan Elves were in the region, there was a\npool or lake at the intersection of the two rivers; however, over time\nthis receded, forming the marshes.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIt was in the Gladden Fields that Isildur and his sons were travelling\nto Rivendell when they were assailed by Orcs in TA 2. Isildur, in an\nattempt to escape, jumped into the river, using the Ring to keep hidden.\nHowever, the Ring slipped from his finger as he swam away, landing in\nthe riverbed, and Isildur was slain by the Orcs' arrows on the bank of a\nsmall islet.\n\nThe fields were later settled by Stoors around TA 1356. The Ring\nremained undiscovered.\n\nAround two and a half millenia after the ambush, in TA 2463, the Hobbit\nDéagol found the ring when he was fishing with his cousin Sméagol: an\nespecially large fish pulled him under the water and, spotting it\namongst the weeds, he took it to the bank. Ensnared by the Ring's power,\nthe two fought over it, and ultimately it went to Sméagol, who killed\nDéagol and later became the creature called Gollum.\n\nLater, around TA 2851, Saruman began searching the wetlands for the\nRing. He found the Elendilmir, the token of Royalty of the\nNorth-kingdom, which Isildur had been wearing at the time of the attack.\nAt the meeting of the White Council that year, Saruman overruled\nGandalf's suggestion that they purge Sauron from his stronghold in Dol\nGuldur.\n\nSauron also sent his servants to search for the Ring. When the White\nCouncil learned of this, they agreed to an attack on Dol Guldur to\nprevent Sauron from finding the Ring, in TA 2941. At the meeting of the\nWhite Council in TA 2953, Saruman pretended that he had learned that the\nRing had been carried downriver to the Sea.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nGladden Fields was Sindarin for LOEG NINGLORON."

    "title": "War of Wrath",
    "page_id": "862",
    "text": "The WAR OF WRATH, also called the GREAT BATTLE, was the war of Elves,\nMen, Dwarves and Valar against Morgoth at the end of the First Age,\nwhich marked the end of his rule in Middle-earth. It was the largest\nbattle of the First Age and possibly the largest battle ever to have\ntaken place in Middle-earth. It resulted in the expulsion of Morgoth\nfrom Arda and the ruin of the Thangorodrim, but the violence of the\nclashes between the forces of the Valar and Morgoth shattered the\nnorthwestern portion of Middle-earth, Beleriand, and caused it to sink\nbeneath the ocean.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nBy the early sixth century of the First Age, Morgoth's dominion had\nbecome completely uncontested in Middle-earth. The power of the Elves,\nMen, and Dwarves to resist him had been utterly destroyed, and all the\ngreat kingdoms of the Elves had been overthrown. Morgoth was now master\nof nearly all of Beleriand, save for the havens in Arvernien, which he\ngave little heed to. To make matters worse, and to the great amusement\nof Morgoth, the Sons of Fëanor, seeking the Silmaril of Beren and\nLúthien, had launched two devastatingly brutal Kinslayings in which they\nhad destroyed both Doriath and the Havens of Sirion. In this time of\nneed, the mariner Eärendil, by the guidance of a Silmaril which he wore\non his forehead, searched for and came to Valinor on behalf of Elves and\nMen. There, he begged the Valar to pardon and aid the overmatched\npeoples of Middle-earth.\n\nThe Battle\n\nDespite having pledged to leave the Ñoldor to reap the bitter harvest of\ntheir folly in pursuing Morgoth, Manwë was moved by Eärendil's plea.\nAlong with the Vanyar and the remaining Ñoldor in Aman, the host of the\nValar came to Middle-earth in the mightiest gathering of arms in the\nhistory of Arda. The Teleri of Alqualondë granted the use of their ships\nto ferry the hosts of Aman to Middle-earth, but they remembered still\nthe Kinslaying of their people long ago and harbored much bitterness\nover it. As such, they sent only what mariners were needed to man the\nships, and none of them set foot on Middle-earth once they arrived. The\ngreat force of Aman marched across Beleriand, and met the armies of\nMorgoth in the plains of Anfauglith. Morgoth marshaled the entirety of\nhis forces, which had by this point grown so vast that Anfauglith could\nnot contain their numbers.\n\nThough the war lasted for over 40 years, the host of the Valar utterly\ndestroyed the Orc armies of Morgoth, as well as most of the Balrogs.\nWhile the Three Houses of Men fought alongside the Valar, many other Men\nfrom the East fought for the forces of Morgoth and were either destroyed\nor forced to flee back to the far eastern parts of Middle-earth. Facing\nfinal defeat, Morgoth released his ultimate weapon, the winged Dragons,\nwhich had never been seen before. Their terrible onslaught was\naccompanied by lightning storms and tempests of fire, and they drove the\nValar back and nearly destroyed the host of the West.\n\n\n\nFortunately, Eärendil came with his sky-ship Vingilot, along with the\nEagles of Manwë led by Thorondor. In the skies above Angband, they\nconfronted the dragons, and Eärendil himself slew their captain, the\nmighty Ancalagon the Black, who broke the towers of Thangorodrim in his\nfall. Angband was then leveled and Morgoth was finally captured in the\ndeepest of his mines. He sued for peace and pardon, but he was bound\nagain with the old chain Angainor and the two Silmarils still in his\npossession were taken by the Maia Eönwë, the herald of Manwë. Morgoth\nwas taken to Aman and tried for his crimes. In the end, the Valar\nun-housed Morgoth by beheading him and “thrust him through the Door of\nNight”, beyond the Walls of the World, into the Timeless Void, the doors\nof which are forever guarded by Ëarendil.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe geographical wreckage of the war was immense; most of the land west\nof the Blue Mountains was destroyed and sank beneath the waves. Though\nit is not known exactly how many casualties the Host of the West\nendured, the war dragged on for decades before they managed to approach\nAngband, and the attack of Morgoth's winged dragons was known to have\nbeen nearly catastrophic for the forces of the Valar. While the hosts of\nMorgoth were utterly defeated, the creatures that composed them were not\neradicated, and many (particularly Orcs) remained to trouble the world\nunder the power of Sauron. Additionally, it was noted that a few Balrogs\nfled and hid deep in the Earth, though only one, known by the title of\nDurin's Bane, was ever noted by history to have appeared again. Some\nnumber of dragons, particularly Cold-drakes, also hid themselves away in\nthe mountains. These dragons bred over time, and became particularly\ntroublesome for the Dwarves in ages to come. Nearly all of the winged\nFire-drakes were destroyed by Ëarendil, Thorondor and his Eagles, but\nsome managed to escape, as at least one of the species, Smaug the\nGolden, was known to have been active during the Third Age.\n\nThe remaining Elves were bidden by Ëonwë to return with him to the lands\nof Aman. Most of the Elves went into the West, while others still\nrefused the summons and rather journeyed eastward where they would\nbecome lords of the remaining Eldar or those Elves who still dwelt in\nthe East. Gil-galad, Galadriel, Celeborn, and Elrond were chief among\nthese. Additionally, the victory was made even more bitter by the loss\nof the Silmarils. Maedhros and Maglor, the two surviving sons of Fëanor,\nwere compelled by their oath to recover the gems. Though sick at heart\nat the burden of the terrible oath, they conspired to sneak into the\ncamp of the victorious Host of the Valar, where they slew the guard\naround the Silmarils and took them. The camp was roused against them,\nand though they were prepared to fight to the death to keep the gems,\nthey were permitted to go. But they soon discovered that, due to the\nwicked deeds they had performed in recovering the jewels, first among\nthem the three Kinslayings, they could not hold the Silmarils without\nsuffering terrible pain. And so Maedhros cast himself and the Silmaril\nhe bore into a fiery pit, and Maglor threw his into the Sea. And so both\nwere lost to the Host of the Valar, and they returned to Aman empty\nhanded.\n\nFor those men of the Edain who fought for the host of the Valar, the\nland of Númenor (in the full Quenya form Nùmenórë) was given to them.\nThis land was neither of Aman nor of Middle-earth, but was closer to\nAman.\n",

Melkor built\nand delved many subterranean halls and dungeons of obsidian, fire and\nice beneath it .\n\n\nHistory\n\nWhen the world was young and Arda was bathed in the light of the two\nlamps Illuin and Ormal, Melkor first dug the great Pits of Utumno deep\nbeneath the mountains of the North. The fortress was constructed in the\nNorth in the Iron Mountains over one thousand miles from the later\nlocation of Angband, where the light of the lamps was almost\nnonexistent.\n\nHere were gathered all the evil powers of the World under the Lord of\nDarkness. Their numbers were vast, and Melkor had twisted many beautiful\nthings into horrifying and dreadful forms. Many of the great evils of\nthe world were bred in this place, such as trolls, “made in mockery of\nthe ents” as stated by Treebeard. It is probable that the Orcs were\nfirst bred here also, by the mutilating and corruption of lost Elves.\nCruel spirits, phantoms, wraiths, and evil demons stalked the halls of\nUtumno and haunted the surrounding forests. All were under the command\nof Melkor and his fallen Maiar servants; Gothmog the Lord of the Balrogs\nand Sauron the Sorcerer.\n\nFrom Utumno, Melkor poisoned and interfered with all the Valar's work\ndone during the Spring of Arda. Soon afterwards, Melkor and his servants\nwaged his war against the lamps of the Valar and struck them down,\nruining the world, and forcing the Valar to move further west to the\ncontinent of Aman.\n\nUtumno endured for many more millennia well into the early years of the\nElves at Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees when Middle-earth lay\nin the light of stars. Taking advantage of the new arrivals, Melkor\ncaptured some of them and thus, the hideous race of orcs was bred.\nKnowing that Melkor would continue to be a blight upon the world, the\nValar decided to protect the elves by ending his power in the north.\nAmidst the sounding of the trumpets, the Valar came out of the west, and\nafter the Battle of the Powers Utumno was besieged and destroyed in VY\n1099 , and Melkor was chained for about three thousand years.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_UTUMNO_ was the Quenya word for “Underworld”, also known as UDÛN\n(Sindarin for 'Hell').\n\n\nEarlier versions of the legendarium\n\nEarlier texts referred to Utumno as the FORTRESS OF THE NORTH or\n_UTUMNA_.\n\nAlso, its location had once been north of the Iron Mountains rather than\nwithin them.",

They were lands\nconsisting mostly of hills and lowlands with dense forests, scattered\nwoodlands, scrubs, stunted trees, and thickets. Climates varied from\nseverely cold and dry winters with short and cold summers, to mild\nwinters with mild summers. All of which were under the influence of the\ncold and dry winds from Dor Daidelos and the Iron Mountains to the\nnorth, and the warm and moist winds coming from the sea.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the Return of the Ñoldor, the areas of the East Beleriand were\ninhabited by the Laiquendi living in the Ossiriand and the Sindar in\nother parts. When the Ñoldor did return, the majority of the region was\nunder control of Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod\nand Amras, the Sons of Fëanor. They built extensive fortresses and\nCastles in the area between Lothlann and Thargelion which buttressed\nMorgoth's domain in the farther north. The dominant languages here\nduring this time was Sindarin and Quenya but later there were also\nmannish speeches as well.\n\nBy the later First Age, more and more of this land fell under the power\nof Morgoth until it was finally conquered by the Dark Powers and was\nrenamed Dor Daedeloth. It, along with the rest of Beleriand, was\ndestroyed after the War of Wrath. However, some of it did survive into\nthe Second and Third Ages becoming Lindon, the land of Gil-galad and\nthen Círdan the Shipwright."

    "text": "ANGBAND, also known by its translation 'IRON PRISON', was the ancient\nfortress of Melkor under the Iron Mountains before the First Age, and\nfrom which he tried to subjugate Arda. It was destroyed at the\nconclusion of the War of Wrath. \n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nAngband was a primarily subterranean stronghold under the three volcanic\nmountains of Thangorodrim, the largest mountains in Middle-earth. Before\nthe Great Gate, there was a somber court area flanked by frightening\ncliffs and walled by the towers of a great battlement. Through the gate,\nthere was a long great tunnel leading to a 'labyrinthine pyramid' of\nstairs to corridors, tunnels, and smithy chambers. A tall chimney went\nfrom Morgoth's gigantic blast furnaces and smithies, up through the\nmountain to the smokey towers of Thangorodrim. There were also many\ntunnels leading to the slave quarters or vaults. At the foundation of\nAngband was the entrance to Morgoth's throne room in the Nethermost\nHall. There were also mines within Angband that extended deeper than\nMorgoth's throne room.\n\n\nHistory\n\nMelkor originally built Angband to guard against a possible attack from\nAman by the Valar, and placed it under the command of Sauron. However,\nat the initiation of the War of Powers, the assault of the Valar leveled\nAngband without much difficulty, and forced Melkor to flee to his\nprimary stronghold of Utumno. However, Angband's underground vaults and\ncaverns were left relatively intact after the Valar's onslaught, as they\nwere in great haste to capture Melkor for the sake of keeping the\nnewly-awakened Elves safe. After Melkor's defeat at Utumno, the Balrogs\ncame to Angband and went into hibernation in its ruined foundations.\nEventually, the Orcs began to multiply in great numbers in Angband's\nruins, and soon made their way south into Beleriand, threatening the\nDwarves and Thingol's kingdom. It is possible that Sauron remained in\nthe ruins of Angband with the Balrogs, as he had presumably been\ncommanding the fortress when it was attacked. However, it is not certain\nwhere Sauron dwelt during Melkor's imprisonment. After three ages,\nMelkor was released, destroyed the Two Trees of Valinor, stole the\nSilmarils and escaped from Aman.\n\nAfter fleeing, Melkor, now named _Morgoth_ by his enemies, returned to\nMiddle-earth and re-delved the ruins of Angband, raising the\nvolcanic peaks of Thangorodrim over it. These peaks were created from\nthe slag and rubble caused by the re-delving of the fortress, and as\nsuch, it is likely that the rebuilt Angband extended for a considerably\ngreater distance underground than it's original incarnation had. From\nhis dark throne in the Nethermost Hall, Morgoth directed the war against\nthe Ñoldor who had returned from the West, and all the Free Peoples that\nsupported them in Beleriand. Ultimately, he achieved complete victory\nover them. At the end of the First Age, the Valar took pity on the\nÑoldor and instigated the War of Wrath, which not only utterly destroyed\nAngband but broke most of northern Middle-earth so throughly that it\nsank beneath the ocean.\n\n\nEarlier versions of the legendarium\n\nIn earlier versions of Tolkien's mythology (see _The History of\nMiddle-earth_) Angband was called ANGAMANDO, which is the Quenya form of\nthe name.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Angband_ is a Sindarin word that meant 'iron prison'.",

It endured the\nlongest of all the Ñoldorin kingdoms in exile, lasting nearly\nfour-hundred years of the Sun.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nAs recounted in _The Silmarillion_, the Vala Ulmo, the Lord of Waters,\nrevealed the location of the Vale of Tumladen to the Noldorin Lord\nTurgon in a dream around the year FA 50. Under this divine guidance,\nTurgon travelled from his kingdom in Nevrast and found the vale in FA\n53. Within the Encircling Mountains just west of Dorthonion and east of\nthe river Sirion, lay a round level plain with sheer walls on all sides\nand a ravine and tunnel leading out to the southwest known as the Hidden\nWay.

It was the first permanent settlement of the\nNúmenóreans in Middle-earth. From here Aldarion's “Guild of Venturers”\nbegan harvesting the local timber for the shipbuilding industry of\nNúmenor.\n\nWithin a few centuries, the deforestation of the outlying regions\nEnedwaith and Minhiriath became cataclysmic, angering the local native\npopulation (ancestors of the Dunlendings), and they began to fight back\nwith increasing ferocity, destroying the haven several times, and\nfrequently burning the great wood-stores in 'hit-and-run' attacks.\n\nBy the time of the War of the Elves and Sauron in the middle of the\nSecond Age, this 'New Haven' had become very well established, and its\nname had shifted over the intervening one thousand years to 'Lond Daer',\nthe Great Haven.

It stood in the centre of the Ring of\nIsengard, surrounded by great defensive walls fortified by the early Men\nof Gondor.\n\n\nDescription\n\n''“A great ring-wall of stone, like towering cliffs, stood out from the\nshelter of the mountain-side, from which it ran and then returned\nagain... one who passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel,\nbeheld a plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed like a vast shallow\nbowl: a mile it measured from rim to rim. Once it had been green and\nfilled with avenues, and groves of fruitful trees, watered by streams\nthat flowed from the mountains to a lake. But no green thing grew there\nin the latter days of Saruman. The roads were paved with stone-flags\ndark and hard; and beside their borders instead of trees there marched\nlong lines of pillars, some of marble, some of copper and of iron,\njoined by heavy chains, to the centre all the roads ran between their\nchains. There stood a tower of marvelous shape. It was fashioned by the\nbuilders of old, who smoothed the Ring of Isengard, and yet it seemed a\nthing not made by the craft of Men, but riven from the bones of the\nearth in the ancient torment of the hills. A peak and isle of rock it\nwas, black and gleaming hard: four mighty piers of many-sided stone were\nwelded into one, but near the summit they opened into gaping horns,\ntheir pinnacles sharp as the points of spears, keen-edged as knives.\nBetween them was a narrow space, and there upon a floor of polished\nstone, written with strange signs, a man might stand five hundred feet\nabove the plain.” ''\n\n- Orthanc as depicted by J.R.R Tolkien\n\nThe tower was constructed out of four piers of stone and then hardened\nby an unknown process. No weaponry or magic that existed on Arda was\nknown to be able to harm it. Until the Ents that besieged Isengard\nduring the War of the Ring managed to inflict slight damage on the\ntower, but their efforts ultimately proved to be futile. When Grima\nthrew the Orthanc stone it fell on the stairs; the rail snapped and part\nof the staircase broke.\n\nThe only entrance to the tower was reached by a stair of twenty-seven\nsteps, the door could only be opened with the Keys of Orthanc. Above the\ndoor there was a balcony, and many tall windows higher up.\n\n\nHistory\n\nSecond Age\n\n\n\nThe exact date of construction of Orthanc and establishment of Isengard\nis unknown; however it must have been built between SA 3320, the time of\nthe establishment of Arnor and Gondor, and SA 3430, when the Last\nAlliance of Elves and Men was formed. Within the fortified walls of the\ntower was placed one of the Palantíri, the Stone of Orthanc. Thus,\nOrthanc was now known as one of the seven towers of the Dúnedain,\nhousing the seventh seeing stone brought back from Númenor by Elendil.\n\nThird Age\n\nOrthanc suffered greatly during the Great Plague of TA 1636, and many of\nthe Númenóreans that inhabited it gradually migrated eastward.\nEventually the tower itself became deserted and its keys being moved to\nMinas Tirith to be kept by the Stewards of Gondor.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Field of Celebrant in TA 2510, a small group of\nMen of Gondor travelled to Isengard and maintained the fortress on their\nown. However, the Keys of Orthanc still officially belonged to the\nStewards of Gondor.\n\nOver time, Orthanc lost its connections with Minas Tirith and the Men of\nGondor failed to maintain the tower successfully. The Dunlendings then\ntook over the fortress and launched many attacks on the Westfold. In the\nLong Winter of TA 2754, the Dunlendings were eventually starved out due\nto the famine caused by the lack of communication to all food suppliers.\nThen Saruman put in an offer for the control of Isengard and both King\nFréaláf and Steward Beren embraced the proposition with open arms. Thus,\nthe wizard was handed the keys to Orthanc.\n\n\n\nAfter gaining the control of Isengard, Saruman became greatly interested\nin the Rings of Power and began to especially desire the One. He thought\nthat if he gave time for Sauron to regain some strength, the ring would\nreveal itself to him. Therefore, as head of the White Council, Saruman\noverruled Gandalf's call for an attack on Dol Guldur, the Dark Lord's\nthen current fortress. However in TA 2941, he did agree on the attack\nwhen he found out that the servants of Sauron were searching for the\nring near the Gladden Fields.\n\n\n\nLater, Saruman's mind was corrupted and fell under the control of Sauron\nwhen he used the Stone of Orthanc—the seventh Palantiri—for the first\ntime.\n\nIn TA 3018, Gandalf rode to Isengard to meet with Saruman. It was then\nthat the wizard declared his true thoughts regarding his desire to be\nruler of Men, to possess the Ring, and to join Sauron in his evil deeds.\nGandalf refused Saruman's offer to join him and Sauron. Subsequently,\nthe wizard held Gandalf captive on Orthanc's pinnacle until he submitted\nin telling the location of the One Ring. After many weeks of\nimprisonment, Gwaihir, the Lord of the Eagles, came unlooked for and\nbore him away.\n\nOnly months later, the Ents of Fangorn Forest launched their attack on\nIsengard. By the next day, only the tower of Orthanc remained, as it was\nhewn of one piece of impenetrable rock, and the plains below had been\ncompletely destroyed, leaving a desolate land of water and mud. Three\ndays after the battle, Theoden, Éomer, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and\nGimli approached Orthanc past a desolation of wreckage caused by the\nEnts including a huge blood-ridden white hand, and climbed its stair.\nThey parleyed with Saruman, who remained inside the tower and spoke to\nthem from a balcony above the door. After Saruman refused to cooperate\nand attempted to control the Rohirrim riding with them, Gandalf cast him\nfrom the Order of Wizards and the White Council, breaking Saruman's\nStaff. After the confrontation, Grima Wormtongue—who was inside the\ntower at the time—threw the Stone of Orthanc at the party outside as a\nparting shot.\n\nFourth Age\n\n\n\nOne of King Elessar's first tasks he had set was the restoration of\nOrthanc. He ordered that the Palantir should be recovered and returned\nto the tower. Then Orthanc was searched and many secrets were revealed.\nIt was clear that Saruman had been hoarding many ancient treasures and\nheirlooms during his time there. With the aid of Wormtongue, Saruman had\nacquired many jewels and heirlooms belonging to Eorl. Soon a hidden door\nwas found and inside a casket they found two precious objects: one of\nwhich was a small gold case attached to a chain - this was used by\nIsildur to bear the One Ring; and second of which was the Elendilmir -\nthe 'white star of Elvish crystal upon a fillet of mithril' that had\nbeen lost since Isildur's demise. Elessar received the Elendilmir with\nreverence and took it with him as he established his full kingship of\nArnor. It was revealed that Saruman had found the remains of Isildur and\nhad burned them.\n\nOrthanc and the plains of Isengard around it remained part of the\nReunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor. However, King Elessar granted the\nEnts complete self-governance of the area surrounding the tower. This\nnew forest became known as the Treegarth of Orthanc.\n\n\nPinnacle of Orthanc\n\n\n\nThe Pinnacle of Orthanc was the summit of Saruman's tower. Its corners\nwere razor-edged points with room for at least two men to stand. It was\naccessed by a flight of thousands of stairs, which Saruman would use to\nreach the top and observe the stars.\n\nIt was here where Saruman imprisoned Gandalf at the start of the War of\nthe Ring, which caused him to be delayed in meeting with Frodo. He was\nrescued by the Great Eagle Gwaihir, sent by Radagast the Brown.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nAccording to Tolkien, its name is both Sindarin for “Mount Fang”, and\nRohirric for “Cunning Mind”. The latter is more likely to be its real\nmeaning, as the word _Orthanc_ is a real Old English word (Old English\nbeing the linguistic basis for Rohirric); the Sindarin name being no\nmore than a poetic coincidence. In Old English, Orþanc means “cunning\ndevice”, but Tolkien has said this is merely a coincidence.",

    "text": "The KINGDOM OF RHOVANION was a realm of Men in the Middle-earth region\nof Rhovanion that is rarely given specifications in Tolkien's books.\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe kingdom of Rhovanion was founded by the northmen and stretched from\nMirkwood, in the west, to Dorwinion, in the east. It had strong ties\nwith the kingdom of Gondor and fought side by side in its wars against\nthe Easterlings of Rhûn.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the early Third Age, a group of Northmen who were led by a 'Prince of\nRhovanion' who founded the Kingdom of Rhovanion sometime before the year\nTA 490. Rhovanion at this time referred only to the region where he and\nhis people dwelt, a strip of land east of Greenwood the Great and south\nof Dale and Lake-town. It is possible that Dale and Lake-town formed\npart of the Kingdom before the Dwarven Kingdom in the Lonely Mountain\nwas founded by the Dwarves of Durin's Folk.\n\nThe Men of Rhovanion fought with Gondor against the Easterlings of Rhûn,\nwho threatened their lands, and when these were defeated by King\nTurambar of Gondor in TA 550, Rhovanion became an ally of Gondor. By TA\n1200 the ruler of Rhovanion called himself the King of Rhovanion. In TA\n1248 Rómendacil II of Gondor destroyed all camps of the Easterlings even\nbeyond the Sea of Rhûn, and a strong alliance with Rhovanion was forged.\nGondor withdrew its borders to the Anduin, and ceded all the lands east\nof Anduin to Rhovanion. From this time onward, the name Rhovanion\nreferred to all of Wilderland.\n\nThe King of Rhovanion at this time was Vidugavia, and Prince Valacar of\nGondor served in his army. Vidugavia's daughter Vidumavi married\nValacar, and their son Vinitharya became King Eldacar of Gondor in TA\n1432, which led to the Kin-strife in TA 1437. Eldacar fled to Rhovanion,\nand with a Rhovanion army, he reclaimed his Kingdom in TA 1447.\n\nIn TA 1636 the Great Plague devastated Rhovanion, killing more than half\nits people. This left Rhovanion weakened, and in TA 1851 the Wainriders\noverran and enslaved Rhovanion. For 43 years Rhovanion was enslaved, but\nin TA 1899 Rhovanion rebelled, while Gondor attacked the Wainriders from\nthe west. Rhovanion was freed, but left extremely weakened. Many Men of\nRhovanion left for Gondor, where they were welcomed as distant\nrelatives. Some of them may have gone north to Dale and Lake-town after\nTA 1999, when the Kingdom under the Mountain was founded.\n\nIn TA 2460 Sauron returned to Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood, although\nthis was not learned until long after. The land gradually became more\ndangerous, and Rhovanion was emptied of most its people. Around TA 2510\na new group of Easterlings, the Balchoth, appeared, and they quickly\ntook the old lands of Rhovanion. This was the final end of the Kingdom\nof Rhovanion after over two thousand years of independence.",

Almost nothing is known about Khand or its\nnomadic people. “Variags” (men of Khand) fought for Sauron's army, but\nnothing aside from their name was mentioned.\n\n\nHistory\n\nKhand was under the influence of Mordor and supplied it with horses, and\ntwice came into the history of Gondor: first in the year TA 1944 when\nthe Variags together with the Wainriders attacked Gondor, and later\nduring the War of the Ring when they fought and died on the Pelennor\nFields.

    "text": "MINHIRIATH was a region of Eriador in Middle-earth.\n\nIts expanse covered the western half of the lands between the Misty\nMountains and the Blue Mountains (Ered Luin). Minhiriath had no clear\nborder in the north, but to the south, and east and west it was bounded\nby river and sea: the Brandywine, the Greyflood and the Belegaer, 'The\nGreat Sea'.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe original inhabitants of Minhiriath (Minhiriathrim) were descended\nfrom the same Men as the ancestors of the Númenóreans, but because they\nspoke mutually unintelligible languages, the Númenóreans did not class\nthe Minhiriathrim as Middle Men.\n\nWhen the large-scale deforestation of their land began under the\nNúmenórean 'Ship Kings' after the 7th century Second Age, the\nMinhiriathrim became openly hostile, and were persecuted. Only those who\n“fled from Minhiriath into the dark woods of the great Cape of Eryn\nVorn” survived. Most, if not all of these forest-dwellers subsequently\n“welcomed Sauron and hoped for his victory over the Men of the Sea”, but\nthey were to be disappointed - and permanently trapped - by Sauron's\nburning of much of the rest of the surviving forest, and final defeat,\nin SA 1701.\n\nFrom SA 3320, Minhiriath became nominally part of the newly established\nKingdom of Arnor, at which time it formed the upper part of _..a land\nthat was far and wide, on either bank a desert, treeless but untilled._\n\n('The History of Galadriel and Celeborn' from Unfinished Tales)\n\nFrom TA 861, Minhiriath was inherited by one of Arnor's three successor\nstates, Cardolan, but the “ravaging” of Cardolan by the evil forces of\nthe Witch-king of Angmar in TA 1409 no doubt caused extensive\ndepopulation of the whole country. Even worse was the advent of the\nGreat Plague in TA 1636, after which Minhiriath was “almost entirely\ndeserted”. After TA 1975, even though “a few secretive hunter-folk lived\nin the woods” throughout the Third Age (probably a reference which\nincludes Eryn Vorn), Minhiriath was claimed by no kingdom at all.\n\nAlthough “still in places well-wooded” by the time of the War of the\nRing, the once continuously forested Minhiriath bore the permanent scars\nof over 5000 years of felling, burning, and war.\n\nThe same is not necessarily the case for its human population, however,\nwhen talking of Eriador (and particularly the lands south and west of\nBree) to an innkeeper at the end of the War of the Ring. For example,\nGandalf confidently predicts that _..the waste in time will be waste no\nlonger, and there will be people and fields where once there was\nwilderness._\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Minhiriath_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Between Rivers' and thus an\nElvish form of _Mesopotamia_)."

These men were given the island of Numenor at the\nbeginning of the Second Age by the Valar.\n\n\nOrigins\n\nAs mentioned, the Númenóreans were the descendants of the Edain, the\nElf-friends of the First Age. As a reward for their services during the\nWar of Wrath, the Valar gave them an island continent in the western sea\nwhich became Númenor as their abiding place. They also gifted with far\nlonger life (300 years or more average), greater height, and greater\nwisdom.\n\nNúmenor, which had been raised up by Ulmo, was shaped like a star upon\nthe ocean, and was in between Aman and Middle-earth. These Edain reached\nthe island in the year 32 S.A.. Elros, the brother of Elrond, was their\nfirst king.\n\n\nPhysical Characteristics\n\nBeing descendants of the Edain, the men of Númenor were well bred.\nExceptionally strong individuals were legendary.\n\nMost had dark hair, however lighter hairs (blondes) did exist. They were\nalso on average very tall; with Six foot, four inches being the average\namong them. Many far exceeded such height; Elendil himself being\nnicknamed “_ELENDIL THE TALL_” being over seven feet high. One\ncharacteristic that set them apart from typical men was their ages.\nNúmenóreans were not immortal as the Elves or Ainur, however in\ngratitude in their service during the War of the Wrath, they were\nblessed with extended lifespans averaging over 300 years. Bloodlines\nfrom the House of Elros could live for over 400-500. They aged slower\nthan their typical counterparts.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFrom the start, the friendship of the Númenóreans was between the\nDúnedain of the West and the Eldar of Eressëa. The white swan ships of\nthose Eldar brought many gifts to the Númenóreans: birds, trees, herbs,\nand more. Unfortunately, as time progressed, the kings of Numenor began\nto envy the Eldar for their immortality, and a fear of death infected\nthe island. Later on, kings fell dead, decrepit and witless, as they\nhopelessly clung to their lives. Thus faded the bliss of the\nNúmenóreans, if not their power. They had sailed the earth to the East\nin their wooden ships, and even glimpsed from their tall ship prows the\nGates of Morning, in the eastern continent. They founded many colonies\nin Mortal Lands, north and south, and there they ruled. With the gradual\ncreation of a colonial empire, the pride of the Kings grew. The old\ncustoms were for the most part abandoned; those that were kept were kept\nout of fear of the Valar. Most of the Númenóreans distanced themselves\nfrom the Eldar, and towards the end they persecuted any who were in\nfellowship with them. The 25th King, and also the last, Ar-Pharazôn, was\nmade angry by the reemerging Sauron in Mordor. The King sent a vast\narmy, so large and imposing that Sauron found himself deserted by his\nown armies, not a single large battle fought. But what Sauron could not\ncrush with his armies, he would manipulate with cunning mind and\nhoneyed-tongue. He prostrated himself before Pharazôn, and was taken\nprisoner. In less than three years, the Dark Lord had gone from\ntop-priority prisoner to the King's greatest councilor. All save one\n(Lord Amandil of Andúnië) of the Royal Council fawned on Sauron.\n\nAfter many years, the king felt the shadow of death near, and Sauron,\never the opportunist, seized his chance. He told the aging king of “The\nGiver of Freedom and Life” Melkor, behind closed doors. The king,\ndesperate to escape death, turned to the worship of the Dark. At\nSauron's urging, a great temple was built, and the tree Nimloth was cut\ndown, though not before Isildur, Amandil's grandson, escaped with a\nfruit of the tree. In the year 3310 SA, Sauron urged Pharazôn to take\nwhat the king desired for so long, the immortality of Aman. In 9 years,\na vast fleet was made ready, and Pharazôn, almost wavering, boarded his\nflagship, Alcarondas, and set sail. 39 days later, Numenor met with\napocalypse. The king had landed at Aman, and the Valar had ceded\nguardianship of Arda to Eru. Eru tore Aman away from the world, and\nformed the flat disc of Arda into a globe.  Númenor\nwas flooded, and its proud towers and walls crumbled. Sauron was taken\nunawares, and his last fair form was destroyed, and “as a gale” he\nescaped. Not all the Númenóreans were killed, however. Nine ships, led\nby Elendil son of Amandil escaped to the North of Middle-earth, and\nthere founded the kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor. The race of Black\nNúmenórean colonists existed far away in Harad still, as well as the\nrest of the Númenóreans' colonies.",

    "text": "The BLACK NÚMENÓREANS were a fallen group of Númenóreans who were\ndescended from those loyal to the Númenórean crown but opposed to the\nValar and relations with the Elves. They listened to the words of\nSauron. Soon they were corrupted by him, and would come to worship the\nDarkness and Morgoth.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nSecond Age\n\nOrigins\n\nAs the power and knowledge of the Númenóreans grew throughout the course\nof the Second Age, they became increasingly preoccupied with the limits\nplaced on their contentment in the world - and eventually their power -\nby mortality, the purpose of which they began to question.\n\nAs time went on they began to fear death more and more and ultimately\nwished to escape it. So the Númenóreans became envious of the immortal\nElves (the Eldar), whom they had come to physically resemble as part of\ntheir reward from Ilúvatar for having been their allies. The Eldar\nsought ever to remind the Men of Númenor however, that death was a gift\nfrom Ilúvatar to all Men, and to lose faith in Ilúvatar would be\nheretical.\n\nNevertheless, after SA 2221, when Tar-Ancalimon became King of Númenor.\nThe 'King's Men' therefore became increasingly predisposed to the\ncorruption of Sauron after he came to Númenor.\n\nEventually, in Númenor's last years, its hugely powerful but elderly\nKing Ar-Pharazôn, who had become “frightened of old age” (_Letters_,\nno.156), was persuaded by Sauron that Ilúvatar was a lie invented by the\nValar, and seduced him. Within Númenor, the majority immediately\nfollowed suit, and this worship quickly passed across the ocean when\nthey sailed eastwards from Númenor, to most of Númenor's colonies in\nMiddle-earth where the group started in proper.\n\nThe group thrived in Middle-earth, particularly in Umbar after the\ndestruction of Númenor. They continued to oppose The Faithful, from\nwhich came the Kings of Arnor and Gondor, the Black Númenóreans remained\nloyal towards Sauron.\n\nThree of the Ringwraiths can be considered among the first and most\npowerful Númenóreans who were corrupted by Sauron, 1000 years before the\nDownfall: they served Sauron, being enslaved to his will, having become\nso because of their lust for power or knowledge.\n\nThese sacrilegious 'black arts' and 'follies', which arose as a\nconsequence of their worship of 'The Dark' and Melkor, marked the final,\nirrevocable division between the 'King's Men' and the minority known as\nthe 'Faithful' Númenóreans, or the 'Elendili', who kept to their old\nfaith in Ilúvatar. They were also presumably the earliest culture traits\nof those who became known afterwards as Black Númenóreans.\n\nAfter the Fall of Númenor\n\nFor many centuries after the Downfall, descendants of the 'King's Men'\nheld onto colonies in Middle-earth, what became the most northerly and\nfamous of their Realms in Exile, Umbar.\n\nMost of those few Númenóreans who had never disavowed the Eldar, and had\nalways remained true to their belief in Ilúvatar, also survived the\ndestruction of their homeland, and they established their own Realms in\nExile north of Umbar, in familiar and friendly colonies. The Faithful\nNúmenóreans saw their southern counterparts as renegades. The Black\nNúmenóreans held a similarly low opinion of 'The Faithful' and their\ndescendants.\n\nOnly two Black Númenórean lords are named from the time of the late\nSecond Age: Herumor and Fuinur. Like all Black Númenóreans and 'King's\nMen' before them, Herumor and Fuinur desired power over men of other,\n lesser races, and they “rose to (great)\npower amongst the Haradrim”, the peoples neighbouring Umbar. Their fate\nis unknown, but they were likely defeated along with Sauron at the War\nof the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.\n\nThird Age\n\nThe Black Númenórean style of rule was no doubt tyrannical, but may also\nhave involved a tradition of duumviracy, at least in Umbar, whose lords\nare usually paired when mentioned; Herumor/Fuinur for example, were\nprobably rulers of Umbar, as much later Angamaitë/Sangahyando were.\nWhatever political system was in place, however, the Black Númenóreans\ndid not govern effectively.\n\nThe triumph of the Last Alliance marked the decline of the Black\nNúmenórean race and the end of their racial superiority. Nevertheless,\nthe Black Númenórean elite survived at least in Umbar for over a\nthousand years after Númenor's fall, maintaining much influence in\nHaradwaith. As late as Angamaitë for example, even after being exiled\nfrom their homeland for nearly a century.\n\nBlack Numenoreans in the 3rd age eventually joined The Witch King of\nAngmar in his conquests of Arnor. The fate of the Black Numenoreans of\nAngmar is unknown, but it's most likely they either all died or\ndisbanded after the Battle of Fornost.\n\nThe Black Númenóreans did not use Westron, but probably retained their\nold tongue Adûnaic, speaking a dialect of it. (In The Notion Club\nPapers, part of Sauron Defeated, Arundel Lowdham cited two descendants\nof classical Adûnaic. One of these must have been Westron, the other the\ntongue of the Black Númenóreans (Black Adûnaic?).\n\nThe Black Númenóreans are absent from recorded history after their\ndefeat by Ciryaher in TA 1050, but a  population of sorts must have survived somewhere at least\nuntil the end of the Third Age, as the Mouth of Sauron, who mocked the\narmy of King Elessar in front of the Black Gate was described both as a\nBlack Númenórean and “Renegade”, which is presumably the term used by\nthe Free Peoples of that time to describe all folk of similar ancestry.\n\nIn one of his letters, Tolkien wrote that Queen Berúthiel, wife of\nGondor's King Tarannon Falastur was a Black Númenórean, from a Black\nNúmenórean realm he describes as “the inland city” somewhere south of\nUmbar. This was a loveless union, and was presumably a political\naccommodation: that such arrangements were possible implies the\nexistence at that time of more Gondor-friendly Black Númenóreans than\nthe much later Mouth of Sauron.",

Far Harad was\nlocated south of Near Harad.\n\nThe majority of the Near Harad was a desert, described by Gollum as\nwhere the “_yellow face is bright and terrible_”. In the southeast of\nthe Near Harad, a natural gulf fed far into the landmass, and a large\nriver flowed inland from there to the northwest, later forking. One\nbranch of the river flowed westwards towards Umbar, the other branch\nflowed northeast. Neither the gulf nor the rivers were given names by\nTolkien.

All the Minyar and most of the Tatyar and\nNelyar were persuaded and followed Oromë into the west on the Great\nJourney. The remainder of the Tatyar and Nelyar remained suspicious of\nthe Lords of the west, seeing them only in their wrath, or they simply\nrefused to depart from their own lands, and spread gradually throughout\nthe wide lands of Middle-earth. They were after known in Quenya, the\nlanguage of the Eldar that eventually reached Valinor, by the name\n_Avari_, meaning “the Unwilling”, because they refused the summons.\n\nHaving never come to Valinor, the Avari remained wild folk, dwellers of\nforests. Little is known of them, as they do not appear in any of the\ntales, save some references to Avari creeping in the south of Beleriand\nin the First Age. Some of them merged with the Nandor and Sindar in\nEriador and the Vale of Anduin. Also, it is speculated that the Dark\nElves were the first other sentient race encountered by the race of Men\nduring their infancy. The Dark Elves probably taught them many of the\nbasic crafts of civilization, though the craft of the Eldar surpassed\nthat of the Avari even more than that of the Avari surpassed primitive\nMen.\n\nIn _The War of the Jewels_, names of six tribes of Avari in their own\nlanguages are given, all being cognates of the Quenya word Quendi (_the\nSpeakers_): KINDI, CUIND, HWENTI, WINDAN, KINN-LAI, PENNI. They are the\nonly certain Avarin words ever mentioned in the published Middle-earth\nmaterial. It is speculated however that Dorwinion was an Avarin land,\nwith WINION carrying the meaning of “Wine”.\n\nThe Silmarillion contains a suggestion that orcs may be descended from\nAvarin elves captured and corrupted by Melkor.\n\nEöl was called the 'Dark Elf' for he shuns the daylight, preferring to\nstay within the dark woods of Nan Elmoth and walk under the moon and\nstarlights but he is not of Avari origin for he is a kin of Thingol. His\nroots lies with the Teleri, who did not go to Aman, later called the\nSindarin under the rule of Thingol and Melian the Maia.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn older versions of the legendarium, the name _Avari_ was originally\nthat of the later Eldar, then meaning “those that departed”.\n\nIn other, relatively late writings, a brief idea was that the Avari did\nnot come from the three clans, but from two other clans, led by Nurwë\nand Morwë. This idea was later dropped. In the final conception, the\nelves were divided into three tribes."

    "text": "_THE LETTERS OF J. R. R. TOLKIEN_ (ISBN 0-618-05699-8) is a collection\npublished in 1981 of 354 selected letters written by J.R.R. Tolkien over\nthe course of his lifetime, which were edited where necessary by\nTolkien's biographer Humphrey Carpenter with the help of his son\nChristopher Tolkien. The selection contains 354 letters dates between\nOctober 1914 when Tolkien was an undergraduate at Oxford and August 29\n1973 four days before his death.\n\nThe book is now published by George Allen and Unwin (UK) and Houghton\nMifflin (US).\n\n\nFormation of the Book\n\nHumphrey Carpenter first collected and transcribed all the letters and\nmade the initial selection based upon that. Then Christopher Tolkien\ncommented upon his work and made various suggestions for changes, which\nwhere then discussed among them and adopted with various emendations.\nThey then found it necessary to reduce the text quite severely for\nconsideration of space. Humphrey then proposed the initial cuts on which\nChristopher again made various suggestions after which they came up with\na final procedure which was needed in order to make this collection\nhappen. The collection of letters therefore reflects Humphrey tastes and\njudgement more then that of Christopher. Even though it is still their\njoined work.\n\n\nContents of the Collection\n\n-   Introduction\n-   Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien\n-   Notes\n-   Index\n\n\nTypes of Letters\n\nThe 354 letters can be roughly divided into four categories:\n\n-   Personal letters to his family, namely to his wife Edith Tolkien,\n    his son Christopher Tolkien and all his other children and even some\n    grandchildren.\n-   Letters concerning his career as a professor of Anglo-Saxon\n-   Letters send to his publishers Allen & Unwin explaining his often\n    continued failing to meet deadlines and other topics related to\n    publishing a book and\n-   Letters about Middle-earth, this category is for obvious reasons the\n    most interesting to Tolkien fans as it provides a lot of information\n    about Middle-earth which at the time of publishing could not\n    anywhere else in the then published works by Tolkien himself and his\n    then posthumously published work by his son Christopher.\n\nInteresting examples\n\nIn letters 29 & 30, we find out that a German translation of _The\nHobbit_ was being negotiated in 1938. The German firm inquired whether\nTolkien was of 'arisch' (Aryan) origin. Tolkien was infuriated by this,\nand wrote two letters as a response. In the first one Tolkien apparently\nrefused to give any declaration whatsoever of his origin and in the\nsecond one he proudly protested on the inquiry and, among other things,\nreplied that “... I regret that I appear to have _no_ ancestors of that\ngifted  people”. He gave his editor the choice on which reply to\nuse. This second letter is the only one preserved and it is probable\nthat the first one was sent."

    "text": "DUNLENDINGS, also known as\nWILDMEN OF DUNLAND, were the people of Dunland. They were known as a\nfierce culture of Men who sought vengeance on the people of Rohan who,\nas Saruman rightly said, drove them into the mountains. In _The Two\nTowers_, Saruman used their anger to manipulate and convince them to\ndestroy the land of Rohan during the War of the Ring. He sends them\nacross Rohan, burning and looting the land.\n\nDunlending Wildmen come from the land of Dunland. When looting Rohan\nearlier in the Third Age, they are led by a Dunlending named Wulf son of\nFreca.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nIn the years of the Second Age before the Númenóreans settled in\nMiddle-earth, the tribal Hill-men inhabited the lands west and south of\nthe Misty Mountains, as far down as the valleys surrounding the White\nMountains.\n\nWary of the men who came out of the west, they came to fear and hate\nthem. They were hunted and persecuted in such numbers that they had\ndwindled by the start of the Third Age. At this time they had come to\ncongregate in the valleys of the White Mountains and the grassy plains\nof Dunland, which lay west of the Misty Mountains between Moria and\nIsengard; a few went north, and became the ancestors of the Men of Bree.\nDunland then became the area most populated by these men, who came to be\ncalled Dunlendings.\n\n\n\nWhen Eorl and his people were granted Calenardhon --- Rohan, as it would\nlater be known --- in TA 2510, they drove the Wild Men from their new\nlands, earning their bitter hatred and enmity. The Wild Men were also\ndriven from the White Mountains by the Men of Gondor. During the next\nfive hundred years these shorter, dark-haired warriors made frequent\nattacks upon the outlying settlements of Rohan, exacting revenge upon\nthe usurpers, whom they called “straw-heads” because of the high number\nof blond warriors among them.\n\nAs a consequence, Rohan maintained patrols and garrisons to the west of\nthe Fords of Isen to try to limit the number of raids, although these\npatrols had virtually disappeared under Wormtongue's stewardship, to the\npoint where Saruman's forces could make incursions almost at will.\n\nYet not everybody took against the Wild Men. At some point near the end\nof the thirtieth century of the Third Age, Saruman made contact with\nthem and swayed them to his side by playing on their resentment and\nhatred of those who had taken what was theirs.\n\nSaruman welcomed to Orthanc a large warband of these Dunlendings.\nSaruman evidently convinced them that they could reclaim what had been\ntaken, and during the early part of TA 3019, a fearsome raiding force\ncomprising Dunlendings, Orcs and Uruk-hai left Isengard and began\nravaging the western settlements of Rohan. Previous attacks by Orcs and\nUruk-hai had killed many Rohirrim at the Fords of Isen, so there were no\nwarriors to defend against the surprise attack.\n\n\n\nMany people of Rohan were killed in these attacks, but the raiders never\nmade it across the country to Edoras; it is fair to assume that they\nencountered one or more Éoreds, companies of mounted warriors, who would\nhave been patrolling the interior. After the defeat of Isengard at the\nBattle of the Hornburg, the Rohirrim spared the surviving Dunlendings\nand used them as workmen to repair the broken walls of the Hornburg.\n\nThe Rohirrim's mercy surprised the Dunlendings, as Saruman had convinced\nthem the Rohirrim would slaughter them all if given the chance. When\nGandalf, Frodo Baggins, Sam Gamgee, Merry Brandybuck, and Pippin Took\nwere traveling through Dunland on their way back towards the the Shire,\nthe Dunlendings in that area hid from them. After the War of the Ring,\nthe Dunlendings sent ambassadors to the court of King Aragorn, thus\nfinally began peace and diplomacy between Gondor and Rohan with the\nDunlending realms.\n\n\n\n\nCulture\n\nThe Dunlendings were hill-folk used to living in harsh conditions, often\nseen in leather garb and fur cloaks. They may have been related to the\nSnowmen of Forochel in the north. They were a tough, hardy people, big\nand powerful with long, unkempt hair and beards. The Dunlendings,\nbecause they lived in the hilly and forested area of Dunland, most\nlikely hunted, foraged, and fished for food, with agriculture being a\nlesser form of food production.\n\nThe Dunlendings, due to their way of life, probably were very skilled\nwith bows. Dunlendings are also described as using cavalry at the Fords\nof Isen. Most Dunlendings probably fought, however, on foot, with long\nspears, axes and other melee weapons (as with most self-arming forces,\nswords were expensive and therefore a rarity).  Armour for most soldiers\nwas light, but well-off warriors and chieftains likely made use of\nchainmail and were clad similarly as their Rohirrim counterparts.\n",

They were added to the number of High Elves, and they\nshared the lands with the Dwarves.\n\nThe best known Wood-elves are the Elves of the Woodland Realm in\nNorthern Mirkwood and Lothlórien. In the First Age the elves of\nOssiriand, the Laiquendi, were also referred to as Wood-elves.\n\nSilvan Elves were of Nandorin descent but they were mainly governed by\nSindar and Noldorin rulers. Examples of such rulers were Thranduil, the\nKing of the Woodland Realm in Northern Mirkwood, Amdír and his son,\nAmroth, who ruled over Lothlórien, and Celeborn, who too ruled over\nLothlórien with his wife Galadriel who was a Ñoldor elf.\n\nSilvan Elves were considered to be less wise than other Eldar, but were\nmore wise than men. Some of them were almost indistinguishable from the\nAvari, those who never joined the Great Journey.\n\nMirkwood\n\nThe Silvan Elves of Mirkwood (formerly known as Greenwood the Great)\nwere known to be distrustful of Dwarves but friendly to Men, with whom\nthey trade. Mirkwood had been called Greenwood the Great until around\nthe year TA 1050, when the shadow of the Dark Lord Sauron fell upon it,\nand men began to call it Mirkwood. During his journey to the Lonely\nMountain, Bilbo Baggins had to rescue the Dwarves of Thorin II\nOakenshield's company from these Elves. These Elves were also one of the\narmies in the Battle of the Five Armies.\n\nLegolas of the Fellowship of the Ring, although he lived among them and\npresented himself as one of the Silvan folk, was not one of them. As a\nson of the Elven-king Thranduil, who had originally come from Doriath,\nLegolas was actually at least half of Sindarin heritage on his father's\nside (his mother's identity is unknown, though it is likely she was of\nSilvan background). This was complicated by the fact that a small\nminority of Sindarin Elves ruled the predominantly Silvan Woodland Realm\nof Northern Mirkwood, a minority to which Legolas belonged. The Sindarin\nminority in that realm, who should have been nobler and wiser than the\nSilvan Elves, could be seen as having “gone native” at the end of the\nFirst Age after Morgoth was defeated and all the grand elf kingdoms of\nBeleriand were destroyed.\n\nIn the cartoon version of _The Hobbit_, they have been depicted as\nhaving green skin and brown clothes which were very primitive in\ncomparison to the other elves portrayed in the movie.\n\n\n\nLórien\n\nThe Silvan Elves of Lórien were known as part of the Galadhrim,\nliterally “tree-folk”. However, the Galadhrim of Lorien also included a\nmixture of elves of Nandor, Noldor, and Sindar descent. Galadriel was of\nNoldor descent, being the daughter of Finarfin, while Celeborn was of\nSindarin descent of the Kingdom of Doriath. At the time of the War of\nthe Ring they spoke an accent or dialect of Sindarin which had changed\nso much that Frodo Baggins, who spoke Sindarin, could not understand\nthem. Additionally, few Elves of Lórien could speak Westron, so that\nHaldir, one of the few that could, had to accompany them on their way to\nCaras Galadhon. Haldir has been speculated to be a Sindarin Elf, but\nthere is no absolute evidence to confirm this. The only evidence is that\nhe shares the white blond hair of Thranduil and Legolas, who themselves\nare Sindarin."

As Úmanyar, they,\nlike the Sindar, began the Great Journey but did not complete it. In the\nThird Age, most remaining Silvan Elves lived either in Lothlórien or the\nWoodland Realm.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOrigin\n\nThe Silvan Elves were of Nandorin background, descended from the\nfollowers of Lenwë, who were fascinated by the landscape East of the\nMisty Mountains and afraid to attempt to cross them. They thus abandoned\nthe Great Journey, choosing instead to remain in those wide forests,\nwhere they became a scattered people.\n\nLittle is known of the wanderings of the Nandor, save that they spread\nthroughout the Vales of Anduin over a period of many centuries, some\nfollowing the Great River southward, eventually settling at the Mouths\nof Anduin or instead turning north again into Eriador, where eventually\nDenethor gathered as many as he could and crossed the Blue Mountains\ninto Beleriand. These were later known as the Green-Elves of Ossiriand,\nand were welcomed by Thingol as long lost kin.\n\nSome of the Nandor however stayed in the forested Vales, and these would\nbecome the Silvan Elves - hidden away in their woodland fastnesses and\nwere to their estranged kin hardly distinguishable from the Avari, and\nindeed sometimes living in friendship with them. Their language had\ndiverged to such an extent that it was barely intelligible to the Sindar\nand Noldor when these met the Silvan Elves again in the Second Age,\nthough the languages were found to be obviously related. It was not\nuntil this renewed contact between the kindreds and the guidance of the\nSindar and Noldor that the Silvan Elves again became an organised people\nand increased in wisdom. This however also led to the Silvan tongue\nbeing largely forgotten, Sindarin instead becoming the primary spoken\nlanguage by the end of the Third Age, with the Silvan dialects only\nsurviving in several names of places and persons. \n\nThe renewed contact was caused by the destruction of Beleriand after the\nWar of Wrath, for when the Second Age was young, the Silvan Elves\nwelcomed those survivors of the calamity who rather than crossing the\nSea rejoined their kindred east of the Misty Mountains. Indeed soon\nmany of the Silvan Elves came to be ruled by these Sindar refugees,\nprimarily in Lothlórien and the Woodland Realm.\n\nThe Woodland Realm\n\nThe primarily Silvan Elves of Mirkwood were known to be distrustful of\nDwarves but friendly to Men, with whom they traded. Mirkwood had been\ncalled Greenwood the Great until around the year TA 1050, when the\nshadow of the Dark Lord Sauron fell upon it, and men began to call it\nMirkwood. During his journey to the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo Baggins had\nto rescue the Dwarves of Thorin II Oakenshield's company from these\nElves. These Elves sent hosts to both the War of the Last Alliance\nand the Battle of the Five Armies.\n\nLegolas of the Fellowship of the Ring, although he lived among them was\nnot truly one of the Silvan folk. As a son of the Elven-king Thranduil,\nwhose father Oropher had originally come from Doriath, Legolas was\nlikely actually at least half of Sindarin heritage on his father's side\n(his mother's identity being unknown).\n\nIt is important to note that while by the end of the Third Age, Sindarin\nhad become the primary language of the Woodland Realm, Silvan being\nalmost completely forgotten, that in the early years of the Sindarin\nrule over the Silvan Elves here, the Sindar for a time “deliberately”\nadopted the language and customs of the Silvan Elves, as “they wished to\nreturn to the simple life natural to the elves before the invitation of\nthe Valar had disturbed it”. \n\nLórien\n\nThe Silvan Elves of Lórien were the larger part of the Galadhrim or the\nTree-people, who were a mixture of elves of Nandor, Noldor, and Sindar\ndescent. Most of the Sindar that came to Lórien were refugees from\nBeleriand, arriving early in the Second Age, and the Sinda Amdír became\nthe King of Lórien. After Amdír was killed in the Battle of Dagorlad,\nhis son Amroth became King.\n\nAfter the destruction of Eregion, they were joined by many Sindarin\nspeaking Noldor, led by Galadriel and Celeborn, who fled to Lórien\nthrough Moria. Galadriel was of Noldor descent, being the daughter of\nFinarfin, while Celeborn was of Sindarin descent of the Kingdom of\nDoriath. When Amroth was lost in the Third Age, Galadriel and Celeborn\nbecame known as the Lady and Lord of Lórien, but neither of them took\nthe vacant Kingship.\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring they spoke an accent or dialect of\nSindarin which had changed so much that Frodo Baggins, who spoke some\nSindarin, could not understand them. Additionally, few elves of Lórien\ncould speak Westron, so that Haldir, one of the few that could, had to\naccompany them on their way to Caras Galadhon.\n"

    "text": "BELEGAER, also known as the SUNDERING SEAS or the GREAT SEA, was the sea\nof Arda that which lay west of Middle-earth.\n\nThe full extent of Belegaer after the Akallabêth is never made clear,\nbut it reached far enough to the north that parts were covered in ice,\nand far down into the heats of the south. Before the Second Age, the\nBelegaer stretched from the Gap of Ilmen in the far north, to where it\nconnected to Ilmen and froze in the far south. Belegaer was more narrow\nin the north than in the south, with its widest part located near the\nGirdle of Arda.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the Change of the World\n\nBefore Melkor's destruction of the Two Lamps, the Belegaer did not exist\nas there was only a great land mass and Almaren in the Great Lake. After\nwhich, the Belegaer began as a large body of water lying between Aman\nand Middle-earth. It remained unchanged until the War for Sake of the\nElves during the Years of the Trees, when the Belegaer grew wider and\ndeeper and less evenly displaced. After the war, Ulmo pulled the willing\nElves on the isle of Tol Eressëa across the Belegaer to their new home\nin Aman.\n\nThe continent of Aman, the home of the Valar, formed the western edge of\nBelegaer. Before the ruin of Beleriand at the end of the First Age, the\nsea was narrow and covered with ice in the north, forming the harsh\nstrait of Helcaraxë. The rebelling Ñoldor fleeing Valinor crossed to\nMiddle-earth by ship and by way of the dangerous ice crossings on the\nHelcaraxë. Fëanor's host crossed by ship along the coasts while\nFingolfin's host made the difficult journey, coming up from Aman along\nthe shoreline and across the ices of the Helcaraxë.\n\nWhen the Valar declared war on Morgoth's tyranny in Middle-earth, the\nhost was ferried across the Belegaer by the Swanfleet's of the Falmari.\nAfter the War of Wrath, the Belegaer was widened again by the drowning\nof the Beleriand in Middle-earth. The Helcaraxë in the north was\nremoved, ending all land access to the Undying Lands.\n\nAfter the Changing of the World\n\nDuring the Akallabêth in the later Second Age, Eru “bent” the sea and\nmade the world round. Aman was removed from the world to another realm\nin Eä which only Elves and a chosen few could find, who would travel the\nStraight Road to Valinor. Now mortal mariners traveling into west\nsearching for the summit of Meneltarma, said to be in the middle of sea\nfound neither the summit or Aman only the New Lands set in the far\nwest.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Belegaer_ is of the Sindarin words 'beleg' which meant 'mighty' and\n'aer' or e_är_, meaning 'sea' (which is also present in the name\n_Eärendil_). The Quenya name of Belegaer, never used in published\nwriting, is _Alatairë_.\n\n\nNotable features\n\nIslands\n\n-   Tol Eressëa\n-   Enchanted Isles seaward of Tol Eressëa\n-   Númenor (Second Age only)\n-   Tol Morwen\n-   Tol Fuin\n-   Himling\n-   Balar (First Age only)\n-   Tolfalas, in the Bay of Belfalas\n\nBodies of water\n\n-   Bay of Eldamar\n-   Bay of Balar (First Age only)\n-   The Great Gulf (First Age only)\n-   Firth of Drengist (First Age only)\n-   Ice-Bay of Forochel (after First Age)\n-   Gulf of Lune (after First Age)\n-   Bay of Belfalas (after First Age)",

For many ages they grew peacefully, but in\nMiddle-earth at the beginning of the Ages of the Stars there came among\nthe trees great spirits later known as Ents. These protectors appeared\nbecause many other races in that time came into the world and Yavanna\nfeared that the forests would be destroyed. So through the Ages of the\nStars and Sun, the Ents walked the forests, and in time it is said some\nEnts became more tree-like and the ancient trees became more Ent-like\nand limb-lithe. Like Ents, they learned the Art of Speech. Whether tree\nor Ent in the beginning, by the Third Age of the Sun they were a race\napart, referred to as _Huorns_.\n\nThe Huorns mostly stood as dark trees in the deepest forests, gnarled\nand unmoving, yet watchful. When aroused in wrath they moved swiftly as\nif wrapped in shadows, falling on foes with deadly and merciless\nstrength.\n\nThe tale of the War of the Ring tells of how, with the Ents, the Huorns\nmarched on Isengard like a great forest, and how, under the direction of\nthe Ents, they exterminated the entire Orc legion in the Battle of the\nHornburg.\n\nHuorns were ancient and long-brooding, and some were said to be\nblack-hearted and rotten. At least one such sentient tree spirit\ninhabited the Old Forest by the banks of the Withywindle River, who was\ncalled Old Man Willow. As the Old Forest and Fangorn were the last\nremnants of the most ancient forests in Middle-earth, Old Man Willow\nwished to prevent further inroads into his realm. He held all the Old\nForest in an enchantment by the power of his song and led all travellers\nto him, where with his limb-lithe roots and branches he consumed them.\n\nIn _The Two Towers,_ the Huorns are witnessed to march to Isengard with\nthe Ents. After Isengard is harrowed of its orcs, most of the Huorns\nchased and killed them after the Battle of the Hornburg. After this\nbrief appearance, the Huorns went back into the forests. The tactics\nused by the Huorns were quite effective, as they only attacked when all\nthe enemy Orcs would be in their midst, denying the orcs chance of\nescape. It is notable that Huorns seemed to have the ability to cloak\nthemselves in shadows, becoming almost undetectable at night."

They had\nto cross the Helcaraxë in the north, and lost a large number of people\nthere. When asked about the course of action they would take to\ntransport the rest of the exiles, Fëanor ordered the burning of the\nships.\n\nMorgoth wasted no time attacking the exiles, which were vastly superior\nto them in spite of their small number and unprepared state. Fingolfin\nand his followers arrived at the same time as the Moon first rose, and\nthey mainly settled in Hithlum.\n\nThe Exiles set up kingdoms in various places and joined others.

These\nelves passed westward into the Beleriand over the Blue Mountains and\ncame to reside in Ossiriand, the _Land of Seven Rivers,_ and were quite\nsecretive there.\n\n\nCulture\n\nThe Laiquendi had vast knowledge of nature and preferred living in\nforests besides waterfalls and streams, probably living off of simple\nhunting and gathering. They made no weapons of steel, had only bows and\narrows - which they were experts at handling. They dressed in\nforest-like green attire during the spring and summer months, therefore\nbecoming known as the Green-elves. They were also fond of singing during\nthe daylight hours. Their culture remained unique and distinct for many\nhundreds of years as they were for the most part a simple, peaceful, and\nreclusive people.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Laiquendi can be traced to the Telerin Elves of the host of Olwë,\nwho coming upon the Great River Anduin and seeing the seemingly\nimpassable peaks of the Misty Mountains, forsook the westward journey\nand became a separated people. These Elves followed Lenwë down the banks\nof the Anduin and once again became separated. The fate of many of these\nelves is uncertain; what is certain though is that some wandered into\nEriador making contact with the Dwarves, probably learning from them\nabout the great Sindarin King Thingol ruling peaceful territories in the\nrich lands of the Beleriand, prompting them to cross the Blue Mountains.\nFollowing their King Denethor, they made permanent settlement in the\nOssiriand, which was after named Lindon, or _Land of the singers_ after\nthese elves. They quickly made friends with Thingol, who recognized them\nas long lost kin of old.\n\nMorgoth, returning to Middle-earth with the Silmarils before his\npursuers the Ñoldor, quickly occupied his strongholds of old in the far\nnorth and resumed his plans for conquest. He invaded the Beleriand.\nSeeking aid, Thingol called on the Laiquendi and Denethor answered\nleading an army against their enemy’s eastern host, but were driven off\nand surrounded at Amon Ereb before they could be rescued by Thingol's\narmy. Their simplistic weapons were little to no match for the servants\nand beasts of Morgoth, thus they suffered heavy losses and Denethor was\nslain. Afterwards they became a secretive people never again naming a\nlord or a king and played no further part in the Battles of the\nBeleriand again, until the latter days of Beren and Lúthien.\n\nWhen Menhad begun migrating west looking for new lands, the Laiquendi\nfeared them greatly and hid themselves away threatening to attack them\nif Finrod didn’t lead them away from the Ossiriand. They are not\nmentioned again in the First Age until the later days of Beren and\nLúthien who lived in their lands on Tol Galen between the river Adurant.\nThey had a great respect for them and their friendship with Beren led\nthem to take up arms for one last time when they helped him and his son\nambush the Dwarves who sacked Menegroth. After the destruction of the\nBeleriand, the surviving Laiquendi merged with the Elves of Lindon and\nthe peoples of the Elven realms of Lothlórien and Mirkwood over the next\nfew ages.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_LAIQUENDI_ is a Quenyan word that meant “Green-elves”.

After some time, they were summoned by Oromë to\nlive with the Valar in Aman.

Together with the Nandor and the Sindar, they are called\nthe MORIQUENDI (_Elves of Darkness_) in recognition of the fact that\nthey did not see the light of the Two Trees. While all of the Eldar\ndeparted Middle-earth by the early Fourth Age, it appears that the Avari\nmostly stayed.\n\nEldar\n\nThe ELDAR are those who accepted the summons. Their name, literally\n_Star People_, was given to them by Oromë in their own language. Those\nof the Lindar who undertook the Great Journey were called the Teleri.\n\n-   Those of the Teleri who refused to cross the Misty Mountains, and\n    stayed in the valley of Anduin, are called the NANDOR (_Valley\n    People_).\n    -   Those of the Nandor who left the Anduin under the leadership of\n        Denethor and came to Beleriand are called the LAIQUENDI (_Green\n        Elves_).\n    -   The other Nandor became known as the SILVAN ELVES, living in the\n        forests of Wilderland.

Tolkien.\n\nIt follows, and is always published separately from, Part One.\n\n\nContent\n\n_The Book of Lost Tales_ contains the first versions of the stories\nwhich would later become _The Silmarillion_, and is notable because,\nwhile very primitive in style and content, it is very close to the later\nwork in many ways. Each of the Tales is followed by notes and a detailed\ncommentary by Christopher Tolkien.\n\nWhile many of the names in the book are identical or close to those in\nthe later versions, some of them bear almost no resemblance to their\nfinal forms. J.R.R. Tolkien emended names of characters and places\nrather frequently, sometimes with several new variants (rejected in\nturn) written in a single manuscript. Confusingly, sometimes the name\napplied to one thing is later used to refer to a different thing, the\noriginal use abandoned. As an example, the house of Elves called\n“Teleri” in _The Book of Lost Tales_ is not the same as that in _The\nSilmarillion_ (see Teleri). The original usage of “Teleri” would\neventually change until the name became “Vanyar”. Meanwhile, the house\nof Elves called “Solosimpi” would inherit the name “Teleri”.\n\nThe framework for the book is that a mortal Man visits the Isle of Tol\nEressëa, where the Elves live. In the earlier versions of the “Lost\nTales” this man is named Eriol, of some vague north European origin, but\nin later versions he becomes Ælfwine, an Englishman of the Middle-ages.\n\nThere are more changes visible within the book, and it is not internally\nconsistent, partially because even while still writing it Tolkien began\nrewriting earlier parts as his ideas about the world changed. The Tales\nwere eventually abandoned, but they were resurrected in part as the\n“Sketch of the Mythology” which would become _The Silmarillion_.\n\nFor publication the book was split into two volumes: _The Book of Lost\nTales Part One_ and _The Book of Lost Tales Part Two_, but this is\nsimply an editorial division. Both volumes are comprised of several\n“Lost Tales”, which can be considered as either chapters or simply\n“parts”.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1.  “The Tale of Tinúviel” — the first version of the tale of Beren and\n    Lúthien\n2.  “Turambar and the Foalókë” — the first version of the Túrin saga\n3.  “The Fall of Gondolin” — the full narrative of the Fall of Gondolin\n4.  “The Nauglafring” — a story which was “lost” (in that it never was\n    rewritten in full) and mostly excluded from the later\n    _Silmarillion_.\n5.  “The Tale of Eärendel” — the only full narrative of Eärendil's\n    travels\n6.  “The History of Eriol or Ælfwine and the End of the Tales” — an\n    essay about the changes in the framework, and the “unwritten” tales"

This book\nmentions a few characters excluded elsewhere, including Findis and\nIrimë, the daughters of Finwë.\nThe title of this volume comes from a statement from one of the essays:\n“Just as Sauron concentrated his power in the One Ring, Morgoth\ndispersed his power into the very matter of Arda, thus 'the whole of\nMiddle-earth was Morgoth's Ring'”.\n_Morgoth's Ring_ presents source material and editorial on the\nfollowing:\n#Later 1951 revisions of _The Silmarillion_ showing Tolkien's drastic\nrevisiting and rewriting of his legends.\n\n1.  “Annals of Aman” — Detailed chronology from the creation of the\n    world through the end of the First Age, including an explanation of\n    time reckoning in Valian Years.\n2.  “Laws and Customs among the Eldar” — Several essays and legends on\n    the Eldar, particularly mating and naming customs of the Elves, and\n    Tolkien's conceptions of the soul and body.\n3.  “Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth” — A discussion between two characters,\n    an Elven king Finrod Felagund and Andreth, a mortal woman, about the\n    metaphysical differences between Elves and Edain.\n4.  “Tale of Adanel” — The Middle-earth version of the tale of the\n    original sin.\n5.  “Myths Transformed” — Several fragments concerning Morgoth, Sauron,\n    and the origin of the orcs.\n\nfr:Morgoth's Ring pl:Pierścień Morgotha ru:Кольцо Моргота\n\nMorgoth's Ring Morgoth's Ring"

Although Tolkien abandoned both\nof these before their respective ends, they are both long enough to\noccupy many stanzas, each of which can last for over ten pages.\n\nThe first tale is in alliterative verse, and the second is in rhyming\ncouplets. Both exist in two versions. In addition to these two poems,\nthe book also gives some shorter, soon abandoned poems.\n\nThe first versions of the long lays fit chronologically in with\nTolkien's earliest writings, as recounted in _The Book of Lost Tales_,\nbut the later versions are contemporary with the writing of _The Lord of\nthe Rings_."

    "text": "The_' Haradrim, KNOWN IN WESTRON AS THE Southrons_' and once as the\n“SWERTINGS” by Hobbits, were a race of Men from Harad in the region of\nMiddle-earth directly south of Gondor. A part of the histories of the\nWestlands is given to the fierce people who in the Second and the Third\nAge of the Sun, came from the hot deserts and forests of sunlands, which\nlay in the South of Middle-earth. These people were ruled by many and\nlords, until in time Sauron the Maia corrupted them and called them to\nwar.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the Second Age the Men of Númenor built a great city in the firth\nof Umbar, a vast natural harbour on the southern shores of the Bay of\nBelfalas, eventually turning the city into a fortified citadel from\nwhose gates the Men of Númenor could levy great tributes upon many of\nthe tribes of Harad.\n\nFor many years, the Haradrim were the greatest enemy of Gondor. Several\ntimes, they invaded the north. Finally, the Men of Gondor were able to\ncapture Harad, though it was later freed. During the War of the Ring the\nHaradrim were allied with Sauron. A Haradrim warrior wounded Faramir. At\nthe Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the 18,000 Haradrim were a great\nthreat to the Rohirrim that had come to aid the people of Minas Tirith.\nDuring the onslaught a Haradrim chieftain, who bore the standard of a\nblack serpent on a scarlet field, led the Haradrim cavalry. King Théoden\nof Rohan slew him in single combat.\n\nOnce Sauron was destroyed, the Haradrim, Variags, and Easterlings\ndisbanded from the Black Gates and out of Mordor, and became dispersed.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _HARADRIM_ means “South-people”, from the Sindarin _harad_\n(“south”) and _rim_ (“host, group”).\n\nOther names were SOUTHERNS, SOUTHRONS.\n\n\nTraits and culture\n\nThe Haradrim were bold and grim men, fierce in despair. They were tall\nand dark-skinned with black hair and dark eyes, and for that they were\ncalled SWERTINGS or SWARTHY MEN. The men of Near Harad were\nbrown-skinned, with black hair and dark eyes, while the race known as\n“half-trolls” out of Far Harad had black skin.\n\nMany Haradrim warriors were seen in bright clothing, such as scarlet\nrobes, and were decorated with golden ornaments, such as collars,\nearrings, corsets of overlapping brazen plates; they braided their hair\nwith gold. Some tribes painted their bodies. Scarlet and red was also\nthe color of their banners, tips of their spears, and body paint. Their\nshields were yellow and black with spikes. It is also mentioned that\nat the end of the Second Age some of the Men in the south had weapons of\niron. At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Haradrim bore\nscimitars that glittered like stars.\n\nThe Haradrim had tamed the massive _Mûmakil_ beasts and used them in\nwarfare and, like their masters, were decorated with scarlet and gold.\nThey even strapped towers on their backs, used by Haradrim archers and\nspearmen.\n\nHarad's tribes included into those of Near and Far Harad, although there\nwere many tribes of the Haradrim, often mutually hostile. Some of the\npeoples of Far Harad were organized into kingdoms.\n\nLanguage\n\nTo the Gondorians their voices sounded harsh, like shouts of beasts.\n\nThe only word which is stated to come from a southron language is\n“Mûmak”, the name of the great war-oliphaunts of Harad.\n\nGandalf states that his name in “the south” is “Incánus” thought\n_Inkā-nūsh_ (or possibly _Inkā-nūs_), meaning “North-spy”.\n\nDespite having a meaning in Quenya (“fate”), the name Umbar is said to\nbe adapted from the natives' language and not from Elvish or Adûnaic.\n\n\nEnvironment\n\n\n\nThe lands of the Haradrim lie to the south of Gondor past the river\nPoros. In the land south of Gondor, the sun beat down unrelentingly,\ncooking much of Haradwaith into desert.\n\n\nMilitary Tactics\n\n\n\nThe Haradrim are said to be skilled horsemen, though not near the\nprowess of the Rohirrim. They are known to have mounted champions and\narchers, as well as infantry. Horses fear the Mumakil, and so the\nSouthron forces often rally around them when faced with mounted foes.\n\n\nFuture of Harad\n\nMuch of Harad's impressive army was wiped out on the expanses of\nPelennor Fields, during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. With Sauron\ndefeated, many Harad peoples sent emissaries to the court of King\nAragorn, and peace talks began; however, many other Haradrim tribes\ncontinued hostility with Gondor.\n",

    "text": "RANGERS OF THE NORTH, or simply THE RANGERS, were the northern\nwandering people of Eriador, the last remnant of the Dúnedain of Arnor,\nwho had once peopled the North Kingdom of Arnor. They protected the\nlands they wandered although their secretiveness made other peoples\nconsider them dangerous and distrustful in Bree and the Shire, where\nthey were known as “Watchers”.\n\nThey were grim in appearance and were usually dressed in grey or dark\ngreen, with a cloak-clasp shaped like a 6-pointed star.\n\nThe term 'Rangers of the North' was used most often by those who lived\nin the southern lands of Rohan and Gondor, perhaps to distinguish this\npeople from their distant cousins, the Rangers of Ithilien. Like the\nRangers of the North, these were also Dúnedain, but they belonged to the\nSouth-kingdom of Gondor, and their ancestors had been divided from the\nNorthern Dúnedain for some three thousand years.\n\n\nBackground\n\n The Dúnedain of\nArnor dwindled after the breaking of Arnor into three kingdoms and the\nwars with Angmar. Cardolan and Rhudaur soon fell and only the\npetty-kingdom of Arthedain maintained the noble line of Isildur.\nFinally, that too was destroyed in the Battle of Fornost and Arvedui,\nthe last King of Arthedain was lost in the sea.\n\nArvedui's son and heir, Aranarth claimed the title of the Chieftain, who\nwould rule the remnants of his people. Elrond had in his keeping the\nheirlooms of the house of Isildur: the shards of Narsil, the Star of\nElendil, the Sceptre of Annúminas and later the Ring of Barahir,\nransomed from the Lossoth.\n\nEach of Aranarth's heirs (who, like him, could trace his descent back to\nIsildur himself) would be secretly born and raised in Rivendell.\n\nThe Rangers became a secretive wandering and nomadic people around\nEriador, far from Sauron's spies, little known or remembered, and their\ndeeds were seldom recorded.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Watchful Peace followed the loss of Arnor and after its end, the\nenemies concentrated mostly against Rhovanion and Gondor. During that\ntime, the Rangers fought minor battles and skirmishes against orcs and\nwolves in order to keep the region safe. The hobbits of the Shire\nflourished under their protection.\n\nDuring the rule of Arassuil, the Orcs of the Misty Mountains became more\nbold, daring to invade Eriador. The Rangers fought many battles trying\nto hold them back, but one party managed to reach the Shire, and were\nfought off by a party of brave Hobbits under Bandobras Took in T.A.\n2747. Soon after, the Long Winter arrived and many lives were lost, and\nGandalf and the Rangers had to help the Hobbits of the Shire survive.\n\nIn 2911, during Argonui's rule, the Fell Winter began with the\nBrandywine freezing over. This was a catalyst for White Wolves invading\nEriador from the North which must have harassed the Rangers. In the last\nyear of his reign, great floods devastated Enedwaith and Minhiriath\nleaving Tharbad ruined and deserted. The following years were peaceful\nalthough Arador was killed by hill-trolls and his son Arathorn II was\nkilled while hunting orcs.\n\nArathorn's son, Aragorn II succeeded him, who between 2957 to 2980 took\ngreat journeys, serving in the armies of King Thengel of Rohan, and\nSteward Ecthelion II of Gondor. Many of his tasks weakened Sauron and\nhis allies, and the West endured him during the War of the Ring.\n\nAt that time Aragorn's Rangers were scattered and diminished. When\nHalbarad led a troop of the Rangers into the south to Aragorn's aid in\nthe War, in haste he could muster no more than thirty in this company\nwho fought in the Battle of Pelennor Fields.\n\nAragorn eventually became King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom and the\nRangers became once more a united people under the line of Elendil in\nthe Fourth Age.\n\nFor over a thousand years, the Rangers of the North faithfully preserved\nthe Line of Elendil and the ways of the Dúnedain and the ancient\nheirlooms of the Heir of Isildur such as the Shards of Narsil, Star of\nElendil, Sceptre of Annúminas, and the Ring of Barahir. Like all\nDúnedain, they were very friendly with the Elves, particularly those of\nRivendell, where each heir would be born and raised. They secretly\nguarded and protected Eriador, from spies and invaders, brigands, and\nother worse foes.\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring, the Rangers of the North were led by\nAragorn, future king of the reunited kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor.

The first battle took place on February 25, 3019. The second\nwas on March 2, 3019.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThéodred, son of King Théoden of Rohan, was alerted by his scouts to the\nmustering taking place in Isengard. He manned both sides of the ford and\nwent forward leaving three companies of riders to guard the eastern\nside. Early in the morning, he crossed over to the western side with a\nforce mainly consisting of archers and cavalry. He planned to take the\nforces of Uruk-hai by surprise.\n\nHowever, Saruman had tricked the scouts; his army was already marching\nout to attack the ford. Twenty miles to the north of the ford, Théodred\nencountered the vanguard of the Uruk-hai and quickly cut through their\nlines. He then charged at the main force,\nwhich were prepared for the attack and were stationed behind trenches\nplanted with pikes. Reinforcements came out of Isengard and outflanked\nthe cavalry, nearly surrounding them. Hastily Théodred ordered a\nretreat, but the Uruk-hai could not be shaken off that easily. Grimbold,\nwho was in command of the Rohirrim rearguard, had to cut down their\npursuers many times.\n\nSaruman's eastern force was much smaller but more dangerous. It\ncontained Dunlendings, Warg riders and Uruk-hai. The Rohirrim guard on\nthe eastern side of the ford had been driven into retreat, and their\nattackers recrossed the ford to attack Théodred on both sides. Théodred\nand his men had dismounted on a small islet to cover Grimbold's retreat.\nAt the same time Grimbold's force was being attacked from the western\nside, and as Grimbold looked east, he saw Théodred's force being driven\nfrom the islet to a hill. Grimbold and a few men raced toward Théodred's\nposition. Théodred was cutting his way through the Uruk-hai lines. But\nby the time Grimbold reached him, Théodred had fallen, cut down by a\ngiant Orc. Grimbold slew the Orc and then found himself defending\nThéodred's body from enemies. He himself would have been cut down had it\nnot been for Elfhelm.\n\nElfhelm had been leading four companies towards Helm's Deep, when it was\nreported to him that two Warg riders had been spotted. He rode at full\nspeed to the ford and, seeing the situation, ordered his men to charge.\nBefore long his men held the western side of the ford. They then charged\non the islet. From this surprise attack most of the Uruk-hai retreated\ntoward Isengard. When they reached the islet they found Grimbold\ndefending Théodred's body against two huge Orcs. Elfhelm rushed to his\naid and felled one enemy while Grimbold slew the other.\n\nWhen they lifted Théodred's body, they found he was still alive. He\nlived long enough to say, “Let me lie here -to keep the ford until Éomer\ncomes.” The enemy attack ended by nightfall. The Rohirrim had held the\nford but suffered heavy losses.\n",

Several members of\nthis council would also become prominent members of the Council in the\nThird Age.\n\nDuring the Third Age\n\n The White Council's head\nwas the Wizard Saruman the White, (although Lady Galadriel wished for\nGandalf the Grey to be made the leader of the group).

During this\nmeeting Gandalf suspected Saruman of desiring to have the One Ring, and\nthere was much tension between the two. However, in TA 2939, Saruman\ndiscovered that Sauron's servants were searching the Anduin near Gladden\nFields, and that Sauron therefore had learned where Isildur had died and\nwhere the One Ring might be. Saruman did not inform the Council of this,\nbut when they met again in TA 2941 Saruman finally agreed to an attack\non Dol Guldur because he wanted to prevent Sauron from finding the Ring.\nSauron was driven out of Dol Guldur, only to re-appear in Mordor in\n2951, where he declared himself openly and began gathering power. The\nCouncil last met in TA 2953; at this meeting Saruman falsely claimed\nthat the One Ring has been swept out into the sea. Afterward Saruman\nwithdrew to Isengard, and fortified it.\n"

    "text": "The AINUR, also known as the HOLY ONES, are beings encompassing both the\nValar and the Maiar. They were the first and mightiest beings created by\nEru Ilúvatar in the depths of time before the beginning of the World.\n\nThey were primordial spirits who existed with Ilúvatar, and with him\ncreated the world through the '''Ainulindalë, '''the MUSIC OF THE AINUR.\nAfter the creation of Arda, many of the Ainur descended into it to guide\nand order its growth; of these there were fifteen more powerful than the\nrest. Fourteen of these great Ainur became known as the Valar, or Powers\nof Arda. The fifteenth, Melkor, turned aside from that path and became\nthe first Dark Lord. The many lesser Ainur that accompanied the Valar\ninto Arda are known as Maiar.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOrigin\n\nThe Ainur were the 'offspring of Ilúvatar's thought' and each was given\nunderstanding only of that part of the mind of Ilúvatar from which he or\nshe came. The exception to this was Melkor, a brother in spirit to\nManwë, who later became The Lord of the Valar and he was given some of\nthe parts from which the others had come, but for all his gifts he did\nnot know the full mind of Eru. Melkor and Manwë were the most powerful\nof the Ainur.\n\nThe Ainur were 'kindled with the Flame Imperishable', which can be taken\nto mean that they were granted free will by their Creator. Ilúvatar\ninstructed them in the arts of music, until he brought them together to\nmake the Music of the Ainur: the great song that created the Vision of\nIlúvatar and ultimately the real world. In the beginning of the Music,\nthe Ainur were all in harmony with Eru and one another, but Melkor\nturned instead to his own pride, seeking power for himself and bringing\ndiscord to the Great Music. He later led many of the Maiar astray as\nwell.\n\n\nThe Ainur and the World\n\nThrough the Music of the Ainur, Ilúvatar created a Vision of the World;\nhe showed it to the Ainur, and explained much of its nature and destiny\nto them - the Ainur therefore have much knowledge of the World, but are\nnot themselves omniscient. Ilúvatar then granted the World true being by\ndeclaring “Eä”, causing these visions to come into being. Melkor and\nmany of the other mighty Ainur desired to descend into it and form it in\nreadiness for the coming of the Children of Ilúvatar (that is, Elves and\nMen).  Upon descending into the World, the Ainur became known as the\nValar and the Maiar.\n\nThose Ainur who entered the World and chose to live in it at its\nbeginning remain bound to it until its end. Though Melkor was eventually\nthrown into the Void by the others, he is prophesied to return before\nthe end in the DAGOR DAGORATH, the final battle. Little is known of the\nultimate future of the Ainur, even by themselves, but it is said that\nafter the great battle at the end of the World, they will make a Second,\neven greater Music with the Children of Ilúvatar.\n\n\nThe Line of Melian\n\nAmong the many Ainur who entered the World long ago, there was one of\nthe order of the Maiar named Melian. Alone of all the Ainur, she wedded\none of the Children of Ilúvatar, King Elu Thingol of Doriath, and wove\nthe Girdle of Melian that protected Doriath for many centuries. Through\nher, an essence of the Ainur entered the bloodlines of the Elves and\nMen, passed down through generation after generation, and was still\npresent at the time of the War of the Ring. Elrond was Melian's\ngreat-great-grandson, and Aragorn, too, was her descendant, though\nthrough many more generations than Elrond.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nAINUR is a Quenyan word originating from Valarin and means “Holy ones”.\nIt appears to come from the word AINA, meaning 'holy'. Although the\norigin of the second element '''ur '''is less clear, it is possible\nthere is a link between the word 'Ainur' and the word 'Eru' as the first\nelement 'er' means 'one', though this may not be true as there is no\nfurther elaboration on this.\n\nThe singular form of Ainur is AINU, simply meaning “Holy one”.\n",

    "text": "The DAGOR BRAGOLLACH or BATTLE OF THE SUDDEN FLAME was the fourth of the\ngreat battles of the War of the Jewels. It marked the end of the Siege\nof Angband and beginning of Morgoth's gains against the Elves and Men of\nthe Beleriand.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\n\n\nFor four hundred years after Dagor Aglareb the Ñoldor had managed to\ncontain Morgoth's power inside Angband. Peace and prosperity reigned in\nBeleriand, to the point where green grass grew even to the very doors of\nAngband. The strength of the Elven kingdoms, and that of their Edain\nallies, became such that Fingolfin, High King of the Ñoldor, believed\nthat the siege would last forever. But though the Elves and Edain had\nmanaged to contain Morgoth's forces, it was beyond their power to\nassault Angband or to overthrow the power of Morgoth. As such, the Dark\nLord labored undisturbed in Angband during the siege, breeding countless\nlegions of Orcs and other evil creatures, as well creating the first\nDragon. He intended to use this new, unprecedentedly powerful force to\nutterly destroy those who had opposed him. However, in the furious haste\nof his malice, he decided to strike before his designs were complete,\ncynically underestimating the valor of the Elves, and not accounting for\nthe Edain at all. This haste was credited as the reason why resistance\nagainst Morgoth was able to continue after the conclusion of the\nconflict; for if Morgoth had waited for a short time longer to complete\nthe buildup of his forces, his foes would have been annihilated.\n\nOn a cold winter's night when the Elven watch was at its least vigilant,\nMorgoth sent out rivers of flame and poisonous fumes from Thangorodrim\nand the Iron Mountains. The plains of Ard-galen were consumed by the\nfire and transformed into a barren desert which was renamed\nAnfauglith, “the Gasping Dust”. The Elves had never faced an assault of\nthis sort before, and many perished as they fled from these flames.\nBehind them came the Balrogs, Glaurung the Father of Dragons, and\nlegions of Orcs in such numbers as the Elves had never imagined.\nMorgoth's primary aim was an onslaught so rapid that the various\nkingdoms of the Elves would not be able to consolidate their forces or\ncome to each others aid. And so it was that each of the Elven kingdoms\nhad to fight Morgoth's forces on their own. The Orcs quickly overran the\nhighlands of Dorthonion, and slew Angrod and Aegnor. Maglor's horsemen\nwere burnt alive on the plain of Lothlann, and Maglor's Gap was taken,\ngiving Morgoth an entry into Beleriand. Maglor retreated with heavy\nlosses to Himring, where he helped defend the city of Maedhros. Though\ngrievously besieged, the heavily fortified city did not fall, and\nMaedhros himself accomplished deeds of surpassing valor during the\nfighting.\n\nThe Pass of Aglon was also breached, and Celegorm and Curufin fled north\nof Doriath to Nargothrond. Morgoth's Orcs took the mountain forests of\nMount Rerir, and defiled Lake Helevorn, scattering south through\nThargelion into East Beleriand. Caranthir fled to Amon Ereb, where he\nand Amrod built defenses. From there they slowly freed East Beleriand of\nthe Orcs, while Maglor and Maedhros held the northern border.\nEventually, Maedhros even managed to re-secure the Pass of Aglon,\ndenying the forces of Morgoth continued entry into Beleriand from that\nroute.\n\n\n\nMinas Tirith in the Pass of Sirion in the West under Orodreth held, and\nOrodreth's uncle and Lord Finrod Felagund came north from Nargothrond\nwith a large army. However, they were ambushed by a huge number of\nMorgoth's forces at the Fen of Serech. The Noldor found themselves\ntrapped, and Finrod would have been killed or taken but for a sortie by\nBarahir and his men, who descended from Dorthonion and rescued the Elven\nlord. The cost in lives was heavy, but Finrod escaped the Orcs. In\nprofound gratitude, Finrod gave Barahir his ring, which would become\nknown as the Ring of Barahir, and pledged that he would aid Barahir and\nhis kin in any time of need.\n\nFinrod and his folk fled south to Nargothrond, while Barahir continued\ndefending Dorthonion until both his forces and his people dwindled to\nnothing. The mountain forts of the Ered Wethrin around Hithlum were\nheavily assaulted but managed barely to hold, as the mountains\nthemselves provided protection from the fires Morgoth had released from\nThangorodrim.\n\nThus the Siege was broken, the Sons of Fëanor scattered, and the forces\nof Morgoth roamed at will throughout the north.\n\nWhen Fingolfin, the High King of the Ñoldor, learned of the heavy\ncasualties of so many Ñoldor, he rode in wrath across the dust of\nAnfauglith to Angband and challenged Morgoth to single combat. At the\ndoors of Angband itself, they fought a great duel, and Fingolfin wounded\nMorgoth seven times. Yet, Fingolfin was ultimately no match for the Dark\nLord and was crushed beneath Morgoth's foot, but not before stabbing\nMorgoth in the heel with his last stroke. Thorondor, king of the Great\nEagles, then swooped down and retrieved Fingolfin's body and scarred\nMorgoth's face. Though Morgoth's wounds would never heal and he was left\nwith a permanent limp, Morgoth and his forces were nevertheless\nvictorious.\n\nStill, Morgoth was cautious. For though he had won a great victory, his\nfoes had inflicted upon him loss as great as their own. As his initial\nonslaught had abated, his foes had begun to recover, making small\nadvances into the fringes of the territory he had conquered. He had not\nexpected the Elves to resist him so strongly, and the aid of their Edain\nallies had been a completely unforeseen variable in his plans. As such,\nhe checked his assault and recalled the main host of the Orcs to\nAngband.\n\nTwo years after Morgoth's onslaught abated, the isle of Tol Sirion, held\nby Orodreth brother of Finrod, came under assault by Morgoth's most\nterrible servant, Sauron. His coming caused a dark cloud of fear to grip\nthe hearts and wills of the defenders, and the watchtower of Minas\nTirith upon the isle was taken. This secured for Morgoth the western\npass of the river Sirion. After another five years had passed, Morgoth\nrenewed his assault against Hithlum and very nearly destroyed it.\nFortunately for Fingon, now High King of the Ñoldor, his forces were\nreinforced by a host under the command of Círdan, and the Orcs were\nrepelled.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_DAGOR BRAGOLLACH_ is Sindarin for 'Battle of Sudden Flame'.",

Under the\nleadership of Ingwë, the Vanyar were the first to set forth on the Great\nJourney and the first to reach the shores of Belegaer; they sailed to\nAman on the first voyage of Tol Eressëa and remained there permanently.\n\n\n\nThe Vanyar are the fairest of all the elves hence their name: the FAIR\nELVES. Unlike the others who were attracted to the sea or the building\nand forging of things, the Vanyar culture seemed to revolve about Valar\nand Valinor. This is probably the reason why they choose to stay in\nValinor proper centered around Taniquetil, the seat of the rulers of\nArda, and loved the light of Valinor best of all the other places in\nAman and the wisdom of the Valar, and why they were favored by Manwë and\nVarda and always distrusted Melkor. They are known to have had the\ngreatest skill in poetry of all the Elves, likened to Manwë who loves\nthem for it. Their hair colour was golden and their banners white.\n\nIngwë was their king.\n\n\nHistory\n\nVanyar are descendants of Imin, the first Elf to awake at Cuiviénen, his\nwife Iminyë, and six other pairs of Elves who were awoken by them.\nImin's companions, Tata and Enel, later awoke groups of nine and twelve\npairs respectively, and Imin decided that since his group was now the\nsmallest and each group that he and his companions discovered was larger\nthan the last, he would now choose third rather than first in order to\nmake up the numbers. However, only a further two groups were discovered,\nleaving Imin's group of fourteen by far the smallest of the three Elven\nclans.\n\nWhen the Elves were discovered by Oromë, each clan chose an ambassador\nto return with him to Valinor to verify his claims of its greatness. The\nMinyar (Imin's companions) sent Ingwë. Upon his return, his people were\nswayed by his testimony and adopted him as their king (appropriate, as\nthe name Ingwë means chieftain in Quenya), and he led them with Oromë to\nAman. Ingwë has since been reckoned the High King of all Elves, and\nbecame known as Ingwë Ingweron, the “Chief of Chieftains”, and his\npeople were known by the rest of the Eldar as the Vanyar. In Aman the\nVanyar first dwelt in Tirion. Later, they came to love the full light of\nthe Trees and wandered into Valinor or settled on Taniquetil. He dwells\nwith them on the slopes of Taniquetil, beneath the halls of Manwë.\n\nAfter arriving in Aman, the Vanyar were rarely seen even by other Elves.\nVery few individual Vanyar are named besides Imin, Ingwë, his sister (or\npossibly niece) Indis, and Amarië, who was in love with Finrod Felagund.\n\n☀, Indis, the second wife of Finwë, the High King of the Ñoldor and the\nmother of both Fingolfin and Finarfin, the latter of which founded the\nonly house of Noldorin Elves to sport golden Vanyarin hair. After her\nhusband was killed by Melkor in his attack on Formenos to attain the\nSilmarils , she returned to her people with her daughter Findis.\n\nUnlike the Noldor, the Vanyar loved the light of Valinor so much that\nthey never choose to return to Middle-earth save when many of the Vanyar\nmarched in the War of Wrath with the Host of Valinor. Though they\npreferred the peaceful light of Valinor, the Vanyar were skilled in the\narts of war and were known for their fashioning of spears, thus they\nno doubt fielded a formidable army in the war. Ingwë's son led an armed\nhost of his people from Valinor to fight in the War of Wrath. They\nreturned to Aman, along with most of the Eldar living in the now largely\ndestroyed Beleriand, at the end of the First Age.\n\n\nRelations\n\nGaladriel was the granddaughter of Indis. It is to her Vanyarin blood\nthat Galadriel owes her famous silver-gold hair.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Vanyar_ means 'Fair-ones' in Quenya , referring to their\ngolden hair. The Vanyar often called themselves MINYAR; IPA: ; “Firsts”;\nsingular MINYA; adjectival MINYARIN; ), their ancient name. This ancient\nname does not still refer to any of the Avari who remained in\nMiddle-earth, since all of the Vanyar heeded the call of the Valar to\ncome to Valinor.\n\n\nOther Versions of the Legendarium\n\nIn the earliest versions of Tolkien's mythology (see: _The History of\nMiddle-earth_), they were called INGWI, as they were the people of\nIngwë, the High King of the Elves.\n\n\nGallery\n\nImage:Indis the Fair by vigshane.jpg|Indis the Fair, the wife of Finwë,\nthe first High King of the Ñoldor and Queen of the Ñoldor, by Filat\nImage:Amarie of the vanyar by Filat.jpg|Amarie, the love of Finrod, by\nFilat"

For thousands of years it\nwas separate from the outside world under the rule of King Thingol and\nthe protection of his wife Melian the Maia, until it was drawn into the\nwar against Morgoth and the doom that lay on the Ñoldor, because of the\nOath of Fëanor.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nDoriath was located in the middle of Beleriand, between Ered Gorgoroth\n(Mountains of Terror) from the north and the Andram from south, and\nTalath Dirnen from the west, and Estolad from the east. It was a realm\nof forests about the great river Sirion; within it were the forests\n_Neldoreth_ (also _Taur-na-Neldor_, the northern beech forest), _Nivrim_\n(also West-march, an oak forest), and _Region_ (pronounced Reh-gi-on,\nthe main forest). Additionally, the forests of _Brethil_ and ''Nan\nElmoth ''were considered to be under the influence of Thingol, though\nnot under his direct command and laying outside of the Girdle of Melian.\nEöl the Dark Elf leased Nan Elmoth from Thingol, having paid with the\nsword Anglachel. The People of Haleth, or the Haladin, lived in Brethil\nwith the permission of Thingol. They governed themselves, but cooperated\nwith the march-wardens of Doriath. King Elu Thingol of Doriath, also\nHigh King of the Sindar, saw all of Beleriand as his realm, from the\nGelion to the Belegaer (the Sea).\n\n\nHistory\n\nYears of the Trees\n\nThe Vanyar and Ñoldor had passed by it on the Great Journey, and had\nbeen ferried across on Tol Eressëa by the time the Teleri arrived. Then\ntheir lord Elwë was lost in Nan Elmoth, and when Ulmo returned for them,\na part remained behind. They became known as the Sindar or Grey Elves,\nand when Thingol returned he became their king, ruling from Doriath.\n\nThe forests of Neldoreth and Region were located in the center of\nBeleriand, and were the abode of King Thingol and Melian. Their people\nwere the people of the Teleri who did not heed the call of the Valar to\npass over the sea to Valinor. All the Elves of Beleriand, from the\nshipbuilders under Círdan in the Falas, to the hunters of the Blue\nMountains, held Thingol as their lord. During the First and Second Ages\nof the Chaining of Melkor, Beleriand was peaceful. However, by the end\nof the First Age, Melian forebode that evil was to come, and Thingol\ncalled on the aid of the Dwarves of Belegost to aid in constructing a\ncity-fortress for the protection of his people. They also helped make\nfor them a store of stronger and better weapons that were better able to\ndeal with the Orcs of north. This was built under ground along the\nsouthern side of the River Esgalduin, and was called Menegroth, which\nbecame Thingol's capital.\n\nFor the most part, the Elves lived in scattered bands throughout\nBeleriand, only gathering in larger numbers in Neldoreth and Region\n(together called Eglador), and along the Falas. During the Third Age of\nthe Chaining of Melkor, Thingol proceeded to arm his people with the aid\nof the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost against the continued foreboding\nof Melian.\n\nAfter Melkor's release, his attack on the Two Trees with Ungoliant, and\nflight to Middle-earth, the situation for Beleriand suddenly worsened.\nUngoliant fled south from the Balrogs after her confrontation with\nMelkor, now Morgoth, and was only checked by the power of Melian. Some\ntime after, the forces of Morgoth left the freshly delved Angband and\nassaulted Beleriand from east and west in the First Battle of Beleriand.\nIn the east, King Thingol lead the forces of Beleriand, with the aid of\nDenethor and his Nandor and elves from Ossiriand, and completely\ndefeated the Orcs of the eastern army. Denethor was killed on Amon Ereb,\nand some of his people merged themselves to the Sindarin Elves under\nKing Thingol. Upon returning to Menegroth, Thingol learned that the\nwestern army of Morgoth had overrun the Falas. Thingol recalls all of\nhis people he can into Neldoreth and Region, and Melian puts forth her\npower and rings the region in a girdle of enchantment called the Girdle\nof Melian. At that point, the region formally called Eglador comes to be\nformally known as Doriath, the Guarded Kingdom.\n\nThe First Battle is the only time King Thingol leads his forces into\nbattle outside of his realm for the entirety of the First Age of the\nSun. Afterwards, the Elves of Doriath fight defensively, guarding their\nborders and the important river crossings nearby.\n\nFirst Age\n\n\n\nWhen the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth at the beginning of the First\nAge, Thingol refused to allow them in Doriath, with the exception of the\nchildren of Finarfin, who were related to him by his brother Olwë.\n\nWhen later Men arrived in Beleriand, they were also refused entry, but\nat Finrod's request the Haladin gives his permission for the People of\nHaleth to dwell in Brethil, who ally themselves with Doriath and aid\nthem in its defense.\n\nThroughout the rest of the First Age, while the Noldor fight their wars\nwith Morgoth, Doriath stands inviolate and generally aloof, refusing to\ntake part in the wars. Ultimately, however, King Thingol is pulled into\nthe doom surround the Noldor as was told in the Lay of Leithian, when\nBeren, son of Barahir and lord of the First House of Men, passed through\nthe Girdle as Melian had foretold, and arrived in Neldoreth.\n\nRealizing that his beloved daughter Lúthien had fallen in love with him,\nKing Thingol decreed that he would not allow them to marry unless Beren\nwould undertake a quest to recover a Silmaril from the Dark Lord\nMorgoth, and so begins the Quest for the Silmarils. After the Quest for\nthe Silmaril, the Wolf Carcharoth also breached the Girdle, but Thingol,\nBeren, and Thingol's captains Beleg and Mablung hunted and killed the\nbeast.\n\nAt the end of this, Thingol ended up in possession of one of the\nSilmarils. Beren and Lúthien, wedded together by fate and returning from\nthe dead, left Doriath to live in Ossiriand. After the Nirnaeth\nArnoediad, only three elven kingdoms remained: Nargothrond, Gondolin,\nand Doriath. Nargothrond fell soon after, as told in the _Narn i Chîn\nHúrin_ (Tale of the Children of Hurin).\n\nFearing that the cruel Easterlings would enthrall her only\nson Túrin of Hithlum, Morwen sent him to Doriath where he would be safe\nuntil he came of age, when he fled from the land. Later his mother and\nsister, Morwen and Nienor lived there, until they were lost.\n\nHurin, captured at the Nirnaeth and released from Angband after the\ndeath of his son Turin, recovers the Nauglamir from the ruin of\nNargothrond. Traveling to Doriath, he throws it at the feet of Thingol\nin spite. Melian rebukes him, and Hurin, cured of the madness of Morgoth\nby Melian, lifts up the Nauglamir and presents it to Thingol before\nleaving Doriath, and vanishing from history.\n\nFall of Doriath\n\nHúrin brought the treasure of Nargothrond to Doriath after the fall of\nFinrod's realm, and Thingol enlisted the Dwarves of Nogrod to combine\nthe Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien with the Nauglamir, the Dwarves'\nNecklace. The Dwarves then attacked Thingol and slew him, stealing the\nnecklace, during the first Sack of Doriath. Melian then left, and with\nher, the protective Girdle thus ended the bliss of old that reigned in\nDoriath for thousands of years, and things would never be the same\nagain.\n\nThingol, in possession of the greatest work of the Elves (a Silmaril of\nFëanor) and Dwarves (the Nauglamir) decides to merge the two. He\nconvinces a large company of smiths from Nogrod to attempt to remake the\nNauglamir to incorporate the Silmaril, which they succeed in doing. Once\nthe work is complete, and the joint works of Elves and Dwarves sits\nglittering before Thingol, he moves to take it and put it on. The\nDwarves stop him, demanding it in payment. Thingol rebukes them with\nhaughty words, at which the Dwarves slay him. The Dwarves attempt to\nescape Doriath, but most are killed and the Nauglamir recovered. After\nThingol's death, Melian departs Doriath in grief and withdraws her power\nfrom Doriath. After telling Mablung to send word to Beren, she vanishes\nfrom Middle-earth and returns to Valinor. Doriath now lies\nundefended.\n\nTwo Dwarves return from Doriath and tell a twisted version of the events\nto their king in Nogrod. The Dwarves of Nogrod raise an army and assault\nDoriath in retaliation. The slaughter is great on both sides, but the\nDwarves end up victorious. Menegroth is ransacked, many of its people\nare killed, and the Dwarves begin the long trek for home laden with the\nspoils of war, including the Nauglamir. At Sarn Athrad, they are\nassaulted by a force of Green Elves led by Beren who, with the aid of\nthe Ents of Ossiriand, annihilate the Dwarven force and recover the\nSilmaril.\n\nDior Eluchîl, son of Beren and Lúthien and heir to Thingol, returns to\nDoriath with his wife Nimloth, their two sons Eluréd and Elurín, and\ntheir daughter Elwing. He begins to rebuild the fortunes of the kingdom\nand it is briefly restored. Beren takes the Nauglamir to Lúthien, who\nwears it, enriching their home on Tol Galen. However, Beren and Lúthien\nsoon die for the second time, leaving the world forever. The Nauglamir\nand its Silmaril are brought to Dior.\n\nSoon after, the Sons of Fëanor, following the Oath, demand the return of\nthe Silmaril. Dior refuses, and the Sons of Fëanor invade Doriath, at\nwhich point the Second Kinslaying occurs. Celegorm, Curufin, and\nCaranthir are killed, as is Dior, Nimloth, and Eluréd and Elurín. The\npeople of Doriath are killed or scattered, with Elwing taking the\nNauglamir and fleeing with a remnant of the people of Doriath to the\nMouths of Sirion.\n\nDoriath was never rebuilt and afterwards Doriath remained abandoned and\nunpopulated until it was sunk along with most of the rest of\nBeleriand.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Sindarin, _Doriath_ means “Land of the Fence”, from _dôr_ (“land”)\nand _iâth_ (“fence”). Its previous name _EGLADOR_ either means “Land of\nthe Forsaken” or “Land of the Elves”, because the inhabitants called\nthemselves “Eglath”. The High Elves called Doriath the “Land of the\nCave”, from the Ñoldorin _gath_ or _gatta_ (“cavern”)\n\n_GARTHÚRIAN_ was name ascribed to the land of Doriath in earlier\nversions of the accounts of the First Age (specifically in _The War of\nthe Jewels_)_._",

    "text": "QUENTA SILMARILLION is a collection of fictional legends written by J.\nR. R. Tolkien. It was published after his death as part of _The\nSilmarillion_ together with four shorter stories. As Tolkien did not\nfinish it, the collection was completed by his son Christopher with\nassistance of the young Guy Gavriel Kay. The title _Quenta Silmarillion_\nis translated as “the Tale of the Silmarils”. The QUENTA SILMARILLION is\nthe third part of the _The Silmarillion._\n\n_Quenta Silmarillion_ is the largest final-rendition account of the\nFirst Age, and its stories narrate all of that Age's major events.\n\n\nContents\n\n-   Of the Beginning of Days\n-   Of Aulë and Yavanna\n-   Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\n-   Of Thingol and Melian\n-   Of Eldamar and the Princes of the Eldalië\n-   Of Fëanor and the Unchaining of Melkor\n-   Of the Silmarils and the Unrest of the Noldor\n-   Of the Darkening of Valinor\n-   Of the Flight of the Noldor\n-   Of the Sindar\n-   Of the Sun and Moon and the Hiding of Valinor\n-   Of Men\n-   Of the Return of the Noldor\n-   Of Beleriand and its Realms\n-   Of the Noldor in Beleriand\n-   Of Maeglin\n-   Of the Coming of Men into the West\n-   Of the Ruin of Beleriand and the Fall of Fingolfin\n-   Of Beren and Lúthien\n-   Of the Fifth Battle: Nirnaeth Arnoediad\n-   Of Túrin Turambar\n-   Of the Ruin of Doriath\n-   Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin\n-   Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nTolkien envisaged _The Silmarillion_ as deriving from a manuscript\nwritten by an Eriol or Ælfwine of England; an imaginary Dark Age source\nfor the material, which itself contains little or no reference to the\npeople or events of the Second or Third Ages of his legendarium.\nOriginated from Elvish legends, in some parts it presents Elves as long\ngone, which hints that its final form was edited during the Fourth Age\nby Hobbits and/or Men.\n\nIt tells about the history of Arda (the Earth), after its creation by\nEru Ilúvatar. The Valar, angelic beings, enter into the world and try to\nshape it after a vision given to them by Eru. The initial shape of Arda,\nchosen by the Valar, was of a symmetrical continent lit by the Two\nLamps. However, the lamps were destroyed by the vicious Melkor; Arda was\ndarkened, and the lamps' fall spoiled the symmetry of Arda's surface.\nTwo main continents were created that are of concern to the story: Aman\nin the west, and Middle-earth in the east.\n\nFollowing this, Melkor hid himself from the Valar in his fortress Utumno\nin the north of Middle-earth. He also surrounded himself with horrible\nbeasts, many of them Maia in the form of fell animals, known as Balrogs.\n\nThe Valar moved to the western continent Aman where they established the\nrealm Valinor of which Manwë was made king. The Vala Yavanna created the\nTwo Trees which illuminated Valinor. Middle-earth, by contrast, was in\nperpetual darkness, and was seldom visited by the Valar. Only some of\nthem, most notably Oromë, visited it periodically, especially to prepare\nfor the coming of the Elves, which the Valar had foreseen in their\nvision and to keep an eye on Melkor's activities.\n\nIntroduction of the Elves\n\nOn one of his expeditions Oromë discovered the newly-awakened Elves at\nCuiviénen. The Valar, aware of the risk Melkor posed to the Elves,\nbeleaguered his fortress and finally overthrew him and took him prisoner\nto Valinor to serve “three ages” in the Halls of Mandos.\n\nOromë was then sent to the Elves again, to invite them to come with him\nto Aman and live there. Some of the Elves did not follow him or became\nsidetracked and stayed in Middle-earth, and so the Elves became\nsundered. These notably included the Sindar, who stayed in Middle-earth\nwhen their king, Thingol, became lost in the forest. He was to later\nemerge, married to the Maia Melian, and found the Kingdom of Doriath.\n\nThe Elves who accepted the summons were carried across the sea on a\nfloating island.\n\nThe Noldor and Melkor\n\nFinwë, the first High King of the Ñoldor, had a son Fëanor. At his birth\nFëanor drew so much life from his mother Míriel that she grew weary of\nlife and her spirit left her bodily form, departing to the halls of\nMandos. Eventually, Finwë married Indis and had two further sons,\nFingolfin and Finarfin. Fëanor became the most famous Elven craftsman,\nespecially by making the Silmarils, three jewels in which he trapped the\nlight of the Two Trees. The Silmarils were hallowed by Varda, and would\nburn any evil or mortal creature who touched them.\n\nAbout this time, Melkor, having completed his sentence, convinced the\nother Valar that he had reformed and he was released. By various lies he\nmanaged to play Fëanor and Fingolfin against each other, creating strife\nand division amongst the Noldor; furthermore, he convinced the Ñoldor\nthat they had been brought to Aman primarily so the Valar could keep\nthem under control. Finally, Fëanor rebelled against the Valar, publicly\nadvocating leaving and then drawing his weapon against Fingolfin.\n\nThe Valar were soon aware of Melkor's ultimate responsibility in this.\nTulkas hunted him, but Melkor had hidden and could not be found. Because\nhe threatened Fingolfin's life, Fëanor was exiled from Tirion for twelve\nyears. With his seven sons and his father Finwë he moved to a\nnewly-built stronghold, Formenos.\n\nCoveting the Silmarils, Melkor went to Formenos, hoping to trick Fëanor\nand gain possession of them, but Fëanor saw through his ruse and\ndismissed him with contempt. Melkor then traveled to Avathar in secret,\nwhere he joined forces with the evil spirit Ungoliant, whose form was a\ngiant spider-like creature. Melkor swore an oath to give Ungoliant\nwhatever she desired, and imparted some of his power to her. With her\nhelp, they traveled into Valinor secretly, where Ungoliant's poison\nkilled the Two Trees. Covered by an impenetrable blackness, Melkor and\nUngoliant then traveled to Formenos, assassinated Finwë and stole the\nSilmarils, before escaping in the confusion.\n\nMelkor and Ungoliant then made their way across to Middle-earth, and he\ngave Ungoliant all the great jewels he had stolen, except the Silmarils,\nwhich he desired to keep. The rapacious Ungoliant consumed them all and,\nstill hungry, she demanded the Silmarils, but the ever-treacherous\nMelkor reneged on his oath, so she seized him and bound him with her\nwebs, and his anguished cries echoed across all of Middle-earth.\n\nMelkor escaped from Ungoliant with the help of his former servants, the\nBalrogs, who came to his aid from their hiding places in the deepest\nrecesses of the ruins of Utumno, and he re-established his empire in the\nNorth from his secondary fortress of Angband. He placed the three\nSilmarils, which now were the only source of the unmarred light of the\nTwo Trees, in his Iron Crown, although his hands were burned black by\nthem.\n\nFëanor was furious at the death of his father and the theft of the\nSilmarils. Travelling to Tirion in violation of his exile, he publicly\nblamed both Melkor, whom he named Morgoth, and the Valar (for failing to\nprotect Finwë and the Silmarils). He urged the Noldor to leave Valinor,\nfor a punitive expedition against Morgoth and a new life in\nMiddle-earth. He and his sons then swore the notorious Oath of Fëanor,\nvowing to pursue with hatred anyone who withheld a Silmaril from them.\n\nDeparture of the Noldor and assault on Doriath\n\nInflamed by the passionate urging of Fëanor, most of the assembled\nÑoldor left Tirion, and traveled to Alqualondë, attempting to persuade\nthe Teleri to join them, or at least to lend them ships to cross the\nGreat Sea. When the Teleri refused, Fëanor ordered that the swan-ships\nbe taken by force; the notorious Kinslaying ensued, in which many Teleri\nwere slaughtered. Shortly afterwards, at the northern boundary of\nEldamar, the Noldor encountered Mandos, who cursed all the Ñoldor who\nleft with Fëanor .\n\nAt this point, Finarfin, who had always been reluctant to leave, turned\nback to Valinor with a small number of followers. Many ships had been\nlost by this time and not all the Ñoldor could cross to Middle-earth, so\nFëanor and his sons seized the remaining swan-ships, abandoning\nFingolfin and his followers (including Galadriel), who were obliged to\nmake their way to Middle-earth across the terrible ice wastes of the\nHelcaraxë. Approximately 2.2 million Noldor are said to have perished on\nthe Helcaraxë.\n\nMeanwhile, Morgoth attempted to conquer Doriath, the realm of Thingol\nand Melian in Middle-earth. In the first of five great Battles, he sent\nout two armies of Orcs, forcing Thingol and his Maia queen to establish\na magical boundary around Doriath, the “Girdle of Melian”, while the\ncoastal Elves were forced to retreat into their fortified harbour towns.\nBy luck, Fëanor and his host arrived at the height of this conflict and\nthe combined forces of the Ñoldor and the Sindar utterly defeated the\nOrc armies in the second Battle, Dagor-nuin-Giliath (Battle under the\nStars). However Fëanor, in his fury, chased after the retreating Orcs\nand he was ambushed and killed by Balrogs.\n\nThe Sun and the Moon, the Long Peace and the Coming of Men\n\nThe grieving Valar could not revive the Two Trees,because Fëanor would\nnot give up the silmarills which captured the light of the trees. But\nthey were able to create the Moon and the Sun from a silver leaf and a\ngolden fruit, which were all that remained of them. These new lights\nilluminated Middle-earth, stimulated much new plant and animal growth,\nand for a while, confounded the plans of Morgoth. Unable to assail them,\nas his once near-limitless power grew ever more dispersed among his\nservants, who feared the new lights no less than he, the Dark Lord was\nforced to take refuge in clouds and shadow that surrounded his\nstrongholds. In this era, Men, the younger Children of Ilúvatar, awoke\nin eastern Middle-earth, and some began to migrate westward.\n\nThe Ñoldor established kingdoms and principalities in northern and\ncentral Beleriand, which were ruled by the descendants of Fëanor,\nFingolfin and Finarfin. They built many great strongholds, including the\nvast cavern-city of Nargothrond, on the river Narog, and the mighty\nhidden mountain fortress of Gondolin, ruled by Turgon, from whence none\nwho entered were permitted to leave. Many of the Sindar, the native\nElves of Beleriand, were absorbed into the Ñoldorin kingdoms. Others\nwere in Sindarin states: Thingol's kingdom in Doriath, the coastal Falas\nruled by Círdan the shipwright, and the secretive Green-Elves of\nOssiriand.\n\nRelations between the Ñoldor and the independent Sindar were at first\namicable but they later deteriorated. The Ñoldor had long hidden the\ntruth about the Kinslaying and the Curse from Thingol, but he eventually\nlearned of it from Angrod. As a result he banned all the Ñoldor (except\nhis kin in the house of Finarfin) from entering Doriath, decreeing also\nthat the Noldorin tongue could no longer be spoken within his realm.\n\nA further rift between the Ñoldor and the Sindar, which was to have\nfar-reaching consequences, was caused by the actions of Aredhel,\ndaughter of Fingolfin and sister of Turgon. Tiring of her long\nconfinement in Gondolin, she rode east to seek out her old friends, the\nsons of Fëanor, but she was barred from crossing through Doriath by the\ndecree of Thingol. Forced to skirt along the edge of the dreaded region\nof Nan Dungortheb (where Ungoliant had gone after the escape of\nMorgoth), Aredhel was separated from her escort and lost. She was\neventually found by Eöl, the Dark Elf, a kinsman of Thingol who lived\nalone in the dark forest of Nan Elmoth. He took her as his wife, and\nthey had a son, Maeglin. Eöl often traveled east to deal with the\nDwarves of the Blue Mountains, and he acquired great skill in metalwork\nfrom them, which he imparted to his son. He refused to let his wife and\nchild leave his domain, but Aredhel determined to return to Gondolin\nwith her son, so they waited until Eöl left for the east and then made\ntheir escape.\n\nEöl pursued them to Gondolin, where he was captured and brought before\nTurgon. Eöl demanded that Maeglin should leave with him, or be cursed,\nbut Maeglin renounced his father. Turgon then decreed that Eöl must\neither remain in Gondolin or die. The next day, when he was again\nbrought before Turgon, Eöl tried to kill Maeglin with a poisoned lance,\nbut Aredhel stepped between them; struck in the shoulder, she died that\nnight. As punishment, Turgon had Eöl thrown to his death from the walls\nof the fortress. Maeglin remained in Gondolin, became a mighty warrior\nand wrought many great weapons, but his forbidden love for his cousin\nIdril Celebrindal would eventually cause him to betray Gondolin to\nMorgoth.\n\nAfter fifty years, and believing the Noldor to be unprepared for war,\nMorgoth again attacked the from the north, but Fingolfin and Maedhros\nwere ready for him and they defeated Morgoth's forces in the third\nBattle, called Dagor Aglareb, pursuing the Orcs to the very gates of\nAngband and destroying them utterly. They then laid the Siege of\nAngband, which lasted for four hundred years.\n\nAlmost one hundred years after the Dagor Aglareb, Morgoth's forces tried\nto attack the realm of Hithlum by stealing in from the far north-west,\nbut were intercepted and defeated by Fingon. After a further hundred\nyears, Morgoth sent forth the dragon Glaurung, the first of the\nFire-drakes. Being only half-grown and not fully armoured, Glaurung was\nunable to withstand Fingon and his archers, eventually fleeing back to\nAngband. The period after the first defeat of Glaurung became known as\nThe Long Peace, lasting almost two hundred years.\n\nIt was during this time, about three hundred years after the Noldor had\narrived in Beleriand, that Men first came into Middle-earth from the\nregions far to the east. They first appeared in Ossiriand, where\nFelagund was the first of the Noldor to see them. Over the next hundred\nyears many of them became allies of the Noldor in the war against\nMorgoth, and settled in Noldorin realms.\n\nThe Dagor Bragollach\n\nMorgoth, however, merely used the Siege as an opportunity to build up\nstrength, and in , renewed the war on his own terms. The fourth Great\nBattle, Dagor Bragollach became famous for the re-emergence of the\nDragon Glaurung in his full strength. Morgoth's armies overthrew the\nSiege, slaying many of the Noldor, with Glaurung laying waste to\nArd-galen and Dorthonion.\n\nEnraged by the assaults against his people, Fingolfin fearlessly made\nhis way alone to the gates of Angband, where he challenged Morgoth to\nsingle combat and the evil Vala was forced to come out and meet him\nrather than appear cowardly. In the ensuing battle Fingolfin wounded\nMorgoth seven times, but eventually stumbled and fell among the great\npits created by Morgoth's hammer, Grond. Morgoth beat Fingolfin to the\nground three times with his great shield, and then crushed Fingolfin\nunder his foot, but with his dying strength Fingolfin slashed Morgoth's\nfoot, maiming him.\n\nMorgoth broke Fingolfin's body and was about to throw the remains to his\nwolves, but Thorondor, the gigantic king of the eagles, had been\nwatching the battle from afar and at that moment flew down to rescue the\nbody. The giant eagle gouged Morgoth's face with his talons, seized\nFingolfin's body and carried it back to Gondolin for burial. After that\ntime Morgoth's seven wounds never healed, he became lame in his left\nfoot, where Fingolfin had hewn it, and his face forever bore the scars\nof Thorondor's talons.\n\nSixteen years later, Maedhros led the northern Ñoldor and their allies\namong Men in a final desperate attempt to defeat Morgoth. In this\nclimactic battle — which is named Nirnaeth Arnoediad— the forces of the\nÑoldor attacked Angband and briefly broke through the gates, only to be\nbeaten back when Morgoth unleashed his full forces, now vastly\noutnumbering those of Elves and Men. Led by the terrible dragon\nGlaurung, Morgoth's forces crushed the armies of the Ñoldor, and many of\nthe elf lords were killed or captured, leaving Morgoth master of the\nentire North. Afterwards, he set about destroying the remaining\nElf-kingdoms one by one.\n\nThe Dagor Bragollach was the battle in which Gil-galad left Hithlum for\nthe Havens of the Falas.\n\nBeren and Lúthien\n\nThe later parts of the _Quenta Silmarillion_ include two stories dealing\nwith individuals and with the relations between Men and Elves.\n\nThe tragic yet heroic story of Beren and Lúthien (which has similarities\nto the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice) tells of the love between the Man\nBeren and Lúthien, daughter of Thingol and Melian and the most beautiful\nof all Elf Maidens. Thingol, disliking mortal Men and determined to\nprevent their marriage, declares that he will consent only if Beren\nbrings Thingol a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown. Thus, in sending Beren\non this perilous quest, Thingol unwittingly binds himself to the Doom of\nMandos, ensuring his eventual downfall.\n\nTravelling to the mountains of Thangorodrim in disguise, Beren and\nLúthien succeed in making their way into Angband and to the very foot of\nMorgoth's throne. There Lúthien reveals herself, but her beauty and\ncharm enable her to briefly overcome the evil lord and she casts a spell\nthat puts Morgoth and his minions to sleep. Beren then cuts one of the\nSilmarils from Morgoth's iron crown, but when he attempts to take a\nsecond Silmaril his knife snaps and a shard flies off; it cuts Morgoth's\nface, and he begins to stir.\n\nAs they leave, Morgoth and his creatures reawaken and Beren and Lúthien\nare confronted by Carcharoth, the giant Wolf that guards the gate of\nAngband. Beren attempts to hold off the terrible creature with the power\nof the Silmaril, but Carcharoth bites off his hand and swallows the holy\njewel. Driven mad by the pain it inflicts, the creature goes on a\nrampage through Doriath until it is eventually killed by the mighty\nElf-hound Huan. In this final battle Beren is fatally wounded by\nCarcharoth, so Lúthien travels in spirit to the Houses of the Dead, to\nplead with Mandos for Beren's release. She and Beren are sent back to\nMiddle-earth alive, but Lúthien becomes a mortal woman, so that in time\nthey will both die and leave the Universe together. As immortals whose\nsouls are bound to Arda for as long as it lasts, Thingol and Melian\nsuffer the grief of being deprived of their daughter for all time.\n\nTúrin Turambar\n\n_Main article: Túrin Turambar_\n\n_See also: The Children of Húrin_\n\nAlso included is the story of Túrin Turambar. His father Húrin is\ncaptured at the end of the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, and for his\ndefiance, Morgoth places a curse on his family. Túrin becomes a great\nhero, but due partly to his hot temper and partly to a string of bad\nluck (in fact, the working of Morgoth's demonic will), whatever he turns\nhis hand to seems to go wrong, and death and grief haunt those around\nhim. Making matters worse, both Túrin and his sister Niënor are\nenchanted by the mighty dragon Glaurung — who has sacked the great\nElf-city of Nargothrond and taken up residence there — and they fall in\nlove and live for time as man and wife. Eventually Túrin kills Glaurung,\nbut with his death the spell is lifted. Driven mad by the realisation of\ntheir sins, Túrin and Nienor both commit suicide.\n\nGondolin\n\nThe last Elf-Kingdom to fall was the hidden city of Gondolin. Tuor, a\nmortal man, was sent by Ulmo as a messenger to Gondolin, to warn King\nTurgon of the city's impending destruction. Remaining in Gondolin, Tuor\nmarried Turgon's daughter, Idril, and they had a son Eärendil. Gondolin\nwas eventually betrayed to Morgoth by Maeglin, and destroyed. Turgon\nfell during the battle and the High Kingship passed to Gil-galad, who\ndwelt at the Mouth of Sirion. Tuor, Idril and Eärendil escaped, together\nwith a number of refugees.\n\nGrowing up, Eärendil married Elwing, granddaughter of Beren and Lúthien\nand current keeper of the Silmaril they took from Morgoth. With the help\nof the Silmaril, Eärendil and Elwing sailed to Valinor to plead with the\nValar, asking them to pardon the Noldor and assist Elves and Men in\ntheir need. The Valar agreed to this request, and set Eärendil, with the\nSilmaril, to sail the skies as a star until the ending of the world.\n\nBattle between Morgoth and the Host of the Valar\n\nThe Host of the Valar, led by Eönwë, finally attacked Morgoth in\nAngband. In this battle, the Great Battle (also known as the War of\nWrath), Morgoth was utterly defeated; his armies were destroyed, with\nonly a few remnants scattered across the Earth. He was taken prisoner\nand his two remaining Silmarils were confiscated. Maedhros and Maglor,\nFëanor's two surviving sons, stole the Silmarils from Eönwë, but they\nfound the Silmarils would not tolerate their touch, instead tormenting\nthem with burning pain. Maedhros committed suicide by jumping with the\nSilmaril into a chasm in the earth, and Maglor threw his Silmaril away\ninto the sea.\n\nThe Valar pardoned the Ñoldor for their rebellion, and the Teleri\noffered forgiveness for the Kinslaying. Many of the Ñoldor and the\nSindar left Middle-earth and traveled into the West, to live in Valinor.\nMany more followed Gil-galad and stayed in Middle-earth. Morgoth was\ncast out of the World, imprisoned in the Void that lies behind the Walls\nof Night. The Silmarils were lost “unless the World be broken and\nre-made”, but each one found its home in one of the elements: sky,\nwater, and earth."

    "page_id": "2360",
    "text": "The AKALLABÊTH is the fourth part of _The Silmarillion_, and the primary\naccount of the downfall of Númenor_._ It is relatively short, consisting\nof about thirty pages.\n\nThe story is written in the voice of Pengolodh, and is one of the more\nsignificant stories associated with Ælfwine.\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nAkallabêth (_The Downfallen_ in Adûnaic; Quenya is ''Atalantë;\n''Mar-nu-Falmar as another Quenya name.) is the story of the destruction\nof the Kingdom of Númenor, as written by Elendil. At the end of the\nFirst Age (described in detail in the _Quenta Silmarillion_), those of\nMen who had been helping Elves in their fight against Melkor were given\na new small continent of their own, free from the evil and sadness of\nMiddle-earth. It was located in the middle of the Great Ocean, between\nthe western shores of Middle-earth, and the eastern shores of Aman,\nwhere the Valar dwelt.\n\nAs they entered Númenor, the race of Men was forbidden to set sail\ntowards Aman, they gladly agreed to this because they regarded mortality\nas a gift and did not envy the Valar and Elves who could not die. For\ntwo and a half thousand years Númenor grew in might; Númenórian ships\nsailed the seas and established remote colonies, some of them in\nMiddle-earth. During that time the Elves of Middle-earth were engaged in\na bitter fight with Morgoth's former servant Sauron, who had turned into\na Dark Lord himself. The Elves asked for the help of the Númenórians and\nthey agreed but as time went on, over the course of one and half\nthousand years, Men desired immortality and rebelled against the Valar\nand the Elves. Their second last king, Tar Palantir, tried to amend the\nevil but it was too late. During this time, Númenor grew even more\npowerful.\n\nThe last king, Ar-Pharazôn, wanted control of Middle-earth, and so he\nattacked Sauron. Sauron's armies became afraid of the might of Númenor,\nand so he was captured and brought imprisoned to the Númenórian king.\nHowever, Sauron exploited his power to corrupt the Númenorian king to\nhis will. Soon he became his adviser, and much of Númenor obeyed his\nwill and worshipped Morgoth. Sauron convinced Ar-Pharazôn to try to\nassail Aman for immortality, desiring to destroy Númenor with the wrath\nof the Valar. However as this was done, the Valar appealed to Eru\nIlúvatar. Eru destroyed the Númenórian host, by crushing it under\nstones; however, he also caused the whole of Númenor to sink under the\nGreat Ocean. Just a few men of Númenórian royal blood, descendants of a\nlong line called “The Faithful” because they were uncorrupted by Sauron,\nhad fled Númenor by ships earlier with some gifts that Men received from\nthe Valar and the Elves in times of peace. They were led by Elendil the\nTall, and his two sons: Isildur and Anárion.\n\nThey set sail to Middle-earth, where the followers of Elendil\nestablished two kingdoms, which were managed as Númenórian provinces:\nGondor in the south and Arnor in the North. Some of the King's Men,\nenemies of Elendil, established other realms in exile to the south; of\nthese Umbar was the chief. The culture of Númenor became the dominant\nculture of Middle-earth (thus, Westron, a descendant of the Adûnaic\nlanguage of Númenor became the lingua franca). The sadness and the shock\nfrom the loss of a whole continent lived ever after in the hearts of\nkings of Númenórian descent. Arda was made spherical, and Aman was put\nfurther beyond Middle-earth, out of the reach of mortal men. Sauron,\nalthough greatly diminished and bereft of shape, escaped Númenor and\nreturned to Middle-earth once more.\n\n\nTextual history\n\nThe story originated with _The Lost Road_, an abandoned time-travel\nnovel. It was later adapted into back-story for _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nAs the Quenya name makes obvious, this is a retelling of the story of\nthe lost city of Atlantis, in the Middle-earth cadre. “Atalantë” is\nQuenya for “Downfallen”.\n\n\nCanon\n\nChristopher Tolkien notes in _The Peoples of Middle-earth_ that in the\nfinal version of Akallabêth, written by his father, the work is written\nin the voice of Pengolodh, and that the story was originally addressed\nto Ælfwine by him.\n\n    The authentic text began: “Of Men, Ælfwine, it is said by the Eldar\n    that they came into the world in the time of the Shadow of Morgoth\n    ...”\n\nChristopher then admits that this removal made the whole source lose its\nanchorage in Eldarin lore, and he believed he used poor judgment and\nexcessive vigilance, which also led him to alterations of the end of the\nparagraph (perhaps editorial work that was not his to properly make, as\nhe went against his father's original intent). Christopher also points\nout that the last paragraph of Akallabêth, as published in _The\nSilmarillion_, still contains indirect references to Ælfwine, the\n'Straight Road' and other 'future mariners', which he never altered or\nremoved."

    "text": "OSSIRIAND (Sindarin IPA: ) was a region of the eastern Beleriand. It was\nalso known as the LAND OF SEVEN RIVERS.\n\n\nDescription\n\nOssiriand was the most eastern region of Beleriand during the First Age,\nlying between the Blue Mountains and the river Gelion. Along the\nnorthern shore of the Ascar ran the Dwarf-Road to Nogrod. The region was\nwarm and gentle, with coniferous woodlands.\n\nSeven rivers lay in the region of Ossiriand, and these are (from north\nto south):\n\n1.  River _Gelion_\n2.  River _Ascar_ or _Rathlóriel_\n3.  River _Thalos_\n4.  River _Legolin_\n5.  River _Brilthor_\n6.  River _Duilwen_\n7.  River _Adurant_\n\n\nHistory\n\nOssiriand was a green and forested land, and it was not populated by the\nSindar. In the early First Age before the rise of the Moon, a part of\nthe Telerin elven people called Nandor entered Ossiriand under their\nleader King Denethor, and were given permission by Thingol to settle the\nlands.\n\nAfter them the land was often renamed Lindon, for _The Singers_, after\nthe old clan-name of the Telerin which the Nandor still used in their\ntongue. They became known as the Laiquendi, or Green-Elves.\n\nThe Elves of Ossiriand participated in the first battle of the Wars of\nBeleriand. After their leader Denethor was killed in an orc-raid they\nchose no more leaders, and many of them moved to Doriath.\n\nAfter the Quest for the Silmaril, Beren and Lúthien lived their second\nlives in Dor Firn-i-Guinar on Tol Galen. In FA 470, their son Dior was\nborn here. After the death of Thingol, Beren laid an attack against\nthe Dwarves of Nogrod, leading an army of Nandorin Elves and Ents.\n\nOssiriand was the only part of Beleriand that survived the War of Wrath,\nbut Belegaer the Great Sea broke through the mountain chain at the\nformer riverbed of Ascar, creating the Gulf of Lhûn. In the Second\nAge and Third Age, the former lands of Ossiriand and Thargelion were\nknown as LINDON, where Gil-galad the High King ruled.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name OSSIRIAND means “Land of the Seven Rivers”, from the Quenya\n_otso_ (“seven”), Sindarin _sîr_ (“river”), and '' -ian(d)'',\nwhich is commonly used in the names of regions or countries.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nWhile conceiving a name, J.R.R. Tolkien had numerous choices for this\nland. He originally wrote Broseliand (which eventually led to\nBeleriand). The other names were Colodhinand, Ñoldorinan, Geleriand,\nBladorinand, Belaurien, Arsiriand, Lassiriand, Ossiriand.",

    "page_id": "2404",
    "text": "THANGORODRIM was a group of three gigantic active volcanoes within the\nIron Mountains in the north of Middle-earth during the First Age. They\nwere raised by Morgoth, who delved his fortress of Angband beneath them\nand far back into the Iron Mountains. They were the highest peaks in all\nof Middle Earth.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThangorodrim was made up of three volcanoes of which were said to have\nbeen crafted by Morgoth from the slag and debris of the re-delving of\nAngband during the First Age. The mountains themselves were of little\nconsequence during Morgoth's rule of Angband, save to occasionally spew\nforth fire and magma when Morgoth was either exceptionally wrathful or\non the warpath.\n\nAfter the death of his father, Maedhros was taken prisoner and nailed to\na cliff of Thangorodrim as a method of torture. He was rescued by his\ncousin Fingon with the help of Thorondor, King of the Eagles. After\nhis family was cursed by Morgoth, Húrin was imprisoned in a chair on a\nhigh terrace to watch the curse unfold.\n\nFor a time immediately after the creation of Thangorodrim, the Great\nEagles made their eyries on the three mountains at the command of\nManwë in order to bring him news of Morgoth's doings. However, at some\ntime during the First Age the Eagles moved to the Crissaegrim near\nGondolin.\n\nAt the base of the south face of the middle peak was the Great Gate of\nAngband, a deep canyon leading into the mountain, lined with towers and\nforts. There were also a number of secret gates scattered around the\nsides of the mountain group, from which Morgoth's hosts could issue\nforth and surprise their foes.\n\nThangorodrim was destroyed during the War of Wrath at the end of the\nFirst Age when Ancalagon, freshly slain by Eärendil fell dead on the\npeaks and crushed them to rubble.\n\n\nSize and Height\n\nThe exact size and height of Thangorodrim are unclear, though they were\nsaid to have been the tallest mountains in Middle-earth. One drawing by\nTolkien illustrated in Karen Wynn Fonstad's _The Atlas of Middle-earth_,\nif drawn to scale, would have made each mountain 35,000 ft high and five\nmiles across, and the statement that it lay 150 leagues (450 Númenórean\nmiles) north of Menegroth puts it too far away for some of the action in\n_The Silmarillion_ to make sense; a distance of 150-200 miles would have\nbeen more consistent. It is possible that with the higher figure Tolkien\nwas not referring to 'as the eagle flies', but rather 'as the wolf\nruns': the plateau of Dorthonion forced a long detour, which added the\nextra 200, 250 miles to the distance.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_THANGORODRIM_ was a Sindarin word that tied together the roots\n'oppression', 'mountain', and 'group'; together meaning roughly\n'Oppressive peaks'."

    "text": "The TWO LAMPS, also known as THE LAMPS OF THE VALAR, refer to ILLUIN\n(Sky-blue), the lamp which formerly stood at the northern end of Arda\nand ORMAL (High-gold) which stood at the southern end of Arda.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nAfter the Valar entered the world and brought order to the seas and the\nlands and the mountains, and subdued the fires of Melkor, there was a\nneed for light. Aulë at the prayer of Yavanna forged two mighty lamps,\nIlluin and Ormal. Varda filled the lamps with light and Manwë hallowed\nthem, and the Valar set them up on high pillars, Illuin in the furthest\nnorth upon the pillar of Helcar, Ormal in the deepest south upon the\npillar of Ringol. In the middle of Arda, where the light of the lamps\nmingled, amid the Great Lake lay the Isle of Almaren, where the Valar\ndwelt.\n\nDestruction\n\nThe pillars were cast down and their lamps broken by Melkor. Lands were\nbroken, seas arose in tumult, and destroying flame from the broken lamps\npoured out over the Earth, marring it, causing the Valar to flee\nMiddle-earth for the Land of Aman, where they established the domain of\nValinor. Where Illuin fell, the Sea of Helcar was formed, of which\nCuiviénen was a bay.\n\n\nOther Versions of the Legendarium\n\nIn Tolkien's older writings (not used in the published version of _The\nSilmarillion_), the Valar sought peace with Melkor, asking his\nassistance with fixing the lamps upon Arda. Melkor, still envious and\nhateful of the rest of the Valar, agreed to give them a strong, sturdy\nsubstance. He gave Aulë ice. Melkor permitted the Valar to do as they\nwished until the fateful day when the Lamps' light and heat finally\nmelted the ice. The pillars crashed upon Arda, flooding it with water\nand darkness."

It was at this place where the light of the\nTwo Lamps mingled. Almaren was attacked and damaged by Melkor, and the\nValar moved far to the West, to Valinor."

    "page_id": "2433",
    "text": "The NÍRNAETH ARNOEDIAD (“BATTLE OF UNNUMBERED TEARS”) was the fifth\ngreat battle against Morgoth that took place in the First Age.\n\n\nHistory\n\nAlmost twenty years after the defeat of the Elves and their Edain allies\nin the Dagor Bragollach, the Noldor had lost control over the entire\nnorth of Beleriand, and were for the most part reduced to holding on\ndefensively in Hithlum, Himring and Nargothrond. Gondolin was still\nhidden and could not yet be assailed. However, the deeds of Beren and\nLúthien, defeating Sauron at Tol-in-Gaurhoth and retrieving a Silmaril\nfrom Angband, convinced Maedhros that Morgoth was not invincible. In the\nyear 468 of the Years of the Sun in the First Age, Maedhros began\nbuilding an alliance that he believed capable of taking the war to\nThangorodrim, known as the Union of Maedhros.\n\nUnder the command of Maedhros, all the Elves of Beleriand, as well as\nthe Edain, Dwarves, and the newly arrived Easterlings were invited to\ncombine in arms and fight against Morgoth. Unfortunately, the Oath of\nFëanor and the evil deeds done by the Sons of Fëanor to fulfill it\ncaused the Union to have less strength than it could have had. For\nOrodreth, the Lord of Nargothrond, remembering the deeds of Celegorm and\nCurufin that indirectly resulted in the death of Lord Finrod Felagund,\nsent no aid to the alliance. Against Orodreth's will however, a small\ncompany under the command of Gwindor went from Nargothrond. Their hope\nwas to avenge the capture of Gwindor's brother Gelmir during the Dagor\nBragollach. Worse yet, from Doriath there came only Mablung and Beleg,\nwho wished to take part in the great deeds they knew were to come. For\nThingol, King of Doriath, had in his possession the Silmaril recovered\nby Beren and Lúthien, and the Sons of Fëanor sent to him a haughty\ndemand for its surrender. Thingol however, was both insulted by the\ndemand and had begun to lust for the Silmaril. Thus, against the counsel\nof Melian, he refused to surrender it. As a result, Celegorm and Curufin\nvowed openly to destroy Doriath should they emerge victorious from the\nbattle against Morgoth. Therefore Thingol enhanced the guard at his\nborders and sent no troops to aid Maedhros.\n\nThe Union divided its strength into two separate forces to attack\nAngband. Under Maedhros in the east were gathered the remainder of the\nSons of Fëanor, the Elves and Men of Himring under Maedhros and Bór, the\nmen of Amon ereb under Caranthir and Ulfang, and the Dwarves of Nogrod\nand Belegost. Under Fingon in the west were gathered the Elves and Men\nof Hithlum, the Elves of the Falas, the Haladin of Brethil, the\ncompanies sent from Nargothrond and the two Elves of Doriath, Beleg and\nMablung. The plan was for Maedhros's host, the slightly greater of the\ntwo, to march openly across Anfauglith and draw out the main army of\nAngband, after which Fingon's host would attack from the Ered\nWethrin and crush the armies of Morgoth between the two forces. They\nwould then seal the doors of Angband and, hopefully, drive Morgoth\nunderground forever. The Union first cleared Beleriand and Dorthonion\nfrom the Orcs, and then gathered to assault Angband. However, these\nattacks alerted Morgoth to the existence of the Union, and he took\ncounsel against it.\n\nMorgoth learned of the battle plan of the Eldar from his spies, and\nsought to prevent Maedhros's forces from meeting with Fingon's. To that\nend, he sent a gigantic force of his own, one which included Glaurung\nand his numerous fire-breathing brood, to destroy Maedhros's host.\nFingon's troops eventually settled in the woods of Ered Wethrin to await\nthe coming of Maedhros's forces, not knowing that they had been\nattacked. Upon the arrival of Fingon's forces to Ered Wethrin, smoke and\nfire poured forth from Thangorodrim and the Iron Mountains. Fingon thus\nknew that Morgoth had become aware of his forces, and doubt began to\ngrow on him. Just at that moment however, Turgon arrived unexpectedly\nwith an army ten thousand strong from Gondolin, and hope was renewed in\nthe heart of the Elven host.\n\nAware of both the location of Fingon's troops and the strategy the elves\nhoped to employ, Morgoth sent a great force of Orcs from Angband to meet\nFingon's host. In actuality, this force was but a small portion of the\narmies Morgoth had prepared, and was ultimately little more than bait.\nFor Morgoth intended for this decoying force to draw out Fingon's army,\nand then to strengthen it when Fingon came from the hills to meet it.\nBut Fingon, wary of the guile of Morgoth, ignored the taunts of the Orcs\nand kept his forces hidden. Seeing this, the captain of the Orcish host\nsent out riders with tokens of parley. With them was Gelmir, Gwindor's\nbrother of Nargothrond, whom the Orcs had blinded. To provoke the Elvish\nhost, they dismembered Gelmir within sight of the Ered Wethrin and then\nkilled him, threatening to do the same with their other Elvish thralls.\nUnfortunately, Gwindor himself was in the forefront of the Elvish host,\nand he witnessed the cruel murder of his brother. Insane with grief and\nrage, he broke ranks and charged the heralds with the company from\nNargothrond and slew them, driving deep into the center of the Orcish\nhost. Seeing that his troops could not be restrained, Fingon sounded the\ncharge, and committed his entire force to the battle. Here, Morgoth's\ndesigns nearly went astray, for the onset of the Noldor charge was so\nswift and terrible that the Orcish host was destroyed before it could be\nstrengthened. At the forefront of the battle were Gwindor and his\ncompany, and their wrath was so great that they burst through Morgoth's\nouter gates and slew the guard in the very courts of Angband.\n\nIt was said that Morgoth trembled as Gwindor's company pounded upon his\ngates, but surrounded by a sea of enemies they became trapped in the\ncourt, and all were slain except Gwindor who was taken, for Fingon could\nnot come to their aid. Then, from many hidden doors in Thangorodrim,\nMorgoth let forth his main host. Fingon's army was driven back from the\nwalls of Angband with great loss. The Men of Brethil that comprised the\nrearguard were nearly all slain, along with Haldir, Lord of the Haladin.\nThe fourth day of the conflict was the official beginning of Nírnaeth\nArnoediad, and Fingon's forces continued to retreat with their\ncasualties mounting. At the start of the fifth day however, Fingon's\nforces were joined by Turgon, who had withheld most of his troops from\nthe foolhardy assault. The phalanx of Turgon broke through the lines of\nthe Enemy, and met with the guard of Fingon, along with Húrin son of\nGaldor. With Turgon's help, Fingon's forces managed to beat back the\nhost of Angband enough to begin an orderly retreat. \n\nHowever, the fortune of the Eldar then took another turn for the worse.\nFor while Fingon's armies had been fighting Morgoth's forces on the\nplains of Anfauglith, Maedhros had been defeated by the armies that\nMorgoth had sent against his host. To make matters worse, Maedhros had\nbeen betrayed by Ulfang, one of the sons of Uldor, who had summoned a\ngreat force of evil men from the surrounding hills to attack the elven\nhost. Reeling from the unexpected treachery and the continual assault of\nMorgoth's dragons, the eastern host would have been utterly destroyed if\nnot for the valor of the Dwarves of Belegost. For they were naturally\nable to withstand the dragons' fire better than Elves or Men, and\nmoreover they wore great iron masks that gave them additional\nprotection. These dwarves formed the rearguard of the eastern host, and\nallowed the remaining Elves and Men to escape the dragons. Azaghâl, King\nof the Dwarves of Belegost, gathered his forces and formed a ring around\nGlaurung to keep him at bay. Such was their strength and the keenness of\ntheir axes that even Glaurung's armored hide was not invulnerable to\ntheir blows. Enraged, Glaurung struck down Azaghâl and crawled over him,\nbut with his last strength Azaghâl ran a dagger through Glaurung's\nbelly, and the dragon fled in pain. With him fled all the beasts of\nMorgoth. In a solemn ceremony the Dwarves picked up their fallen leader,\nforgetting about the battle, and they marched his corpse home. Their\nwrath was so great that none troubled them. Their sacrifice allowed all\nseven of the Sons of Fëanor to escape, though their host was routed and\nscattered throughout Ossiriand.\n\n\n\nAfter defeating Maedhros, Morgoth's eastern host had made haste to to\njoin the battle against Fingon's forces, and arrived as the elven forces\nhad begun to withdraw. As they engaged the retreating Elves, Gothmog\nhimself arrived on the field with his Troll guard and engaged Fingon in\nsingle combat. The High Elven King managed to hold his own against the\nHigh Captain of Angband until another Balrog restrained Fingon from\nbehind. Gothmog then clove Fingon's head with his Black Axe, and the\nfield of battle was soon utterly lost. Seeing this, Húrin begged Turgon\nto return to Gondolin, and told the King that he and his men would cover\nthe Elven retreat. Huor, Húrin and the remaining Men of Dor-lómin then\nformed a living wall across the Fens of Serech, buying time for Turgon\nto escape with most of the surviving Elves of the north. The warriors of\nDor-lómin were all slain, and Huor fell with his eye pierced by a\npoisoned arrow. Finally Húrin was left to fight alone, wielding the\ngreat axe of an Orc captain two handed. He managed to slay seventy of\nhis foes, including a great number of Gothmog's troll guard, falling at\nlast after his axe withered away from the caustic troll blood upon it.\nGothmog then pulled Hurin out from under the mountain Orcs and Trolls\nthat he slew, bound him, and dragged him to Angband with mockery.\n\n\nAftermath\n\nAfter Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the ability of Elves and Men to make war\nagainst Morgoth was broken. Morgoth's victory was essentially complete,\nas he had destroyed all the people of Hithlum and had scattered the sons\nof Fëanor away from Himring. Morgoth's orcs razed all of Beleriand\nexcept for Doriath, which was still protected by the Girdle of Melian,\nand sacked the havens of the Falas. Nargothrond was also still free, but\nMorgoth gave little thought to either it or Doriath, knowing that the\ntwo remaining Elven kingdoms were no threat to him.\n\nMorgoth betrayed his servants the Easterlings and trapped them in\nHithlum under penalty of death, denying them the fertile lands of\nBeleriand. Still Morgoth knew fear, for Turgon, now High King of the\nÑoldor after the death of Fingon in the battle, had survived, and his\ncity of Gondolin was still unknown to Morgoth. Hoping to discover the\nwhereabouts of Turgon, Morgoth summoned Hurin to him, seeking from him\nthe location of Gondolin. But Hurin mocked Morgoth and refused to betray\nTurgon. Morgoth then laid a terrible curse upon him and his kin, and\nbound Hurin to a chair upon Thangoridrim to witness the curse\nunfold.\n\n\nAn alternate version\n\nA first and older version of the story was drawn by Christopher Tolkien\nprimarily from a text called the _Grey Annals_, although the Quenta\nSilmarillion was used as well. But in the writing of the long Narn i\nChîn Húrin, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote a new version of the battle which\npostdates both the GA and QS accounts. Christopher Tolkien did not\nincorporate the major changes of the new version into the Silmarillion\ntext, although he did take some phrasing and description from it.\n\nIn the earlier version of the battle, Morgoth sent no armies against the\nforces of Maedhros, and instead Uldor delayed Maedhros's host with a\ntreacherous warning of a false assault from Angband. Maedhors eventually\nrealized what he believed to be a mistake on Uldor's part, and his host\nat last arrived to aid Fingon in the fifth day as Turgon's forces did.\nMaedhros's forces assailed the armies of Angband in the rear, and\nMorgoth was forced to release his reserves, including his Balrogs,\nGlaurung and his brood, and Gothmog the Lord of Balrogs. It was said in\nthis version that the Elves might still have won, but Ulfang and his\nEasterlings betrayed Maedhros, and summoned a great strength of evil Men\nfrom the surrounding hills, routing the host of Maedhros.\n\nThe major difference was that Morgoth defeats the Elves much more\nhandily in the newer version than he did in the old one. The entire\nelement of the “Machinations of Uldor” delaying Maedhros's march is\nremoved, and Morgoth sends a second force to meet Maedhros and prevent\nhim from joining with the other elf lords. This version also lacks the\nnearly explicit statement that the Elves could have won had it not been\nfor the treachery of men.\n\nChristopher Tolkien did not venture a guess on why his father made these\nchanges, but it may be that he felt the Elves did much better against\nMorgoth than they reasonably should have (especially given the extreme\nlength and difficulty of the later War of Wrath). This is all\nspeculation, however. It was explicitly stated several times both by\nin-universe characters and Tolkien in the Silmarillion that the Elves\nhad absolutely no chance of defeating Morgoth unaided, so it is possible\nthat the changes were made to concur with this line of thinking.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_NÍRNAETH ARNOEDIAD_ was Sindarin for 'Tears Unnumbered'.",

During most of its course, it was the border between\nEast and West Beleriand.\n\n\nSource\n\nThe Sirion's source was at Eithel Sirion on the eastern side of the Ered\nWethrin, which lay in between Ard-galen (later Anfauglith) and Mithrim\nand Hithlum. It was guarded by the tower of Barad Eithel.\n\nSirion flowed southwards along the border of the Ered Wethrin, passing\nthrough the Fen of Serech before entering the narrow steep-sided valley\nbetween the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath named the PASS OF SIRION.\nSirion then continued south into Beleriand, with the Forest of Brethil\nto the west, and Dimbar and then Doriath to the east. After leaving\nDoriath at Aelin-uial (the Fens of Sirion), it plunged below ground in\nthe Falls of Sirion at Andram, where the ground fell steeply. Three\nleagues southwards, the Sirion exited the underground caves at the Gates\nof Sirion. It then flowed further south through NAN-TATHREN until it\nreached the Bay of Balar, part of Belegaer, at the Mouths of Sirion. It\ntotal length was about three hundred and ninety miles.\n\nIn order from north to south, the principal tributaries of the Sirion\nwere the Rivil, flowing from Dorthonion until it met Sirion in the Fen\nof Serech; the Mindeb, which had its source in Nan Dungortheb and the\nEred Gorgoroth, the Teiglin, the Esgalduin of Doriath; the Aros flowing\nsouth from Dorthonion (and also containing the waters of the Celon from\nHimring and Himlad) which met at Aelin-uial, and the Narog, which joined\nSirion in Nan-Tathren.\n\nThe main crossing points mentioned in the Silmarillion were Brithiach\nwhere the road from Himlad, which crossed the Esgalduin at Iant Iaur,\ncrossed Sirion, and the Ferries of Doriath. The most important island in\nSirion was Tol Sirion. The original Minas Tirith was built here by\nFinrod Felagund in the strategic location controlling the Pass of Sirion\nwhere it entered Beleriand between the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath.\nShortly after Dagor Bragollach, Sauron captured it and the island became\nknown as Tol-in-Gaurhoth.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBarad Eithel, at the source of the Sirion in the Ered Wethrin, was a\nchief fortress of Fingolfin and his son Fingon, probably guarding a pass\ninto their realm of Mithrim. Further south, in the Pass of Sirion, lay\nTol Sirion. After the Coming of Men, the Edain of the House of Haleth\nmade their home in the Forest of Brethil, and the Sindar ruled by\nThingol lay secure within the Girdle of Melian in their realm of\nDoriath. At the outflow of Sirion into Belegaer, after the destruction\nof Eglarest and Brithombar, the Havens of Sirion were built by Círdan\nand his people."

It was an\neastern bay of the Inland Sea of Helcar, formed by the meltwaters of the\npillar of Illuin.\n\nAfter the First Age and the War of Wrath, the Sea of Helcar (and\nCuiviénen with it) was drained, leaving behind only the Sea of Núrnen\nand the Sea of Rhûn, prompting the Elvish adage “and to Cuiviénen there\nis no returning”; both a reference to physical geography and a metaphor\nfor the Sundering. While never confirmed, there is a small chance that\nit survives in a much truncated form.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn YT 1050, the Awakening of the Elves took place. The Elves dwelt\nhere for a long time in bliss under the starlight and were content.\nHere the elves were divided into their three basic groups: the Minyar\n(Vanyar), Tatyar (Ñoldor), and Nelyar (Teleri), here they learned and\ndeveloped the basic skills of survival, culture, and language.\n\nUnfortunately, Melkor discovered this land first before the other Valar.\nMany elves feared him and they were forced to hide, and those\nunfortunate enough to be left behind or overwhelmed by fear and\nunhappiness were taken or slain. Then, years later, Oromë discovered\nCuiviénen on his travels throughout Middle-earth. Oromé reported his\ndiscovery back to the Valar in Valinor and after some debate they\ndecided that the Elves would be safer living in The Undying Lands, in\nthe peace and protection of the Valar. Oromé returned to Cuiviénen and\nthere spoke with the Elves regarding their removal to Valinor. The first\nSundering of the Elves then took place when the Eldar, name that was\ngiven by Oromé to the Elves using their own tongue, departed from\nCuiviénen to Valinor. Some of these Elves refused to leave through fear\nof the unknown, turned back after reaching the huge range of The Misty\nMountains, or simply decided to stay in Arda through choice.\n\nIt is unknown how long the remaining Avari remained at Cuiviénen during\nthe First Age, but they were there when Men awoke at the first rising of\nthe Sun in the nearby land of Hildórien, and its elven residents\nbefriended early Men and apparently taught them the basic skills of\nsurvival.\n\nOther mentions\n\nIn his attempt to sway the Ñoldor to join him in pursuit of Melkor to\nMiddle-earth, Fëanor spoke of the “sweet waters” of Cuiviénen that they\nhad left in vain to travel to Aman.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nCUIVIÉNEN is a Quenya word that means “Water of Awakening” from\n_cuivié_ (“awakening”) and _nen_ (“water”).",

The Ñoldor, led by Fëanor and his sons, tried to persuade\ntheir friends, the Teleri of Alqualondë, to give him their ships.\nHowever, the Teleri would not help in any way against the will of the\nValar, and in fact attempted to persuade their friends to reconsider and\nstay in Aman.

Ulmo\nuprooted it and with the help of his servants used it as a ferry to\ntransport the willing three kindreds of the Elves back and forth twice\nfrom Middle-earth to Aman. After that, the host of Olwë remembering the\nstar-light of their home in eastern Middle-earth begged to the Maia Ossë\nto stay their journey. Their request was granted at the behest of Ulmo.\nOssë rooted it permanently to the bottom of the sea, and never moved\nagain afterwards. The isle came to rest forever just off the eastern\nshore of Aman in the Bay of Eldamar, and the Teleri dwelt there ever\nafter. This long separation from the Vanyar and the Ñoldor caused the\nTelerin language to sunder from Quenya of the other Calaquendi. So that\nthe Teleri could see the light of Valinor, the Valar opened a cleft in\nthe Pelori so that the light of the Two Trees shone upon it, making its\nwestern shores green and fertile. Many Teleri lived here until their\nlord Olwë built the city Alqualondë on the northwestern shore of\nAman.\n\n\n\nWith the end of the First Age, many of the Eldar of Middle-earth exiles\ncame to it, and lived on the island of Tol Eressëa. Sometime during the\nearly Second Age, the Elves that chose to settle there built Avallonë in\nthe eastern part of the island. It was also where most of the elves\nvisiting Númenór came from at least until the shadow fell upon the\nNúmenóreans. The Númenóreans yearning for the light of the east would\noften gaze at the great tower of Avallonë, which they could see from the\nwesternmost parts of their homeland. When Ar-Pharazôn the Golden broke\nthe Ban of the Valar and sailed to the Undying Lands with his Great\nArmament, Tol Eressëa was surrounded by its fleets before going to\nTirion, but it is not known whether its people were assailed by this act\nor not.\n\n\nEarlier versions of the legendarium\n\nIn early versions of Tolkien's legendarium, the island was later visited\nby Ælfwine (or Eriol), an Englishman from the Middle Ages, which\nprovided a framework for the tales that later became _The Silmarillion_.\nOver time it had become a land of many beautiful places and interesting\nsites such as: Alalminórë, the Land of Elms, and Tavrobel. Along with\nUlmo, his great whale Uin was also in charge to carry the island to the\nBay of Eldamar.\n\nThe Cottage of Lost Play, which Eriol visited, was one of the more\nfamous spots in Tol Eressëa at which many stories were told (the stories\nthat became the _Lost Tales_) of ancient times.\n\nAt different eras of development of his mythology Tolkien either saw Tol\nEressëa as the island of Britain, or as the island of Avallon, off the\ncoast of Britain beyond the Straight Path near Valinor In some of the\nlater writings and letters he began to see the Shire and Rivendell to be\ncloser to England geographically. Some of the ideas of Avalon (and\nArthurian legend) that had been associated with the island can also be\nseen in the name of the city Avallonë. Tolkien even echoed this in a\nletter when he stated he had given Frodo and Bilbo an “Arthurian\nending”.\n\n    But when Morgoth was thrust forth, the Gods held council. The Elves\n    were summoned to return into the West, and such as obeyed dwelt\n    again in Eressëa, the Lonely Island, which was renamed Avallon: for\n    it is hard by Valinor.\n\n\nNotable dwellings\n\n-   Avallonë\n-   Cottage of Lost Play\n-   House of the Hundred Chimneys\n-   Kortirion",

One Éored was one\nhundredth of the Éoherë - the full muster of Rohan. The Riders of an\nÉored could serve for a term or on a permanent basis. Each Éored was led\nby a captain. In times of war or unrest, the Marshals of the Mark each\nhad a battle-ready Éored as part of his household which he could command\nat his discretion.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the first three hundred years of Rohan's existence, the term was\nused widely to describe any significant number of Riders. Under King\nFolcwine, the military of Rohan was reordered. Under Folcwine, one Éored\nwas made up of 120 riders including their captain. Each Éored was also\nsupposed to comprise one-hundredth of the whole Muster of Rohan, not\nincluding the household of the King.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nThe changes made by Folcwine continued through the time of the War of\nthe Ring. While the force commanded by Théoden King son of Thengel at\nthe Battle of the Pelennor Fields did not number much more than half of\n12,000 riders, it was possibly the largest riding of the Rohirrim in\nhistory.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Éomer, the Third Marshal of the Mark, defied\norders and led his Éored in pursuit of a band of orcs who had entered\nRohan from the Emyn Muil. In the battle between Éomer's men and the\norcs, fifteen Riders were killed. Éomer's Éored thus numbered only 105\nwhen they encountered Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli on February 30,\n3019.\n\nMerry Brandybuck and Éowyn, disguised as a Rider named Dernhelm, rode\nwith the Éored commanded by Elfhelm to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields\non March 15. When the Rohirrim charged onto the battlefield, Éomer led\nthe first Éored in the center while Elfhelm's Éored was on the right\nflank and Grimbold's was on the left flank and the other companies\nfollowed behind. King Theoden rode before them all.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, Éomer returned to Minas Tirith with an Éored\nof Rohan's fairest knights to escort the body of their slain King home\nfor burial.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Old English, the word ÉORED means “Cavalry, band, or troop”. It\nmay have also been dervied from _eoh_ (“horse”) and _rád_ (“riding”)."

However, other writings of Tolkien have more to say: In\nTolkien's _Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age_ we are told that\naside from Curunír (Saruman), Mithrandir (Gandalf), and Radagast, there\nwere “others of the Istari who went into the east of Middle-earth, and\ndo not come into these tales.” Tolkien also writes in _Unfinished\nTales_ that the two Wizards were sent to the East. Their names in\nValinor were _ALATAR_ and _PALLANDO_, and they were Maiar of the Vala\nOromë.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn a letter,\nTolkien says that these two wizards went into the East, and likely\nfailed their mission, perhaps having started magical cults. However,\nall of this changes in a text written in the last year or two of\nTolkien's life. An alternate set of names are given - MORINEHTAR and\nRÓMESTÁMO (or _Rome(n)star_), Darkness-slayer and East-helper.

Their\nmission was directed at weakening Sauron's forces in the eastern part of\nMiddle-earth.

As such, there were usually three Marshals.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe first Marshal's charge was the King's lands. These included Folde\nand Harrowdale, and the muster also of Edoras, the capital. The second\nMarshal was usually charged with the West-Mark, including the Fords of\nIsen, a pivotal location in Rohan's defense during the War of the Ring.\nThe Hornburg (Helm's Deep) was the base of the West-Mark's Marshal. The\nEast-Mark often went to the third Marshal. His headquarters were at\nAldburg, once the home of Eorl the Young, first King of the Mark. The\nsecond and third Marshals, however, were interchangeable, and were\nassigned based on need by the King.\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring, Théoden King son of Thengel still\nheld loosely the title of first Marshal. During his youth, he had\nenjoyed leading the Muster of Edoras, but as he fell under the\ngrowing shadow of Saruman, and his servant Wormtongue, Théoden began to\nneglect his charges and duties as a Marshal. The second Marshal and\ncommander of the Westfold was Théodred, son and heir of Théoden. Éomer\nson of Éomund, nephew of the King, was the third Marshal, and filled his\nfather's post as commander of the East-Mark. Due to Théoden's condition,\nthe de facto commander at Edoras was Elfhelm, who acted as a Marshal of\nthe Mark. Háma, the loyal captain of the King's guard, was also at the\ncapital.\n\nWhen war with Saruman began, Théodred assumed command of Rohan's army,\ndespite the orders of his father speaking through his wicked counsellor\nGríma. Théodred ordered a muster to Edoras and soon led a good portion\nof the King's riders west to strengthen the Fords of Isen against\ninvasion. Later, Éomer defied the King and led his Éored (riders of his\nown household, his personal guard) to remove the herdfolk of the\nEast-Mark behind the fens of Entwash. There he encountered the Orcs\nreturning to Isengard from the Falls of Rauros, and later Aragorn,\nLegolas and Gimli.\n\nDuring the battles of the Lord of the Rings, the renewed Théoden assumed\ncommand of the army. With Théodred slain, Éomer acted as first Marshal.\nElfhelm led the muster of Eastfold, while Grimbold, previously a captain\nand hero of the battles at the Fords of Isen, commanded the riders of\nWestfold. After the War of the Ring was ended, Éomer King reordered the\npositions of the Marshals. He himself commanded the Muster of Rohan, and\ncaused the position of first Marshal to be held ever by the King or, in\nthe case of age or sickness, the King's heir (assuming the King had at\nleast another clear claimant to the throne). The positions of second and\nthird Marshal were largely dissolved, replaced by the titles Marshal of\nthe East-Mark and of the West-Mark.\n\nde:Marschall der Riddermark ru:Маршал Рохана"

It explained why\nThorin and Gandalf have to retake the Lonely Mountain, and it is an\nadventure recounted from the perspective of Bilbo Baggins.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nGandalf knew that Smaug could pose a serious threat if used by Sauron in\nwar, then dwelling in Dol Guldur in Mirkwood. He was thinking about the\nmatter when he met Thorin Oakenshield at Bree. Thorin also was concerned\nabout Smaug, but had the different motive of revenge and the reclaiming\nof the Dwarves' treasure in the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf agreed to help\nThorin.\n\nGandalf thought Bilbo, an unlikely choice, to be a suitable companion of\nThorin and his Dwarves for a number of reasons. First, he had observed\nthat Bilbo took an interest in the world at large, and was thus\nadventurous. Another reason is that Smaug would not recognize the scent\nof a Hobbit, advantageous to a stealthy operation. Thorin also did not\nthink highly of Hobbits, and putting Bilbo in the expedition might\nprevent the proud Thorin from rash actions — such as openly challenging\nSmaug.\n\nIt was Thorin's objections to Bilbo that Gandalf found most difficult to\novercome. Thorin believed that Bilbo was incapable of helping their\nadventure and that Gandalf might be simply meddling in his affairs for\nhis own reasons. After much debate, Gandalf convinced Thorin that Bilbo\nwould be a worthy member. It could be thought that Gandalf arranged this\nas he has foreseen the later event and wanted to create another front to\nfight Sauron.\n\nThe Quest\n\nThe Company started from the Shire to the Trollshaws. Three\nStone-trolls, Tom, William and Bert caught them. Luckily, they were\nsaved by Gandalf, by slamming the ground that hid the Troll cave from\nthe sunlight, thus turning them to stone. Then they passed the Hidden\nValley and arrived in Rivendell. They left Gandalf behind with the White\nCouncil and went to High Pass. After being saved by Gandalf again in\nGoblin-town, they were hunted by Bolg's wargs. They were saved by\nGwaihir and the other Great Eagles. After having a night in Beorn's\nhouse, they went to Mirkwood. Thranduil caught them and locked them in\nthe cells. While, Bilbo, who was wearing the Ring, he saved the Company\nby Barrels. And they found Bard who brought them to Lake-town. They\ntempted the Master of Laketown and they successfully reached the Lonely\nMountain.\n\n\nThe Quest in The Lord of the Rings\n\n“The Quest of Erebor” was originally written in the 1950s to be a part\nof _The Lord of the Rings_ but Tolkien decided not to include it, and\nonly a very abridged version of the tale occurred in the Appendices.\nThere are two manuscripts extant of the work. Both are written in the\nfirst person, from the perspective of Frodo Baggins. However, nearly all\nof the text consists of narration by Gandalf, who was telling the story\nat the request of Frodo in Minas Tirith after the coronation of King\nAragorn II Elessar in _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\n\nNotes\n\n-   The Quest caused Battle of Five Armies and indirectly caused the War\n    of the Ring.\n"

The first Elf to awake was called\nIMIN (“First”). Next to him lay IMINYË, who would become his wife. Near\nwhere Imin woke, awoke TATA (“Second”) and TATIË, and ENEL (“Third”) and\nENELYË.\n\nImin, Tata, and Enel and their wives joined up and walked through the\nforests. They first came across six pairs of Elves, and Imin, as eldest,\nclaimed them as his people, and woke them. After a short time Imin and\nhis people, together with Tata and Enel, continued their journey. Next,\nthey came across nine pairs of Elves, and Tata as second eldest, claimed\nthem as his people. After a short time the now thirty-six Elves\ncontinued their journey. Then they found twelve pairs of Elves, and\nEnel, as third eldest, claimed them as his people.\n\nFor many days the now sixty Elves dwelt by the rivers, and they began to\ninvent poetry and music.\n\nFinally they set out again, but Imin thought to himself that since each\ntime they had found more Elves and his folk was least in size, he would\nnow choose last.\n\nThey came across eighteen pairs of Elves, who were watching the stars,\nand Tata and Enel waited for Imin to claim them for his people, but Imin\ntold them he would wait, so Tata added them to his folk. They were tall\nand had dark hair, and they were the fathers of most of the Ñoldor of\nlater times.\n\nThe ninety-six Elves now spoke with each other and invented many new\nwords, but then they continued their journey. Next they found\ntwenty-four pairs of Elves, who were singing without language, and again\nImin was offered the choice, but refused. Therefore Enel chose them as\nhis people, and from them came most of the Lindar or singers of later\ntimes.\n\nAnd the hundred and forty-four Elves now dwelt long together, until all\nhad learned the same language, and they were glad. But then Imin said it\nwas time to seek more companions for him, but most of the others were\ncontent and did not join him. So Imin and Iminyë and their twelve\ncompanions set out alone, and they searched long near Cuiviénen, but\nnever found any more companions.\n\nAnd because all Elves had been found in groups of twelve, twelve became\nthe number they counted with ever after, and 144 was for long their\nhighest number, and in none of their later tongues was there therefore\nany common name for a greater number.\n\nAfter the tale of the Awakening of the Elves the _Companions of Imin_ or\nthe Eldest Company (the later Vanyar) numbered fourteen, and they\nremained the smallest company. The _Companions of Tata_ (half of whom\nbecame the Ñoldor) numbered fifty-six, and they remained the\nsecond-largest company. The _Companions of Enel_ (the later Lindar or\nTeleri) were the largest company, numbering seventy-four.\n\nMelkor was the first to learn of the Awakening. He soon began sending\nevil spirits among the Elves, who planted seeds of doubt against the\nValar. It is also rumoured that some of the Elves were being captured by\na Rider if they strayed too far, and the Elves later believed these were\nbrought to Utumno and twisted into Orcs.\n\nOromë one day came across the Elves, and realized who they were. At\nfirst the Elves were suspicious of him, fearing he was the Rider who\ncaptured the Elves, and because of the lies of Melkor. Nevertheless,\nthree lords of the Elves agreed to come with Oromë to Valinor. These\nwere Ingwë of the _Minyar_ (later _Vanyar_), Finwë of the _Tatyar_\n(later _Ñoldor_), and Elwë of the _Lindar_. In due time, Ingwë, Finwë\nand Elwë returned to Cuivienen, and told the Elves of the glory of\nValinor, and there befell the Sundering of the Elves. All the Minyar and\nhalf of the Tatyar were persuaded, along with most of the Lindar, and\nfollowed Oromë into the west on the Great Journey. These have been known\never since by the name Eldar, or “Star-folk”, which Oromë gave to them\nin their own language. The remainder of the Tatyar and Lindar remained\nsuspicious, or simply refused to depart from their own lands, and spread\ngradually throughout the wide lands of Middle-earth. They were after\nknown by the name Avari, meaning 'the Unwilling', because they refused\nthe summons, in Quenya, the language of the Eldar that eventually\nreached Valinor.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe tale of Imin, Tata and Enel, known as _CUIVIENYARNA_, was a very\nlate writing by Tolkien, written as part of _Quendi and Eldar_. They\nreplaced Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë as the eldest Elves, who now merely\nbecame the first ambassadors and the Kings of the Elves in exile.\n\nit:Risveglio degli Elfi ru:Пробуждение эльфов"

It was a dense, sparsely populated\nBeech forest.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBrethil was probably originally part of Doriath during most of the Years\nof the Trees. When the Girdle of Melian was set after the First Battle,\nthe Forest of Brethil was not included in it and was for the most part\nunsettled. However, King Thingol still held lordship over it.\n\nWhen Men came into the Beleriand, King Thingol gave his permission for\nsome of their peoples to settle there so long as they defended it. It\nwas to Brethil that the House of Haleth removed after dwelling east of\nthe river Gelion, settling mainly on the Hill of Amon Obel where upon\nstood Ephel Brandir, the main feature of the forest. They defended it\nfrom the Orcs until the late fifth century of the First Age, when much\nof their number was lost including their Lord Handir in a raid by the\nenemy. Some Drúedain also dwelt there.\n\nThe Haladin came to Brethil from the lands of Caranthir by way of\nEstolad. They had endured much hardship upon their long journey, but\nbegan to recover and multiply in the isolated forest. There they formed\nan alliance with Elu Thingol, King of Doriath. At need, Thingol sent\nBeleg Cúthalion with great force of his Sindarin Elves west to fight\nalongside Halmir son of Haldan, Lord of the Haladin. The combined force\ndestroyed a legion of Orcs, and the realm had peace for a time. Later,\nmany of the Woodmen of Brethil joined the muster of Húrin son of Galdor,\nclose kin of their lord Haldir, son of Halmir, and took part in the\nNirnaeth Arnoediad.\n\nAfter the disastrous battle, the Haladin became even more reclusive.\nMany withdrew to Ephel Brandir, the home of their lord Brandir the Lame,\nupon Amon Obel. Years later, Túrin Turambar son of Húrin was brought to\nEphel Brandir, and became the de facto lord of the Haladin. The tragedy\nof the Children of Hurin ensnared the Haladin, and the forest was\neventually attacked by Glaurung, father of Dragons. He burnt a path\ndirectly towards Ephel Brandir, but Túrin managed to slay him at\nCabed-en-Aras upon Teiglin with his mighty sword Gurthang. Returning\ntowards Ephel Brandir, Túrin learned the truth about his wife Níniel,\nand he, Níniel and Brandir all perished. The final stroke of doom for\nthe Haladin in Brethil came when Húrin returned to Amon Obel and sparked\na civil war, which destroyed the bloodline of the House of Haldad.\n\nTúrin Turambar came here after the destruction of Nargothrond and a\nvisit to Dor-lómin to rest not long before his fight with Glaurung. The\nForest was Túrin's burial place as well Nienor Níniel and Morwen, as\nwell as the Haudh-en-Elleth, the mound of Finduilas. The grave of Túrin\nand Morwen, survived the ruin of Beleriand after the First Age, and thus\ndid a speck of the Forest of Brethil still exist as Tol Morwen.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Brethil_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Silver birch'."

    "text": "The BLUE MOUNTAINS or ERED LUIN, also known as ERED LINDON, was a\nmountain range situated in the far west of Eriador.\n\n\nHistory\n\nEarly Arda\n\nThe Blue Mountains arose sometime after the tumultuous chaos caused by\nMelkor's destruction of the Two Lamps that destroyed the perfect\nsymmetry of Arda. In these early days, the Blue Mountains were located\nbetween the newly formed great sea of Belegaer and the newly formed Sea\nof Helcar. The Blue Mountains were connected to the Iron Mountains to\nthe north and the Red Mountains in the east which formed one great\nmountain range chain known by different names. The Ancient Grey\nMountains were to its south separated by a great gap.\n\nEldar Days\n\nDuring the Years of the Trees and the Sleep of Yavanna, the Blue\nMountains was an unbroken line separating Eriador from Beleriand. Seven\nrivers arose in it on the western side, and the land these rivers flowed\nthrough was known as Ossiriand, which was later also known as Lindon,\ntherefore the mountains were sometimes referred to as the Ered Lindon.\nDwarven kinfolk either awoke here or migrated here from other awakening\npoints and delved the cities of Belegost and Nogrod and made contact and\nalliance with the Sindar of Thingol.\n\nSecond Age\n\nThe mountain range was broken during the war of the Valar against\nMorgoth, and at the middle of the range the sea broke through, creating\na great gap where was set the Gulf of Lune a new terminus for the river\nLune. In the middle of the gap, where the Lune met the sea, the Grey\nHavens of Mithlond of the Elven Kingdom of Lindon were built. When seen\nas the border of Lindon the Ered Luin were called Ered Lindon.\n\n\n\nThird Age and beyond\n\nDuring the Third Age, its forests, besides that of Mirkwood, were the\nlargest in Middle-earth. In the latter part of the Third Age, the\nDwarves settled the Blue Mountains again when Thráin II and his son\nThorin and the Dwarven survivors of the Sack of Erebor moved from\nDunland and delved a prosperous settlement there. After the War of\nthe Ring and the defeat of Sauron, Elves continued to travel west to\nLindon through the gap in the mountains by way of the Gulf of Lune,\nwhere they eventually intended to set sail on the Straight Road to the\nUndying Lands of Aman. After the War of the Ring it is said that many\nDwarves from the east migrated back to their ancient homeland and Ered\nLuin was a prosperous kingdom oncemore.\n\n\nInhabitants\n\nDwarves\n\nThe Blue Mountains, the Iron Hills, and Lonely Mountain were the main\nareas of Dwarf colonization by the late Third Age. During the 4000+\nyears following the cataclysmic sundering and catastrophic downfall of\nBeleriand, when the mighty Dwarf fortress-cities of Nogrod and Belegost\nwere inundated by the sea, it is possible that the Dwarves rebuilt those\ncities to their former splendor.\n\n\n\nThe Dwarves would have plundered the mines of the Blue Mountains for the\nhoard of resources it held within the depths of darkness at its roots. \n\nBefore setting off in their quest to the Lonely Mountain, Thorin\nOakenshield and his twelve other companions (as well as other Dwarves of\nthe Lonely Mountain) resided here in the Blue Mountains after being\nrendered homeless by the Dragon Smaug.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, many Dwarves from the eastern kingdoms\nmigrated back to the Blue Mountains. Their population grew and the Blue\nMountains became a prosperous kingdom once again.\n\nElves\n\nIt is shown in several maps made of Middle-earth that vast ancient\nforests flanked both sides of the Blue Mountains, even after the\ngargantuan slaughter of Eriador's great forests by the men of Númenor\nand their incessant appetite for lumber. These forests, alongside the\nfertile coastal plain, would prove to be hotspots for Elven migration\nand inhabitation.\n\n\n\nIt is stated at the very beginning of _The Hobbit_ that the High Elves\nlived within the vales and forests of the Blue Mountains, presumably\nsharing the land with the Dwarves. To this number would be added Sindar,\nWood-elves, and maybe even a few Avari.\n\nThe influx of new Elven settlers soared after the end of the First Age\nwho lived under the Ñoldor High King Gil-galad in the Second Age.\nAfter the fall of Gil-galad in the Third Age, the foot of the Blue\nMountains became part of Lindon where Elves lived temporarily until they\nleft for the Undying Lands, due to the Elves desiring to escape the woes\nand predicaments of Middle-earth.\n\n\nGeology\n\nAlthough the Blue Mountains were little described (owing to their\nlocation on the fringes of all of Tolkien's tales), we can assume a bit\nof their geology. The outer layers of the mountains seem to have been\nunderlaid by metamorphic rocks formed in contact with numerous igneous\nintrusions. This environment is often necessary to produce veins of ore\nsuch as those mined by the Dwarves from the beginning of time. This\nenvironment produced the trove of Gold, Silver, Iron, Gems, and other\nmaterials that made the Dwarf kingdoms incredibly wealthy.\n\nThe Blue mountains were shorter than the Misty Mountains, and not as\nhigh; their altitude was probably around 3000-4000 meters, on average.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe Sindarin name for the mountains, _ERED LUIN_ is translated as the\nwords _ered_ ('Mountains') and _luin_ ('Blue'). \n",

The Paths then continued past forgotten\ncities, emerging at the southern end of the White Mountains in Morthond\nvale, near the Stone of Erech.\n\nIn the Second Age, a people related to the Dunlendings had lived in the\nWhite Mountains, and they had for a time served the Dark Lord Sauron.\nThey later swore allegiance to Isildur of Gondor and Arnor, but betrayed\nhim during the Last Alliance of Elves and Men and refused to fight on\neither side. For this reason, Isildur cursed them, proclaiming that, if\nthe Alliance triumphed, they would linger in the mountains until one of\nhis heirs called them again to fight against Sauron.\n\nIsildur's curse succeeded: their people dwindled and eventually died\nout, until only their ghosts remained at the end of the Third Age.

    "page_id": "2652",
    "text": "The HISTORY OF ARDA is divided into three time periods, known as the\nYears of the Lamps, Years of the Trees and Years of the Sun. A separate,\noverlapping chronology divides the history into 'Ages of the Children of\nIlúvatar'. The first such Age began with the Awakening of the Elves\nduring the Years of the Trees and continued for the first six centuries\nof the Years of the Sun. All the subsequent Ages took place during the\nYears of the Sun. Most Middle-earth stories take place in the first\nthree Ages of the Children of Ilúvatar.\n\n\nBasic history\n\nMusic of the Ainur\n\n_Main article: Ainulindalë_\n\nThe supreme deity is called Eru Ilúvatar. In the beginning, Ilúvatar\ncreated spirits named the Ainur. Ilúvatar made divine music with them.\nMelkor, Tolkien's equivalent of Satan, who was then one of the Ainur,\nbroke the harmony of the music, until Ilúvatar began a third theme which\nthe Ainur could not comprehend since they were not the source of it. The\nessence of their song symbolized the history of the whole universe and\nthe Children of Ilúvatar who were to dwell in it - the Men and the\nElves.\n\nThen Ilúvatar created Eä, the universe itself, and the Ainur formed\nwithin it Arda, the Earth, “globed within the void”: the world together\nwith the airs is set apart from _Kuma_, the “void” without. The first 15\nof the Ainur who descended to Arda, and the most powerful ones, were\ncalled Valar, and the Ainur of lesser might who followed were called\nMaiar.\n\nYears of the Lamps\n\n_Main article: Years of the Lamps_\n\nThe Years of the Lamps began shortly after the creation of Arda by the\nValar. After the Valar entered the world, there was a light veiling the\nground. The Valar took this light and concentrated it into two large\nlamps, Iluin and Ormal. The Vala Aulë forged great towers, one in the\nfurthest north, and another in the deepest south. The Valar lived in the\nmiddle, at the island of Almaren. The end of the Years of the Lamps was\nmarked by Melkor's destruction of the Two Lamps.\n\nYears of the Trees\n\n_Main article: Years of the Trees_\n\nShortly after the destruction of the Two Lamps, Yavanna made the Two\nTrees, named Telperion (the silver tree) and Laurelin (the gold tree) in\nthe land of Aman, where the Valar now lived. The Trees illuminated Aman,\nleaving Middle-earth in darkness, save the light of the stars.\n\nThe Elves awoke in Cuiviénen, and were soon approached by the Valar, but\nalso by Melkor. This event marked the beginning of the First Age. Many,\nthough not all, of the Elves were persuaded to go on the Great Journey\nwestwards towards Aman. Along the journey several groups of Elves\ntarried, notably the Nandor and the Sindar. The three clans who arrived\nat Aman were the Vanyar, Ñoldor, and the Teleri.\n\nThe Valar had captured Melkor and placed him in chains in Aman. After he\nappeared to repent and was released, Melkor sowed great discord among\nthe elves, and stirred up rivalry between the Ñoldorin King Finwë's two\nsons Fëanor and Fingolfin. Out of jealousy and hatred for the Silmarils\nthree gems crafted by Feänor that contained the light of the Two Trees\nMelkor stole them, killing Finwë, who was guarding the jewels. Then,\nwith the help of the creature Ungoliant, he destroyed the Two Trees and\nescaped to Middle-earth.\n\nBitter at the Valar's inactivity, Feänor and his house left to pursue\nMelkor, cursing him with the name 'Morgoth'. A larger host, commanded by\nFingolfin, followed him. They reached the Telerin port-city of\nAlqualondë, but their Lord forbade them to use the Telerin ships. Feänor\ndecided to take them by force and thus the first Kinslaying ensued and\nonly by the strength in numbers were the Teleri overcome and their fair\nships stolen.\n\nFeänor's host sailed on the vessels, and burned them when he arrived in\nMiddle-earth. Left behind, Fingolfin and his company crossed over to\nMiddle-earth through the Helcaraxë (also known as the Grinding Ice) in\nthe far north. Around the same time, but separately, Galadriel and\nCeleborn set sail for Middle-earth without the permission of the Valar.\n\nYears of the Sun\n\nThe Years of the Sun began when the Valar made the Sun and the Moon out\nof the final fruit of Laurelin and the final flower of Telperion and set\nthem in the heavens. Thereafter, years were reckoned in Middle-earth as\nthey are in our own real world. The First Age of the Children of\nIlúvatar continued into this new reckoning of time.\n\nAges of the Children of Ilúvatar\n\nFirst Age\n\n_Main article: First Age_\n\nFeänor was soon lost in an attack on Morgoth's Balrog s - but his sons\nsurvived, and founded realms the kingdoms of the House of Fingolfin.\n\nThe Long Peace lasted hundreds of years; during which time Men arrived\nover the Blue Mountains, but the peace was not to last; and one by one\nthe kingdoms even the hidden ones of Gondolin and Doriath eventually\nfell.\n\nAt the end of the age, all that remained of free Elves and Men in\nBeleriand was a settlement at the mouth of the River Sirion and another\nsettlement on the isle of Balar. Eärendil had possession of a Silmaril,\nwhich his wife Elwing's ancestors Beren and Lúthien had taken from\nMorgoth, but the Feänorians had a claim on the Silmaril still and so\nthere was another Kinslaying. Eärendil and Elwing took the Silmaril\nacross the Great Sea, to beg the Valar for aid.\n\nThey responded. Melkor was exiled into the Void; and most of his works\nwere destroyed. This came at a terrible cost, as Beleriand itself was\nsunk.\n\nSecond Age\n\n_Main article: Second Age_\n\nThe men who had remained faithful were given the island of Númenor, in\nthe middle of the Great Sea whilst the Elves were allowed to return\nhome.\n\nThe Númenóreans became great seafarers, but were jealous of the elves\nfor their immortality. Meanwhile, in Middle-earth it became apparent\nthat Sauron, Morgoth's chief servant, was still active. He worked with\nElven smiths in Eregion on the craft of rings, and forged the One Ring\nto dominate them all. The Elves noticed this and removed theirs.\n\nTowards the end of the age, the Númenóreans were growing increasingly\nproud. King Ar-Pharazôn humbled even Sauron and brought him to Númenor\nas a hostage. Sauron worked his way into Pharazôn's court, and became\nhigh priest in a cult of Morgoth. Eventually, Pharazôn was persuaded to\nattempt to invade Aman, promised that immortality would result.\n\nAmandil, chief of the Faithful, sailed westward to warn the Valar of\nthis. His son Elendil and grandsons Isildur and Anárion prepared to flee\neastwards. When the King's men had landed on Aman, the Valar lay down\ntheir guardianship of the world and called for Ilúvatar to intervene.\n\nThe world was changed into a sphere, and the straight road from\nMiddle-earth to Aman was broken. Númenor was utterly destroyed, as was\nthe fair body of Sauron. Elendil and his sons founded the realms of\nGondor and Arnor.\n\nSauron arose again and challenged them. The Elves allied with the Men to\nform the Last Alliance, which defeated him. His great One Ring was taken\nfrom him by Isildur but not destroyed.\n\nThird Age\n\n_Main article: Third Age_\n\nThe Third Age saw the rise in power of the realms of Arnor and Gondor,\nand their fall. Arnor was divided into three petty Kingdoms, which fell\none by one, whilst Gondor fell into the civil war of the Kin-strife,\nplague, Wainriders, and the Corsairs of Umbar.\n\nBy the time of _The Lord of the Rings_, Sauron had recovered again, and\nwas seeking the One Ring. He discovered that it was in the possession of\na Hobbit named Baggins, and sent out the Ringwraiths to find him and\nretrieve it.\n\nThe Ring-bearer, Frodo Baggins, is sent to Rivendell, where it is\ndecided that the One Ring must be destroyed once and for all and it can\nonly be unmade in the fiery depths of Mount Doom where it was forged. He\nsets out on this quest with eight other companions who comprise _The\nFellowship of the Ring_.\n\nAfter a long and difficult journey, he and Sam Gamgee finally complete\nthe mission, succeeding largely due to an unforeseen event that was out\nof their control. Sauron is thus destroyed forever and they are lauded\nas heroes.\n\nAragorn takes his place as King of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and\nGondor, at last restoring the line of Kings from the Stewards of Gondor.\n\nFourth Age and After\n\n_Main article: Fourth Age_\n\nThe end of the Third Age marked the end of the involvement of the Elves\nin Human affairs, despite a short-lived revival of Elven presence in\nGondor under Legolas. Most Elves who have lingered in Middle-earth leave\nfor Valinor. Those who remain behind “fade” and eventually diminish; a\nsimilar fate occurs for the Dwarves. Although Lonely Mountain (Erebor)\nbecomes an ally of the Reunited Kingdom, there are indications\nKhazad-dûm is refounded, and a colony is established under Gimli in the\nWhite Mountains (Ered Nimrais). The dwarves become ever more reclusive\nand disappear from human history. Morgoth's creatures are almost wiped\nout and never recover. During the later Fourth Age, as the heirs of the\nNúmenóreans forget their heritage, the tales of the earlier Ages become\nlegends and are eventually considered fantasies.\n\nSince then, Tolkien wrote that the ages have quickened, and he estimated\nthat the 20th century was in the Sixth or Seventh age.\n\nit:Storia di Arda ru:История Арды"

    "text": "_'_The Book of Lost Tales Part One _'_(sometimes here abbreviated\n_THE BOOK OF LOST TALES 1_) (ISBN 978-0345375216) is the title of the\nfirst volume of Christopher Tolkien's 12-volume series _The History of\nMiddle-earth_, in which he analyses the unpublished manuscripts of his\nfather J. R. R. Tolkien.\n\nIt was completed in 1983. ''The Book of Lost Tales Part Two ''is its\nsequel and other half, which came a year later.\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nContent\n\n_The Book of Lost Tales_ contains the first versions of the stories\nwhich would later become _The Silmarillion_, and is notable because,\nwhile very primitive in style and content, it is very close to the later\nwork in many ways. Each of the Tales is followed by notes and a detailed\ncommentary by Christopher Tolkien.\n\nWhile many of the names in the book are identical or close to those in\nthe later versions, some of them bear almost no resemblance to their\nfinal forms. J. R. R. Tolkien changed names rather frequently, sometimes\nwith several new variants (rejected in turn) written in a single\nmanuscript. Confusingly, sometimes the name applied to one thing is\nlater used to refer to a different thing, the original use abandoned. As\nan example, the house of Elves called “Teleri” in _The Book of Lost\nTales_ is not the same as that in _The Silmarillion_ (see Teleri). The\noriginal usage of “Teleri” would eventually change until the name became\n“Vanyar”. Meanwhile, the house of Elves called “Solosimpi” would inherit\nthe name “Teleri”.\n\nThe framework for the book is that a mortal Man visits the Isle of Tol\nEressëa where the Elves live. In the earlier versions of the “Lost\nTales” this man is named Eriol, of some vague north European origin, but\nin later versions he becomes Ælfwine, an Englishman of the Middle-ages.\n\nThere are more changes visible within the book, and it is not internally\nconsistent, partially because even while still writing it Tolkien began\nrewriting earlier parts as his ideas about the world changed. The Tales\nwere eventually abandoned, but they were resurrected in part as the\n“Sketch of the Mythology” which would become _The Silmarillion_.\n\nFor publication, the book was split into two volumes: _The Book of Lost\nTales Part One_ and _The Book of Lost Tales Part Two_, but this is\nsimply an editorial division. Both volumes are separated into several\n“Lost Tales”, as chapters.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1.  “The Cottage of Lost Play” — the “framework” story, recounting\n    Eriol's arrival to the place where the following stories are told\n2.  “The Music of the Ainur” — the first version of what would become\n    the Ainulindalë\n3.  “The Coming of the Valar and the Building of Valinor” — later\n    Valaquenta and the first chapters of Quenta Silmarillion\n4.  “The Chaining of Melko”\n5.  “The Coming of the Elves and the Making of Kôr”\n6.  “The Theft of Melko and the Darkening of Valinor”\n7.  “The Flight of the Noldoli”\n8.  “The Tale of the Sun and Moon”\n9.  “The Hiding of Valinor”\n10. “Gilfanon's Tale: The Travail of the Noldoli and the Coming of\n    Mankind” (which contains the first and only reference to the\n    enigmatic “wizard” fay, Tu)\n\n\nComparison with The Silmarillion\n\nThe following is a direct comparison between the contents of the early\nBOOK OF LOST TALES and the later sketches that became THE SILMARILLION.\n\nAlthough one of the _Lost Tales_ often corresponds to more tales from\n_The Silmarillion_, still the narrative in the _Lost Tales_ is more\nextended (typically, 50% pages more).\n\nIn J. R. R. Tolkien's notebooks, the 4th and 5th tales were a single one\ntold by Meril-i-Turinqi, but Christopher Tolkien decided to separate\nthem because of their length. The same applies to the 6th and 7th tales,\ntold by Lindo.\n\n+-----------------------------+---------+-----------------------------+\n| The Book of Lost Tales      | _Storyt | The Silmarillion            |\n|                             | eller_  |                             |\n+=============================+=========+=============================+\n|                             |         |                             |\n+-----------------------------+---------+-----------------------------+\n| Book I                      |\n+-----------------------------+---------+-----------------------------+\n| 1.

On the western slopes of the Orocarni grew\nthe _Wild Wood_, near a great waterfall of a river that flowed into the\nInland Sea of Helcar where the bay of Cuiviénen lay, where the Elves\nwoke. At their northern edge the Orocarni connected with the Iron\nMountains resembling the Blue Mountains in the far west. One of the\nrivers that arose in the Orocarni flowed into the inland Sea of Rhûn.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFour of the seven Fathers of the Dwarves awoke in the range in the Years\nof the Trees. After the end of the First Age, the Orocarni remained, and\nran through the center of the land of Rhûn. They were home to the\nDwarven clans of the Ironfists, Blacklocks, Stonefoots, and Stiffbeards.\nThe Ironfists and Stiffbeards lived in the T-shaped northern half while\nthe Blacklocks and Stonefoots lived in the backwards-C-shaped southern\nhalf. It is _not_ explained by Tolkien who lives in the far-north,\ncenter-north, center-south, or far-south quarters. However, the most\nprobable theory is that the Stiffbeards lived in the far-northern\nOrocarni, the Ironfists lived in the center-northern Orocarni, the\nStonefoots lived in the center-southern Orocarni, and the Blacklocks\nlived in the far-southern Orocarni.\n\nDuring his travels in Middle-earth, Oromë stood under the shadow of the\nOrocarni and from there he first heard the singing of the Elves in\nCuiviénen thus finding the Firstborn of Eru Ilúvatar for the first\ntime.\n\nConcerning Elven folk, the Dark Elves lived in the forests bordering\nthese mountains, and likely had similar capital cities to the one of\nLothlórien and the one of Mirkwood, and similar architecture, as well.\n\nBecause the Orocarni were far to the east, they were not visited by the\nEldar, and the Edain did not reach them until the Fourth Age. The\nOrocarni do not appear in any of the tales of the _Red Book of\nWestmarch_. However, it is known that the mountains were extremely rich\nwith every kind of mineral, bursting at the seams with them.",

    "text": "During Gandalf's fight with the Balrog in _The Lord of the Rings_, he\nsays of himself that he is the wielder of the Flame of Anor. It is\nnowhere else referred to in the trilogy, so its particular meaning\nremains unclear. _Anor_ is the Elvish word for the Sun, so literally the\n_flame of Anor_ would have alluded to the light of the Sun, which had\noriginated in the fiery fruit of Laurelin, one of the Two Trees of\nValinor. Thus, Gandalf may have meant the power he gained as a servant\n(a Maia) of the Lords of the West, in defiance to the corrupted darkness\nof the Balrog.\n\nAlternatively, Gandalf may have been referring to Narya, the Ring of\nFire, which he wore and wielded, but it seems unlikely that Gandalf\nwould want to reveal his ownership of a Ring of Power —a matter of\nutmost secrecy—to one of his greatest enemies. However, considering that\nthe Balrog owed no allegiance to Sauron at that time, Gandalf may have\nbeen merely attempting to scare it away.\n\nIn Tolkien's earliest drafts, forms of this passage were variations on:\n“I am the master of White Flame. The Red Fire cannot come this way” (and\none variation mixes in the idea of Black Shadow, too). These terms seem\nto be symbolic - _white_ for the powers of good, but _red_ or _black_\nfor Sauron and his servants. As the text developed, the _Red Fire_ and\n_Black Shadow_ were lost. The _White Flame_ remained, but developed into\nthe more poetic _flame of Anor._ On this reading, then, the 'flame of\nAnor' doesn't refer to a specific thing, but is Gandalf's way of\nannouncing what he stands for, or perhaps his power as a servant of the\nValar."

    "text": "The FATHERS OF THE DWARVES were the first seven of the founding fathers\nof the Dwarven race.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Vala Aulë created the Dwarves because he was impatient for the\narising of the Children of Ilúvatar (Elves and Men). He created seven\nDwarves, and was teaching them the language he had devised for them.\nWhen Ilúvatar confronted him about what he had done, Aulë offered his\ncreations to Ilúvatar, who accepted them and gave them life.\n\nHowever, the Fathers of the Dwarves had to wait until the Elves first\narrived, and Aulë laid them to rest in various places in the continent\nof Middle-earth.\n\nThe eldest of all, Durin, “lay alone” at Mount Gundabad in the north of\nthe Misty Mountains. He later founded the line of the Longbeards (or\n_Sigin-tarâg_ in Khuzdul), the Dwarves which were most friendly to the\nElves and Men, mostly referred to as Durin's Folk. His city was\nKhazad-dûm.\n\nTwo others were laid to rest near Mount Dolmed in the Blue Mountains,\nand they founded the lines of the Broadbeams and the Firebeards who\nlater lived in Nogrod and Belegost.\n\nThe other four Fathers of Dwarves were laid to rest in the far east, two\nof them at the northern end of the Orocarni, and the other two near the\nsouthern end of the range. These founded the lines of the _Ironfists_\nand _Stiffbeards_, and _Blacklocks_ and _Stonefoots_. No Dwarves of\nthese lines appear in the tales: however, as noted below, the Longbeards\nmay be formed out of Dwarves from all lines, and Dwarves from Durin's\nFolk may therefore have ancestors from these other lines. After the end\nof the First Age, when the ancestral homes of the Broadbeams and\nFirebeards were destroyed, these two lines merged with Durin's Folk, so\nthat Moria had a mixed population, and Thorin Oakenshield grew up in the\nremnants of the Firebeards' halls.\n\nOf the Fathers of the Dwarves, only Durin is said to have “lain alone”.\nThis can be interpreted as referring to the fact he was indeed laid down\nto rest alone while the other Fathers were laid to rest in pairs, but\nolder versions of the story suggest that it meant Durin alone had no\nfemale companion. The other Fathers did: references are made by Tolkien\nto the “Thirteen Dwarves” created by Aulë (Durin and the six pairs). By\nthis version of the story, Durin's Folk was formed out of Dwarves from\nthe other six lines, as a mixed people arose when all Dwarves went to\nGundabad."

    "text": "The IRON MOUNTAINS, also known as ERED ENGRIN, and the MOUNTAINS OF IRON\nwere an immense mountain range in the northern part of Middle-earth.\n\nThe Iron Mountains have always been associated with bitterly cold\nclimates partly due to the influence of the evil Kingdom of Melkor.\nIt was also the former location of his ancient fortresses of Utumno and\nAngband.\n\n\nHistory\n\nAfter returning to Arda from the Outer Darkness with his allies through\nthe Door of Night, Melkor created the Iron Mountains and behind these\nwalls safe from the light of the northern lamp Illuin he delved the\ngreat fortress of Utumno. Angband was also delved into these mountains\nwest of Utumno. After Melkor's destruction of the Two Lamps, the Iron\nMountains were connected to the Blue Mountains of the West to the\nOrocarni of the east. Much later when the Valar decided to protect\nthe Elves from Melkor by defeating him and imprisoning him, the changing\nof the shape of Middle-earth effected the Iron Mountains as well.\nAfterwards, the mountain range was distorted but was still long with\nlengths stretching from the Helcaraxë in the far northwest to the\nOrocarni in the far east and rising to immense and frighting heights,\nwith enormous peaks such as Thangorodrim.\n\nIn the days of the War of the Jewels, the mountains protected Morgoth\nfrom being outflanked from the rear and with no enemy behind him, he was\nable to concentrate on the south. Because of its perilous heights,\nfrightening looks, and foul winds, no Elf ever passed through the\nmountains for any reason but the spies of Morgoth would always find ways\ninto the Beleriand, by unknown ways through the mountains. Morgoth's\nforces also captured Elves and brought them through the mountains to\nAngband.\n\nAfter the War of Wrath the Iron Mountains and Thangorodrim were\ndestroyed and the vast mountain chain was broken and disappeared for a\ngreat part of their length. North of the range lay the Forodwaith, a\nregion of ever-lasting cold. Remnants of the great mountain range in the\nThird Age included the Mountains of Angmar in northern Eriador, as well\nas the Ered Mithrin and the Iron Hills of northern Rhovanion. The\nIron Mountains remained unchanged after the Change of the World and ever\nafter. The only people known to have lived in the cold climates\nof the Forodwaith were a Mannish people known as the Lossoth, the\ndescendants of the people known as the Forodwaith who once lived in the\narea around the Iron Mountains of the Ice-Bay of Forochel.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe _Iron Mountains_ was known as the 'Ered Engrin' in Sindarin which\nmeant 'Mountains of Iron'."

These were cast down and destroyed by Melkor. Afterward, the\nValar went to Valinor and Yavanna sang into existence the Two Trees,\nsilver Telperion and golden Laurelin. Telperion was considered male and\nLaurelin female. The Trees sat on the hill Ezellohar located outside\nValimar. They grew in the presence of all of the Valar, watered by the\ntears of Nienna.\n\n Each tree was a source of\nlight: Telperion's silver and Laurelin's gold. Telperion had dark leaves\n(silver on one side) and his silvery dew was collected as a source of\nwater and of light. Laurelin had gold-trimmed leaves and her dew was\nlikewise collected by Varda. One “day” lasted twelve hours. Each Tree,\nin turn, would give off light for seven hours (waxing to full brightness\nand then slowly waning again), so that at one hour each of “dawn” and\n“dusk” soft gold and silver light would be given off together.\n\nJealous, Melkor enlisted the help of the giant spider-creature Ungoliant\n(the mother of Shelob) to destroy the Two Trees. Concealed in Unlight,\nMelkor struck each Tree and the insatiable Ungoliant devoured whatever\nlife and light remained in them.\n\nAgain Yavanna sang and Nienna wept, but they succeeded only in reviving\nTelperion's last flower (to become the Moon) and Laurelin's last fruit\n(to become the Sun). These were assigned to lesser spirits, male Tilion\nand female Arien, after the 'genders' of the Trees themselves. This\nis why, in _The Lord of the Rings_, the Sun is usually referred to as\n“she” and the moon as “he”.\n\nHowever, the true light of the Trees, before their poisoning by\nUngoliant, was said to afterwards reside only in the Silmarils.\n\n\nTelperion's descendants\n\nBecause the Elves that first came to Valinor especially loved Telperion,\nYavanna made a second tree like it to stand in the city of Tirion where\nthe Vanyar and Ñoldor dwelt together at first. This tree,\nnamed Galathilion, was identical to Telperion except that it gave no\nlight of its own. It had many seedlings, one of which was planted in the\nisle of Tol Eressëa (named CELEBORN).\n\nIn the Second Age, a seedling of Celeborn was brought as a gift to the\nNúmenóreans - this was Nimloth, the White Tree of Númenor. It lasted\nthrough the majority of the realm's duration, but when Sauron took\ncontrol of the island he commanded King Ar-Pharazôn to chop it down.\n\nFortunately Isildur managed to save a single fruit of that tree. Of this\nfruit later came the White Tree of Gondor.\n\n\nInternal significance\n\nThe Two Trees of Valinor existed at a time when the only other source of\nlight was the stars (which had been created for the Elves' benefit by\nVarda from the dews collected from the Two Trees). When three Elven\nambassadors were brought to see Valinor for themselves, in order that\nthe Elves might be convinced to come to Valinor, it seems that the Two\nTrees affected them most significantly.\n\nIn particular Thingol is said to have been motivated in the Great\nJourney by his desire to see the Light of Valinor again (until he finds\ncontentment in the light he sees in Melian's face). Also in later times,\nthe Elves would be divided between the _CALAQUENDI_ who had seen the\nlight of the Trees, and the _MORIQUENDI_ who hadn't; with the former\ngroup having found enlightenment and near rapture in the light they\nbeheld.\n\nThe Silmarillion repeatedly states that those Elves who saw the Two\nTrees were mighty, with the light of Aman in their faces. As vassals of\nthe Valar, the trees somehow bestowed otherworldy power and\nunderstanding on those who were exposed to them. Galadriel in particular\nhad an affinity to Laurelin, as her hair was said to have captured the\ngolden light of that tree. In turn this inspired Feanor to make the\njewels that could hold that same light; the Silmarils.\n\nThe whole of the history of the First Age is strongly affected by the\ndesire of many different characters to possess the Silmarils, which\ncontain the only remaining unsullied light of the Trees. Yet upon his\nflight from Valinor after destroying the light of the Two Trees, Melkor\nstole the Silmarils and sparked the Oath of Fëanor (who renamed Melkor\nMorgoth) and after many years the Valar embarked on the War of Wrath,\nWhich ended the First Age\n\nIn the Second and Third Ages, the White Trees of Númenor and of Gondor,\nwhose likeness descends from that of Telperion, have a mostly symbolic\nsignificance. They stand both as symbols of the kingdoms in question,\nand also as reminders of the ancestral alliance between the Dúnedain and\nthe Elves. Even in this late age the two trees are remembered by some.\nGandalf obviously remembers them with reverence, as he speaks of them to\nPippin.\n\n\nExternal significance\n\nTolkien, as a Roman Catholic, would have been exposed to the\nsignificance of light in Catholic symbolism. Trees were of special\nimportance to him - in his short story _Leaf by Niggle_, which in a\nsense was an elaborate allegory explaining his own creative process, the\nprotagonist spends his life painting a single Tree.\n\nThe Two Trees represent the recurrent 'gold and silver' concept of the\nlegendarium. They are created after the lamps Ormal and Illuin - and\nfrom the trees themselves, the Sun and Moon are later created.\n\nTolkien may have also gotten inspiration for the trees directly from the\nSun, which rises in the day (as Laurelin, the golden tree), and the moon\nwhich rises in the night (Telperion, the silver tree).\n\n\nEtymology\n\nBoth Telperion and Laurelin are said to have been given many names among\nwhich are the following: Laurelin was also given the names of MALINALDA\nand CULÚRIEN,''' '''while Telperion was also named '''Silpion '''and\nNINQUELÓTË. Telperion's name in Valarin, the language of the Valar, is\nsaid to have been _IBRÎNIÐILPATHÂNEZEL_; Laurelin's name is recorded as\n_TULUKHEDELGORÛS._\n\nIn early writings of Tolkien, Telperion's names were SILPION ,\nBANSIL, and BELTHIL.\n\n\nQuotations\n\n“Yet even as hope failed  Telperion bore at last upon a leafless\nbough one great flower of silver, and Laurelin a single fruit of gold.”\n- _The Silmarillion_\n\n“... and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of Feanor at their\nwork, while both the White Tree and Golden were in flower!” Gandalf to\nPippin, _The Two Towers_\n\n\nNotes\n\n-   Tolkien could have taken the creation of light mentioned in Genesis\n    as inspiration for the two trees, as both brought light into\n    Middle-earth and were turned into the moon and sun.",

    "text": "THE DOOR OF NIGHT (also called MORITARNON or TARN\nFUI) was a place set at the utmost West of Arda near the Void. The Door\nwas created by the Valar at the time of the making of the Sun and Moon.\nIt was vital in the cosmology of Middle-earth, forming the border\nbetween Arda and the void, as well as being the final prison of the\nrenegade Vala Morgoth Bauglir.\n\n\nCreation\n\nThe Door was created by the Valar as a gateway for the Sun to pass\nthrough. According to others, though, it was made expressly as a gateway\nthrough which to expel Morgoth. The following text describes the\ncreation of the Door in the _Ainulindale_:\n\n  _Thus came it that the Gods dared a very great deed, the most mighty\n  of their works; for making a fleet of magic rafts and boats with\n  Ulmo's aid - and otherwise had none of these endured to sail upon the\n  waters of Vai - they drew to the Wall of Things, and there they made\n  the Door of Night._\n\n\nPurpose\n\nThe Sun was to pass through the Door of Night as it travelled above\nArda. When the Sun passed through the Door, night would fall upon\nMiddle-earth. The Moon would then rise from its resting place and\ncontinue on its path over the Earth. The Sun would traverse the border\nof the Wall of the World, re-entering the world in the East, at the\nGates of Morning. At the same time the Moon would be sinking in the West\nand a new day would begin. At the conclusion of the War of Wrath, when\nEärendil the Mariner sailed to Aman to beseech the aid of the Valar,\nMorgoth was imprisoned outside the Door of Night. The following is told\nin _The Silmarillion_:\n\n  _“But Morgoth himself the Valar thrust through the Door of Night\n  beyond the Walls of the World, into the Timeless Void; and a guard is\n  set forever on those walls, and Eärendil keeps watch upon the ramparts\n  of the sky.”_\n\nAt the “End of Days” (which is referenced to even in _The Lord of the\nRings_ by Gandalf, Tom Bombadil, and others), Morgoth shall return as\nMelkor by breaking the Door of Night, precipitating the Last Battle\n(Dagor Dagorath).\n\n\nLocation\n\nA description of the location of the Door of Night is found in _The Book\nof Lost Tales Part One_:\n\n  _About the World are the Ilurambar, or Walls of the World. They are as\n  ice and glass and steel, being above all the imagination of the\n  Children of Earth cold, transparent, and hard. They cannot be seen,\n  nor can they be passed, save by the Door of Night. Within these walls\n  the Earth is globed: above, below and upon all sides is Vaiya, the\n  Enfolding Ocean. But this is more like to sea below the Earth and more\n  like to air above the Earth._\n\n\nAppearance\n\nThe Door of Night was likened to a huge gate of stone at the very edge\nof the world: the _Ilurambar_, invisible Walls of the World.\n\n  _There it still stands, utterly black and huge against the deep-blue\n  walls. Its pillars are of the mightiest basalt and its lintel\n  likewise, but great dragons of black stone are carved thereon, and\n  shadowy smoke pours slowly from their jaws._\n\n\nFate\n\nIn the _Book of Lost Tales Part One_ the fate of the Door of Night in\nthe West, and its counterpart, the Gates of Morning in the East, are\ndocumented as follows:\n\n  _For 'tis said ere the Great end come Melko shall in some wise\n  contrive a quarrel between Moon and Sun, and Ilinsor shall seek to\n  follow Urwendi through the Gates, and when they are gone the Gates of\n  both East and West will be destroyed, and Urwendi and Ilinsor shall be\n  lost._"

When the wind blew\nthrough the branches, the sound of far off seas and the cries of extinct\nsea-birds could be heard. Niphredil and Elanor grew in the grass.\n\n\nHistory\n\nCerin Amroth was the mound of Amroth, where Elanor flowers grew, that\nstood in the heart of Lórien and held the house of that king before he\nwas lost over a thousand years before.\n\nAragorn comes to Cerin Amroth where he meets lady Arwen again giving her\nthe Ring of Barahir and where they both plighted their troth.\n\nAs the Fellowship of the Ring, fresh from Moria, entered into the beauty\nand safety Lothlorian and rest beside the stream Nimrodel, Frodo could\nhear a singing voice mingled with the sound of rippling water. Legolas\nremembered and sang the tragic tale of Amroth and Nimrodel.\n\nWhen Durin's Bane, the Balrog of Moria, was awakened, an evil arose that\nbegan to surround the peaceful forest of Lothlorien. This became too\nmuch for Nimrodel to bare. She and her love, the King of Lothlorien,\nAmroth, began their journey southwards towards the sea and the undying\nlands. Nimrodel became lost in the White Mountains and perished never\nfinding her way to Amroth who waited upon a boat tethered to the shore\nnear Belfalas. A storm arose, driving the boat out to sea. In\ndesperation and love, Amroth lept from the boat to swim to shore, hoping\nto find Nimrodel, yet drowned in the dark stormy waters of the ocean.\nBoth lovers died painfully yearning to find each other. In this way\nsorrow first came to the land of Lorien.\n\nUntil the days of the Fellowship, the singing of Nimrodel could be heard\nin the falls near where she lived. The voice of Amroth can similarly be\nheard when the wind blows into Lorien from the south, where he had\ndrowned. It is in the mingling of the waters of the stream of Nimrodel,\nwith the waters of the Anduin and eventually the ocean, the two lovers\nare symbolically united.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring stopped at Cerin Amroth as they were being\nescorted through Lórien to the Lord and Lady in Caras Galadhon by\nHaldir. Frodo could feel the southern wind blow upon Cerin Amroth,\ncarrying the sounds and sights of the southern ocean.\n\nFrodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee followed Haldir up to the flet built in the\ncenter tree while the others rested in the grass. Frodo saw Caras\nGaladhon from the flet. He could see Anduin the Great and Southern\nMirkwood corrupted by Dol Guldur.\n\nReturning to the grass at the foot of Cerin Amroth, Frodo finds Aragorn\nplaying with an elanor flower, lost in memory. He sees him as if clothed\nin white as a young lord tall and fair, speaking elvish to someone he\ncannot see. Aragorn speaks in Elvish “fair Arwen, fairwell” then looks\ntowards Frodo and smiles.\n\nIt was here where Arwen, after Aragorn's death, went to die, in the\nplace Aragorn had proposed to her, sometime before the spring of FO 121\nand was where her grave was located."

    "text": "BARAD EITHEL also known as EITHEL SIRION was the main fortress and\ncapital of the realm of Fingolfin and Fingon, while it endured.\n\nIt was located in the mountainous eastern foothills of the Ered Wethrin,\nat the source of the River Sirion, just outside Hithlum, some sixty\nmiles from Thangorodrim. It was attacked and besieged many times during\nthe First Age by the forces of Morgoth. When Men came into the service\nof the Ñoldor, it was entrusted to the House of Hador. It survived the\nDagor Bragollach but was conquered and occupied by the enemy after the\nNirnaeth Arnoediad.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBarad Eithel guarded a pass over the Ered Wethrin into Hithlum, the\nrealm of Fingolfin, the High King of the Ñoldor. There were several\nmountain fortresses along the eastern border, but Barad Eithel was\nFingolfin's primary stronghold. Cavalry based at Barad Eithel patrolled\nthe plains of Ard-galen.\n\nDuring the Dagor Bragollach in FA 455, rivers of fire from Angband\nturned the grassy plain of Ard-galen into Anfauglith. The Elves of\nHithlum and their allies the Men of Dor-lómin were driven back to the\nmountain forts.\n\nDuring the Siege of Angband, Barad Eithel lay at the heart of the\nNoldor's defences, and also guarded the passes westward into Hithlum.\nThroughout the siege, Elves of Fingolfin's people would patrol the green\nfields of Ard-galen, holding Morgoth within his fortress at Angband,\nclose by to the north.\n\nThat changed in the Dagor Bragollach, when the plains of Ard-galen were\noverrun with rivers of fire and turned to scorching dust. Armies of Orcs\nassailed Fingolfin's city, but it held firm, though Hador, the Lord of\nDor-lómin and his younger son Gundor were both lost in its defence, in\nfront of the fortress's walls. Looking out across the burning desert in\ndespair, Fingolfin set out from Barad Eithel to challenge Morgoth to\nsingle combat, and was lost. His son Fingon became the High King of the\nÑoldor in his place, and took up his rule from Eithel Sirion.\n\n\n\nThough the Siege of Angband had been broken, Barad Eithel still held,\nand so the passes into Hithlum remained secure. Morgoth resolved to\nbreak this defence, and sent another army seven years after the Dagor\nBragollach to overcome Fingon's forces. Again they were repulsed, but\nGaldor was slain in the attack, where his father Hador had fallen just\nseven years before. Galdor was killed by an arrow. His son Húrin then,\ndrove the enemy forces back from Barad Eithel and pursued them across\nAnfauglith.\n\nWhen the Elves came together for a vast new assault on Morgoth, Barad\nEithel was the staging post for the western armies. It was from there\nthat the soldiers of Fingon swept across the dusty remnant of Ard-galen,\nin the glorious beginning of the battle that would turn to the tragedy\nof the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. Gelmir's brother Gwindor was on the outworks\nof Barad Eithel, and in his anger he launched a premature attack against\nMorgoth's forces. Fingon ordered his troops to follow and advance on\nAngband, but despite their initial success they were ultimately defeated\nin the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Fingon was killed and no Elves returned to\nHithlum, which Morgoth gave to the Easterlings.\n\nThough the fate of Barad Eithel in that battle is polemical described,\nthe fact that Fingon's realm was destroyed and Hithlum occupied must\nmean that the fortress at Eithel Sirion was captured or destroyed. By\nthe last years of the First Age, if Fingolfin's mountain fortress was\nnot in the hands of the Orcs, it would have fallen into ruin and\ndecay.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _BARAD EITHEL_ means “Tower of the Well” in Sindarin from\n_barad_ meaning “tower” and _eithel_ meaning “well, spring”."

The host of Fingolfin, which had been betrayed by\nFëanor in Aman, had managed the near-impossible crossing of the\nHelcaraxë and had arrived in Middle-earth, its members bitter and\nfurious.

    "text": "The DISASTER OF THE GLADDEN FIELDS or the BATTLE OF THE GLADDEN FIELDS\nwas a battle at the beginning of the Third Age, in which Isildur and a\nretinue of the Dúnedain of Arnor, marching home after the defeat of\nSauron, were attacked by a large group of Orcs from the Misty Mountains.\nThe king and his three eldest sons -- Elendur, Aratan, and Ciryon --\nwere slain and the Ring of Power was lost in the River Anduin. Only\nthree men survived the encounter, but the shards of Narsil were saved by\nOhtar, an esquire of the king. \n\nThe repercussions of the attack were wide-ranging, as Isildur had been\nking of both Gondor and Arnor, and his death left the two kingdoms to\nseparate into isolated realms. Arnor wouldn't be able to completely\nrecover from this catastrophic loss of a considerable part of its nobles\nand knights until the kingship of Aragorn II Elessar of the Elendili in\nthe Fourth Age. However, most importantly, Isildur's death prevented him\nfrom passing on the One Ring to the Keepers of the Three, which he had\ndivulged to his son Elendur to be his chief reason for visiting Elrond\nin Rivendell.\n\n\nHistory\n\nPrelude\n\nAfter that War of the Alliance, Isildur remained in Gondor for a year,\nregaining lost territories, and reorganising the realm. He sent the\ngreater part of the armies of Arnor back to Eriador via the Númenórean\nroad from the Fords of Isen to Fornost. After he was done with arranging\nthe affairs of the southern realm, he delivered the South Kingdom to\nMeneldil and forthwith designed to march to Rivendell. He had left his\nwife and youngest son there, yet he also greatly desired the counsel of\nElrond at that time. It was for this reason that he proceeded from\nOsgiliath into the Vale of the Anduin, and over the Cirith Forn en\nAndrath, which was the high-climbing pass of the Northern Misty\nMountains which led down into the valley of Rivendell. \n\nThe Battle\n\nThe Dúnedain host had traveled northwards from Lórien, marching along a\npath that led to Greenwood the Great wherein Thranduil was king. Their\nroute had been diverted by the flooding of the Anduin, which had\ncompelled Isildur to take the road on the sheer slopes on the eastern\nbanks of the river. King Isildur's party was flanked on its left by\nsteep cliffs overlooking the River Anduin, and to its left, by hills and\na forest.\n\nThe Dúnedain were singing marching songs and generally of good cheer as\ndusk drew close, at which time the lusty men heard the strain of orcs in\nthe forest hills. Isildur organised his retinue into a “Thangail,” a\nshield-wall two men deep and flexible at the flanks; it could be made to\nback up completely so as to form a defensive ring should the unit be\nsurrounded. The Dúnedain could only guess at the strength of the enemy,\nbut they perceived that the orc host was many times, perhaps even 10\ntimes as large as their own. Isildur expressed regret that the orcs\nshould have approached them at such uneven ground, for had it been level\nor rather downhill for the Dúnedain, then they should have formed up\ninto a “Dírnaith”, a wedge formation that could have shattered the\nmiscreant orcs. \n\nThe first orc onslaught came quickly, striking at the center of the\nDúnedain line after a volley of arrows had been fired. At this point,\nIsildur sent for his esquire, Ohtar, to take the shards of Narsil to\nRivendell for safekeeping should the battle go ill. The orcs were\ndiscomfited at no cost among the Dúnedain, all of whom towered above the\ntallest of the orcs. Piles of orcs had gathered before the Dúnedain, and\nthe orcs again kept their distance out of range of the powerful\nNúmenórean bows. Isildur judged that the orcs, in their typically craven\nfashion, were so thoroughly dismayed to be stung so badly in the fight\nthat they would not resume battle, but would rather stalk the Dúnedain\nfrom a distance. The king then resolved to bring his retinue onto lower\nand more level ground, yet the host had not marched more than a mile\nbefore the orcs returned again. Hope faded as the orcs crept towards\nthem in silence and under cover of darkness. In this second attack, the\norcs approached in a full crescent, resolving to pressure the Dúnedain\nat all points in their formation. Men were slain, and the formation\nstarted crumbling. Yet the Men of Númenór did their sires honour, for\nmany died at the cost of five orcs each. Ciryon and Aratan were killed,\nand Elendur convinced Isildur to flee and cross the Anduin if he could,\non whose other side he might find safety and make his way to Rivendell. \n\nThe Route of Isildur\n\nIsildur then cloaked himself with the ring, and sped down into the\nvalley. He made a long journey to the banks of the Anduin, and there\nparted with all of his arms and armour save for a short sword. The river\nwas hard to cross, thus, though rarely equaled in strength and vigour\neven by fellow Dúnedain, Isildur was exhausted when he reached the\nwestern shallows. There, reeds and rushes tangled him and the ring\nabandoned him, slipping from his fingers. Orc prowlers then caught sight\nof the large and imposing figure, and out of fear they shot at him and\nfled quickly, having pierced him in throat and heart. \n\nAftermath\n\nOnly Ohtar, and an unnamed companion; and a stunned combatant and\nesquire of Elendur, Estelmo, had survived the disaster. Isildur's body\nwas never recovered by men, and was secretly presumed captured and\nmutilated at Sauron's command. The orc host which had waylaid the\nDúnedain were quickly scattered by a relief force of woodsmen which\nnone-the-less had come too late to affect the fate of the king's\nretinue. The orc victory had been so Pyrrhic that it would take them\nmany years before they would gather the strength to venture out again in\nthe Vales of Anduin. Estelmo was recovered alive, but stunned from a\nclub's blow, and he told of how Isildur and Elendur had related to each\nother about the One Ring before their deaths. Isildur remarked: “I\ncannot use it. I dread the pain of touching it. And I have not yet found\nthe strength to bend it to my will. It needs one greater than I know\nmyself to be. My pride has fallen. It should go to the Keepers of the\nThree.”\n\nThen, probably the biggest consequences of the Gladden Fields was that\nthe union of Arnor and Gondor was broken by blood, but more importantly;\nthat Isildur never managed to give the Ring of Power to Elrond,\nGaladriel and Celeborn. All of them would have most likely decided to\ndestroy it long before Sauron could have gathered his spirit again and\nrefortified Mordor; in effect destroying the Dark Lord in the same way\nhe was extinguished beyond all hope of recovery by Frodo."

    "text": "The FIRST BATTLE OF BELERIAND was the first major battle of the War of\nthe Great Jewels, fought mainly by the Sindar against the forces of the\nDark Lord Morgoth.\n\n\nHistory\n\nWhile the Ñoldor were still struggling in Aman, Morgoth had already\narrived in Middle-earth well ahead of them, and quickly reoccupied his\nold fortress of Angband where his servants Sauron and Gothmog had long\nbeen breeding Orcs in the darkness. Morgoth moved quickly to resume his\ndesire to conquer and dominate the peoples of Middle-earth and sent\nforth his armies hoping to master all the areas south of his domain\nquickly. Morgoth's forces issued forth in two main hosts, passing west\nthrough the vale of Sirion and east between Aros and Gelion, some of\nthem even scaling the passes of Anach and Aglon. Well-armed having\ndefended the Beleriand from the evil and savage things of the north,\nKing Thingol were prepared for war but faced setbacks. The western Orc\nhost ravaged and plundered much in the West Beleriand. Lord Círdan of\nthe Havens of the Falas came out to meet them but was defeated and\nforced to retreat into the walled cities of Eglarest and Brithombar,\nwere they were besieged. Thus, the forces of Thingol were cut-off from\ntheir Elven allies in the west.\n\nDetachments of both Orc hosts entered the domain of Thingol and\nMenegroth, Thingol's forces fought and held them at bay but his main\nfocus was on the bulk of the eastern Orc host fighting his hard-pressed\nally, King Denethor of the Laiquendi. Denethor, who answered Thingol's\ncall for aid attacked the Orcs but he and his people were lightly armed\nand were no match for the arms of their foes. Eventually, he and his\nforces were pushed back onto Amon Ereb where they were cut-off and\nsurrounded. Here, Denethor and his lightly armed company made their last\nstand against a sea of foes and he was slain before Thingol could rescue\nhim. When Thingol's forces arrived, the Orcs stood no chance and were\nutterly defeated. Those Orcs that did escape death scattered east but\nwere slain by the Dwarves of Mount Dolmed. The battle was over and the\narmies of Thingol stood victorious over Morgoth's forces in the East\nBeleriand.\n\nThis was the only battle against the Dark Lord in which the Sindar took\nan active role.\n\nAftermath\n\nThought battle was held to be over, the cities of the Havens remained\nunder siege by the forces of the Western Orc host. After learning of\nthis, Thingol summoned all the Sindar that wished to live in peace to\nthe lands within the forests of Region and Neldoreth. Melian then set\nforth her powers and afterwards the lands of Thingol became a closed\nrealm and was put under protection by the magical barrier _Girdle of\nMelian_, which were ever after known as Doriath. As no aid came from\nThingol, Lord Círdan and his people had to hold out against his\nattackers alone. The Havens were only freed when the Orcs withdrew\nnortheast to fight the Ñoldor under Fëanor.\n\nAfter the death of their king and the heavy losses they took during\nbattle, the Laiquendi returned to the forests of the Ossiriand. There\nthey pledged to live in secrecy forsaking war and distrusting outsiders.\nThey never again named a king. Many Laiquendi went north entering the\nland of Doriath and were forever merged with his people.",

    "text": "The '''Barrow-wights '''were shape-shifting beings of darkness, similar\nin circumstance to Wraiths, who dwelt in dark places of Eriador such as\nthe Barrow-downs.\n\nThe characteristic of shape-shifter gave Barrow-wights the ability to\nreanimate whatever life-form they wished. The ones which attacked the\nfour Hobbits reanimated the corpses of the Kings of the Barrows. Most\noften the Barrow-wight came on the unwary traveller in the guise of a\ndark phantom whose eyes were luminous and cold. The voice of the figure\nwas at once horrible and hypnotic; its skeletal hand had a touch like\nice and a grip like the iron jaws of a trap. Once under the spell, the\nvictim had no will of his own. In this way the Barrow-wights drew the\nliving into the tombs of the downs. A dismal choir of tortured souls\ncould be heard inside the Barrow as, in the green half-light, the\nBarrow-wight laid his victim on a stone altar and bound him in chains of\ngold. He draped him in pale cloth and precious jewelry of the ancient\ndead, and with a sacrificial sword ended them.\n\n\n\nEast of the Brandywine River beyond the Old Forest were the\nBarrow-downs, the most ancient burial ground of men in Middle-earth.\nThere were no trees nor water there, but only grass and turf covering\ndome-shaped hills that were crowned with monoliths and great rings of\nbone-white stone. These hills were the burial mounds that were made in\nthe First Age of the Sun for the Kings of Men. For many ages the\nBarrow-downs were sacred and revered, until out of the Kingdom of Angmar\nmany terrible and tortured spirits fled across Middle-earth, desperately\nsearching to hide from the ravening light of the Sun. Demons whose\nbodies had been destroyed looked for other bodies in which their evil\nspirits could dwell. And so it was that the Barrow-downs became a\nhaunted and terrible place. The demons became Barrow-wights, the Undead\nwho animated the bones and jeweled armor of the ancient Kings of Men who\nhad lived in the First Age of the Sun.\n\n\n\nIn the darkness they were powerful spirits and they could be held at bay\nonly with the spell of strong incantations, such as Tom Bombadil's song.\nHowever, normally they could be destroyed only by exposure to light, the\nentity they hated and feared the most. The Barrow-wights were lost and\ntortured spirits, and their last chance to remain upon Earth depended on\nthe dark security of burial vaults. Once the stone chamber was broken\nopen, light would pour in on the Barrow-wights and they would fade like\nmist before the sun and be gone forever.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Barrow-wights began appearing in the Barrow-downs after the Dúnedain\nof Cardolan succumbed to the ravages of the Great Plague. They were put\nthere by sorcerers of Angmar who corrupted the souls of the inhabitants\nof the Barrow-downs. The sorcerers were sent by the Witch-king of Angmar\nwho wished to keep the Dúnedain away from there.\n\nOn September 28 of 3018 Frodo Baggins and his companions, Sam Gamgee,\nMerry, and Pippin while passing through the Barrow-downs were captured\none by one by the Barrow-wights, and trapped in what was believed to be\nthe cairn of the last prince of Cardolan.\n\nThere they were almost slain by a wight; three of the Hobbits had been\nlain in a barrow filled with a strange green light and were dressed in\nwhite robes and wore jewels and gold and had a sword across their necks.\nThe wight had finished an incantation, and was preparing to finish them\noff when Frodo summoned up the courage to slice off its hand; he then\ncalled upon Tom Bombadil when the wight extinguished the dim light in\nthe cavern. Bombadil performed some kind of exorcism on the barrow,\nthrough the rare power of his singing, which caused the wight to flee\nwith a shriek; he then gave the hobbits swords and then spread out the\ngold and treasures from the barrow on the grass, so that the barrow's\nspell was broken and no Wight could make habitat there.\n\n\n"

They encamped on the northern shore of Lake Mithrim.\n\nMorgoth hoped to destroy the returning Ñoldor before they could\nestablish themselves, and sent his forces through the passes of the Ered\nWethrin. Although the Orcs of Morgoth by far outnumbered the Ñoldor, the\nÑoldor were still empowered with the Light of Valinor, and quickly\ndefeated them. The Orcs retreated north through Ard-galen, with the\nÑoldor in hot pursuit.\n\nThe forces of Morgoth that had been besieging the Havens of the Falas\nsince the First Battle of Beleriand marched north to attack the Ñoldor\nin the rear, but a force led by Celegorm ambushed them at Eithel Sirion.\nTrapped between the two Ñoldorin forces, the Orcs fought for ten days,\nencircled at the Fens of Serech. All but a few Orcs perished in the\nbattle, and Fëanor in his wrath pursued even this small group. But he\ndrew too far ahead of the main host of his people, and seeing this, the\nOrcs turned and gave battle at the edge of Dor Daedeloth. Being\nvirtually at Angband's gates, the Orcs were joined by a number of\nBalrogs, and the Elves were quickly slain. Fëanor stood his ground and\nlong fought alone, until he was fatally wounded by Gothmog. However,\nbefore the Balrogs could kill him, Fëanor was rescued by his sons.\nFëanor would die soon afterwards due to his wounds.\n\nImmediately following this skirmish, the Moon rose, and with its rising\nFingolfin and the second, greater host of the Ñoldor arrived in\nLhammoth. There they were attacked by a force of Orcs which had earlier\nbeen sent there by Morgoth to attack Fëanor in the rear, and they fought\ntheir first battle, the Battle of Lhammoth. The Ñoldor were caught\noff-guard, and Fingolfin's son Argon was slain. Fingolfin and his host\npursued the Orcs until they were completely destroyed, and then passed\ninto Mithrim as the Moon first rose.\n\nThe victory was decisive for the Ñoldor, who had destroyed most of\nMorgoth's forces in one mortal strike, but they had lost their greatest\nwar-leader and one of their greatest princes.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_DAGOR-NUIN-GILIATH_ was Sindarin for 'battle-beneath-stars'.\n\n\nNotes\n\nThe Battle of Lhammoth and Argon do not appear in the published _The\nSilmarillion_ at all, because they only came to light in very late\nwritings by Tolkien. In the published The Silmarillion, Fingolfin's host\nonly arrives after the battle is long over.\n\nIn the second edition of _The Silmarillion_ edited by Christopher\nTolkien, Fingolfin appears during the battle but his son's death is not\nmentioned.",

It was there that Thingol\nwas slain by the Dwarven craftsmen of Nogrod. The quest of Beren to gain\na Silmaril begins at Menegroth. It is also here that Lúthien the fair\nwas born. It was later sacked by the Sons of Fëanor in pursuit of one of\nthe Silmarils taken from Morgoth's Iron Crown prior to the War of Wrath.\n\n\nHistory\n\nYears of the Trees\n\n\n\nIn the years after the War for Sake of the Elves, the Teleri were\nscattered all over Beleriand in havens such as Falas or in the woodlands\nat Region and Neldoreth. Their leader Elwë disappeared for a long time\nin the woods with Melian, his beloved. Then, he and Melian reappeared\ncalling himself Thingol, was urged to build a home for his people, so he\nhad the Dwarves of Belegost to aid in the construction of a new\nfortress. It was dug into the western wall of the ravine above the river\nEsgalduin and had only one entrance high above the river accessible by a\nlarge stone bridge. It was named Menegroth or the Thousand Caves because\nof the extensive number of caverns and chambers within all hewn of stone\nand beautifully decorated with carvings of beech trees and birds. These\nwere many different places including armories, treasures, smithies, and\nliving quarters for both the Elves and Dwarves.\n\nDuring the Years of the Trees, Doriath received peace for a long while\nas Thingol preferred isolation and ordered his people not to mingle in\nthe affairs of the Noldor due to the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and the\nQuenyan language was forbidden in his realm. Only with his kin in\nNargothrond did Thingol remain in contact with. He did not take part in\nany of the later Battles of Beleriand relating to the struggle with\nMorgoth.\n\nSometime during mid First Age, Beren Erchamion asked Thingol's\ndaughter, Lúthien, for her hand in marriage, but the King demanded that\nBeren was to go on a quest to retrieve a Silmaril from Morgoth's Iron\nCrown. Lúthien accompanied him on the quest to Angband and they\nsucceeded in eventually retrieving the jewel; but the stakes were high.\nCarcharoth, a wolf guarding the Gates of Angband, bit off Beren's hand\nin which he was holding the Silmaril. The wolf ventured to Menegroth,\nravaging the lands in his path, and broke through its boundaries. He was\nconfronted by the brave Huan, the Great Hound of Valinor, on the\nnorth-east banks of Esgalduin and was killed in the brawl. The Silmaril\nwas found in the wolf's stomach, after swallowing it in Beren's hand,\nand was given to King Thingol.\n\nSack of Doriath\n\nYears later, Hurin Thalion brought the famed Nauglamir as a gift to\nThingol. Thingol contemplated a plan to set the Silmaril into the\nNauglamir. He offered a reward to the Dwarven craftsmen of Nogrod if\nthey succeeded in setting the stone into the Nauglamir. A great desire\nfor the Silmaril possessed the Dwarves and they formed a greed to own\nboth the jewel and the Nauglamir. They finished the work and\nsubsequently claimed the treasure for themselves, slew Thingol, and fled\nMenegroth. \n\nThe news spread fast and the Dwarves were hunted for and then slain. Two\nescaped and and told a tale of lies about their ''betrayal ''and their\nbrethren being _slaughtered_ by the Elves._ _The Dwarves of Nogrod\nformed a great army and rose in anger at the elves and invaded the now\nunguarded Doriath._ _This led to the Battle of the Thousand Caves_ _in\nwhich many were slain on both sides.

A single\nrune is a _certh_.\n\nMany letters have shapes also found in the historical Futhark runes\n(used in _The Hobbit_), but their sound values are only similar in a few\nof the vowels. Rather, the system of assignment of sound values is much\nmore systematic in the Cirth than in the historical runes (e.g., voiced\nvariants of a voiceless sound are expressed by an additional stroke). A\nsimilar system has been proposed for a few historical runes (e.g. _p_ ᛈ\nand _w_ ᚹ as variants of _b_ ᛒ), but is in any case much more obscure.\n\nThe Cirth are not part of the Unicode Standard. However the ConScript\nUnicode Registry has defined the U+E080–E0FF range of the Unicode\n“Private Use Area” for Cirth."

They were counted amongst the Edain.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Drúedain developed a close relationship with the Folk of Haleth, the\nEdain that inhabited that forest region. The Drúedain lived among the\nSecond House of Men, the Haladin, in the First Age in the forest of\nBrethil. There were also a number of the Drúedain present in Númenor,\nthough they had left or died out before the Akallabêth, as had the\nPúkel-men of Dunharrow. At the end of the Third Age, the Drûg still\nlived in the Drúadan Forest of the White Mountains, and on the long cape\nof Andrast west of Gondor. The region north of Andrast was still known\nas Drúwaith Iaur, or “Old Drûg land”.\n\nThe Woses of Ghân-buri-Ghân held off Orcs with poisoned arrows and were\nvital in securing the aid of the Rohirrim in the Battle of the Pelennor\nFields. After the War of the Ring, King Aragorn II Elessar granted the\nDrúadan Forest “forever” to them in the Fourth Age, promising that no\nman would enter their forests without the leave of the Drúedain.\n\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\n\n\nThey were an alien folk to the other Men: a bit like Dwarves in stature\nand endurance, stumpy, clumsy-limbed (with short, thick legs, and fat,\n“gnarled” arms), had broad chests, fat bellies, and heavy buttocks.\nAccording to the Elves and other Men, they had “unlovely faces”: wide,\nflat, and expressionless with deep-set black eyes that glowed red when\nangered. They had “horny” brows, flat noses, wide mouths, and sparse,\nlanky hair. They had no hair lower than the eyebrows, except for a few\nmen who had a tail of black hair on the chin. They were short lived and\nhad a deep hatred of Orcs. Their characteristics may have originated in\nthe First Age. People who didn't know them very well may have thought\nthat Morgoth may have captured some men as they did with the elves and\nbred Orcs from their stock leading to the conclusion that the Drúedain\ncould have possibly been Men that escaped, but were more deformed but\nnot very Orc-like. Evidence for this is that both they and Orcs consider\neach other renegades. They were known to have certain magical powers and\nto be still in meditation for long periods of time.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nOther names\n\n-   DRÛG/DRUGHU: (singular and plural) is the name the Drúedain give to\n    themselves in their own language and the name used for a race known\n    to the Elves as the Drúedain, and to Men.\n-   DRÚATH: (plural) was an earlier Sindarin name for them in ancient\n    times.\n-   RÓG/RÓGIN: (singular and plural) is the name that the Rohirrim have\n    for them in their own language.\n-   RÚ/RÚATANI: (singular and plural) is their name in Quenya.\n-   WOSE/WOSES: (singular and plural) was a word Tolkien took from an\n    Old English word, which was meant to be a translation of the\n    Rohhirric 'Róg'.\n-   OGHOR-HAI: (singular and plural) is the name the Orcs gave to\n    them.\n\nOrigin\n\nTolkien got this term from the legendary Woodwoses of European myths.",

    "text": "The NORTHMEN, also known as the FREE MEN OF THE NORTH,''' '''were Men\nthat lived in the north of Rhovanion in Middle-earth, and were friendly\nto Gondor.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nThe Northmen who dwelt in the Greenwood and other parts of Rhovanion\nwere friendly to the Dúnedain and were, after the Dúnedain, some of the\nmost noble Men in Arda. They were known as Middle Men by the Dúnedain,\nand were believed to have been descended from the same group of Men as\nthe Edain, the Atanatári. The only difference was that they didn't cross\nthe Blue Mountains into Beleriand, and therefore did not journey to\nNúmenor. The result of them not participating in the War against Morgoth\nwas their considerably shorter lifespan; the lifespan of the Dúnedain\nbeing lengthened by the Valar after the War of Wrath. They were\nimportant allies of Gondor and served as a buffer against the\nEasterlings and other foes. For a time many of them even became subjects\nof Gondor, as the realm extended beyond the river Anduin.\n\nEast of Greenwood the Great was the kingdom of Rhovanion, and this\nbecame the most important nation of the Northmen. In the fourteenth\ncentury of the Third Age, King Rómendacil II of Gondor sent his son\nValacar as an ambassador to Vidugavia, the so-called “King of\nRhovanion”. Valacar loved Rhovanion and the daughter of the King,\nVidumavi. He married her and she bore him a son whom she called\n_Vinitharya_ in her mother tongue. In Gondor, Vinitharya became known as\nKing Eldacar and caused a civil war- the Kin-strife- because of his\nmixed Dúnedain/Northmen blood.\n\nShortly after the death of Vidugavia, a small group of Northmen moved to\nthe vales of the Anduin between the Gladden Fields and the Mirkwood,\nprobably to flee from the Wainriders, who had enslaved much of the\npeople of Rhovanion. After the evil Kingdom of Angmar was defeated by\nGondor and the remains of Arnor in TA 1977, these Northmen moved north\nand began to call themselves the Éothéod. They were skilled horse\nbreeders and horsemen. In TA 2510 they responded to a plea of help from\nthe trapped Gondor army at the Field of Celebrant. After they helped\nGondor win this important victory, they were rewarded the province of\nCalenardhon and became known as the Rohirrim. The Men of Rohan who\nfought on foot were called 'Yeomen'.\n\nThe Men of Dale and Lake-town were also counted under the Northmen, as\nwere the woodsmen of Mirkwood. Most of Rhovanion had been depopulated\nafter the wars of the Easterlings and the Great Plague. Their range was\nextremely wide; the Men of the North ranged to the western eaves of\nMirkwood to the southern slopes of the Grey Mountains and from the Long\nLake to Dorwinion on the Sea of Rhun.\n\nIn ''the Hobbit, ''these men carved out a potentially precarious living\nin the eaves of Mirkwood, living as hunters, loggers, trappers, and\nfishermen on the Anduin and its tributaries. They also lived in constant\nfear of attack from Dol Guldur.\n\n\nMilitary\n\nThe larger, more established kingdoms of the North (such as Dale and\nLaketown) would have at least some semblance of a regular standing army.\nThese would have mostly consisted of a force of dismounted men-at-arms,\narmed with a sword and a wooden shield. The Men of the North might have\nreceived some help from Gondor in metalworking, along with their Dwarven\nallies nearby. A militia or town guard would have also been used\nextensively, for the majority of the humans in the north were farmers\nand thus needed their full attention kept on the all-important harvest.\n\nFurther up the military hierarchy would be a force of axemen, for many\nof the woodcutters and loggers in Mirkwood would have learned to use the\naxe from adolescence.\n\nA force of mounted knights and light cavalry would probably have been\navailable for scouting and other duties, for the terrain from Dale to\nDorwinion is mostly flat and featureless, except for a few trees,\nshrubs, and ponds scattered randomly.\n\nBy contrast, the rural, less established kingdom of Rohan trains almost\nevery legitimate soldier it has to fight from horseback, while the\ninfantry division is left to be composed of not soldiers but, as Gamling\nstates in The Two Towers, “every villager able to wield a sword”.\n\n\nLanguages\n\nBeing human means that the Northmen spoke the Common Speech. However,\nthey also have native languages. For example, the Rohirrim spoke\nRohirric, for which Tolkien appears to have been inspired by Old\nEnglish, seeing names like “Éowyn” and “Thengel”. Whereas the Bardings\nand Wood-men speak a similar language to the men of Rohan in terms of\ngross language group, as seen in Old Norse names (akin to Old English\nand Norse being in the same language group), i.e. the name “Brand”\ntranslating to “torch”. The language was not similar to Dwarvish; rather\nthe Dwarf names appearing in _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_\nare Dwarf names given in the language of the Men of Dale, not the native\nDwarf language.  They never shared languages with the Elves or with\ntheir Western, Southern, and Eastern counterparts; other than Westron.\n\nde:Nordmenschen it:Uomini del Nord ru:Северяне"

Círdan was the Lord of the Havens of the Falas, the lands\naround the two rivers Brithon and Nenning next to the sea. The Forest of\nBrethil was settled in by the Men of the Haladin, who guarded it and\nDoriath from all enemies. The gap between the Ered Wethrin and the\nEchoriath was looked after by Orodreth, a relative of Finrod at the\nFortress of Tol Sirion until it was conquered by Sauron.

The\nMannish language was used in Brethil by the men who lived there.

The Valar learnt Quenya instead to converse with the\nElves or with each other if Elves were present.\n\nIt was not just the Elves who borrowed from Valarin.

As Ainur, both Melkor and\nSauron would have spoken Valarin.\n\nValarin bears no relation to any of the other Languages of Middle-earth\nas it arose beyond Arda. Little is known of it, save a few words (mainly\nproper names) although it seems that Valarin used lengthy constructions.\nThe Valarin word for Telperion is, for example, Ibrîniðilpathânezel,\nwhich is eight syllables long.\n\nThe only language before Valarin was the Music of the Ainur, the purest\nform of language as it was thought itself with a self-sufficient\nstructure.

Their first independent King was Meneldil, the nephew\nof Isildur, whose line ruled over Gondor for more than two thousand\nyears. Unlike their cousins in the North, the Dúnedain of the South\nmaintained their realm even after the loss of its Kings, and it survived\nunder the rule of the Stewards until the time of the War of the Ring,\nwhen the Kingship was restored.\n\n\nDescription and Historical accounts\n\nBeing mostly of Númenórean stock and ruled by exiled Númenórean\noverlords, the Men of Gondor continued most of the customs and\ntraditions of Númenór. However, over the centuries, they mixed more and\nmore with the men of Middle-earth. One of these peoples was the Northmen\nwho lived in Rhovanion, and Gondor, ever needing allies, began\nacquainting themselves with these men by the mid Third Age. Brave and\nvaliant, but by the standards of the Dúnedain shorter lived, the\nNorthmen gradually had more and more to do with Gondor, and one of its\nheirs to the throne, Valacar, who lived and worked with them in their\nown land as an ambassador, married one of their noble ladies, setting\nthe stages for the Kin-strife. \n\nOver the next few hundred years afterward, war, rebellion, and plague\nseverally weakened the blood of the Dúnedain in Gondor. Their rulers\nthough survived and retained many of the ancient customs. As the\ncenturies rolled on into the late Third Age, the Men of Gondor\naccustomed to war and invasion became a hardy and stern people more\nlikened to Middle-earth. They became summed up in the phrase, “when\nheads are at a loss, bodies must serve.”\n\nBy the time of just before War of the Ring, the Men of Gondor grappled\nconstantly with the forces of Mordor giving and regaining ground to the\nDark Lord's armies. Their leader Denethor II could foresee nothing but a\nvictory in single combat on the battlefield against him or total doom,\nso when it became clear that Sauron's lost Ring of Power had been found,\nhe and people like his son and others wanted the Ring to be taken by\nGondor and be used against the enemy as a weapon. The Men of Gondor were\nspared the folly of this choice when Denethor's youngest son Faramir let\nFrodo and Sam continue to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring.\n\nAfter the war was won and Aragorn II Elessar was crowned, the Men of\nGondor were rekindled with the ancient tradition of the Dúnedain of old\nwhen Elendil founded the Two Kingdoms with his two sons: Isildur and\nAnárion. They thrived and prospered as part of the Reunited Kingdom into\nFourth Age and beyond.\n\n\nNotable Men of Gondor\n\nImage:Seanbean boromir.jpg|Boromir Image:Faramir3.jpg|Faramir\nImage:Denethor.jpg|Denethor II",

The North Army counter-attacked, and\nwas driven into the _Wold_, cut off from the later reinforcements by the\nBalchoth host. By the time the South Army appeared, the North Army had\ncome under attack by an orcs band which by chance or design had\ndescended from the mountains, and the Dúnedain were backed against the\nriver in a hopeless situation.\n\nAt this time the Éothéod under their leader Eorl the Young suddenly\nappeared, unexpected by friend or foe. The Éothéod crossed the Anduin at\nthe _Undeeps_ of the river, and broke on the rearguard of the Balchoth.\nThe Balchoth were completely defeated and the Gondorian armies saved.\nThe Éothéod continued their foray into northern Gondor, scattering and\ndestroying all the Balchoth in Calenardhon.\n\nAfter the Battle the Steward of Gondor Cirion gave the Éothéod the\nentire land of Calenardhon to dwell in as thanks.

Before that time, Sauron\nhad been secretly living in the stronghold Dol Guldur in Mirkwood, and\nfrom there he had directed numerous attacks against Gondor and Arnor. In\n2060, Gandalf and others of the Wise began to suspect that the evil\npresence in Dol Guldur was Sauron. Gandalf went to Dol Guldur to\ninvestigate in 2063 and Sauron fled into the East, around Rhûn.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the Watchful Peace, Gondor was free from attacks by Sauron's\nminions so it strengthened its borders while keeping a watchful eye on\nthe east, as Minas Morgul - where the Nazgûl nevertheless remained quiet\n- was still a threat on their flank and Mordor was still occupied\nby Orcs. The Dúnedain of the North also had peace for a time.\n\nOver the course of four centuries, Gondor's defenses began to relax. The\nforts along the Anduin guarding Gondor's eastern front were neglected.\nIn the west, garrisons were no longer maintained at Isengard and\nthe Glittering Caves - two strongholds guarding the gap between the\nMisty Mountains and the White Mountains.\n\nIn the north, Arnor had been conquered long before, but the Hobbits of\nthe Shire prospered, getting their first Took Thain and colonizing\nBuckland.\n\nSauron, however, was not idle in the east: he created a strong alliance\nbetween the various tribes of Easterlings, so that when he returned he\nwas more powerful than before and had many Men in his service. Sauron\nreturned to Dol Guldur in TA 2460 and the Watchful Peace ended. Evil\ncreatures had already begun to trouble the north, while attacks on\nGondor resumed soon afterwards. In TA 2475, Ithilien was invaded by\nUruks from Mordor. Around 2480, Orcs repopulated Moria and other\nstrongholds in the Misty Mountains. In 2510, Men from Rhûn called the\nBalchoth, successors to the Wainriders, took advantage of the lightly\nguarded forts along the Anduin and crossed the river en masse. Only the\ncoming of the Éothéod led by Eorl helped Gondor defeat the Balchoth in\nthe Battle of the Field of Celebrant.\n\nDespite that victory, Gondor remained under constant threat from the end\nof the Watchful Peace to the time Sauron and Mordor were finally\noverthrown, in the year 3019."

The Aelin-uial was under\nthe total control of the Sindarin kingdom of Doriath. The march wardens\nof Thingol had secret ferries among the reeds, so that they could cross\nbetween the Sirion's eastern and western banks unseen. At the southern\nend of the Aelin-Uial, the Sirion's waters collected together once more\nfrom the many paths they took through the Marshland and, at the place\ncalled the Falls of Sirion, fell a very loud waterfall down into the\nearth.\n\nIt was here that Turgon and Finrod were given the idea of building their\nhidden fortress at Gondolin and Nargothrond. This idea was given to them\nby Ulmo, who put this idea into their heads while they were dreaming.\n\nAs Beren Erchamion left Doriath, he passed through Aelin-uial and\nproceeded to the Falls of Sirion.\n\nIn search for Túrin Turambar, Morwen and Nienor followed Mablung, who\nlater brought them to the hidden ferries of the elves.

    "page_id": "2983",
    "text": "A FAIRY TALE is a story featuring folkloric characters such as fairies,\ngoblins, elves, trolls, giants, and others. The fairy tale is a\nsub-class of the folktale. These stories often involve princes and\nprincesses, and modern versions usually have a happy ending. In cultures\nwhere demons and witches are perceived as real, fairy tales may merge\ninto legendary narratives, where the context is perceived by teller and\nhearers as having historical actuality. However unlike legends and epics\nthey usually do not contain more than superficial references to religion\nand actual places, persons, and events. Although these allusions are\noften critical in understanding the origins of these fanciful stories.\n\nMany people, including Angela Carter in her introduction to the _Virago\nBook of Fairy Tales_ have noted that a great deal of so-called fairy\ntales do not feature fairies at all. This is partly because of the\nhistory of the English term “fairy tale” which derives from the French\nphrase _contes de fée_ which was first used in the collection of Madame\nD'Aulnoy in 1697. As Stith Thompson and Carter herself point out,\ntalking animals and the presence of magic seem to be more common to the\nfairy tale than fairies themselves.   \n\nSome folklorists prefer to use the German term _Märchen_ to refer to\nfairy tales, a practice given weight by the definition of Stith Thompson\nin his 1977 edition of _The Folktale_: “a tale of some length involving\na succession of motifs or episodes. It moves in an unreal world without\ndefinite locality or definite creatures and is filled with the\nmarvelous. In this never-never land humble heroes kill adversaries,\nsucceed to kingdoms and marry princesses.” (Thompson: 8)\n\n\nHistory\n\nAlthough in the late nineteenth and twentieth century the fairy tale\ncame to be associated with children's literature, adults were originally\nas likely as children to be the audience of the fairy tale. The fairy\ntale was part of an oral tradition: tales were narrated orally, rather\nthan written down, and handed down from generation to generation. The\ntales often had sad endings; such was the penalty for dealing with the\nfairy folk.\n\nLater fairy tales were about princes and princesses, combat, adventure,\nsociety, and romance. Fairies had a secondary role. Moral lessons and\nhappy endings were more common, and the villain was usually punished. In\nthe modern era, fairy tales were altered, usually with violence removed,\nso they could be read to children (who according to a common modern\nsentiment should not hear about violence).\n\nSometimes fairy tales are simply miraculous entertainments, but often\nthey are disguised morality tales. This is true for the Brothers Grimm\n_Kinder- und Hausmärchen_, and much of the drily witty, dead-pan, social\ncriticism beneath the surface of Hans Christian Andersen's tales, which\ninfluenced Roald Dahl.\n\nThe fairy tale has ancient roots, older than the “Arabian Nights”\ncollection of magical tales, in antiquity: Cupid and Psyche, Bel and the\nDragon. Fairy tales resurfaced in literature in the 17th century, with\nthe Neapolitan tales of Giambattista Basile and the later _Contes_ of\nCharles Perrault, who fixed the forms of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.\n\nAn extensive collection of European fairy tales were published by Andrew\nLang in a series of books: _The Red Fairy Book_, _The Orange Fairy\nBook_, and so forth. These provide some excellent examples of the genre.\n\nAccording to a 2004 poll of 1,200 children by UCI Cinemas, the most\npopular fairy tales (in the USA?) are:\n\n1.  Cinderella\n2.  Sleeping Beauty\n3.  Hansel and Gretel\n4.  Rapunzel\n5.  Little Red Riding Hood\n6.  Town Musicians\n\nIn addition, the _Arabian Nights_ stories like _Aladdin and his\nWonderful Lamp_ and _wikipedia:Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves_ are often\nthought to be fairy tales themselves.\n\n\nContemporary fairy tales\n\nIn contemporary literature, many authors have used the form of fairy\ntales for various reasons, such as examining the human condition from\nthe simple framework a fairytale provides. Some authors seek to recreate\na sense of the fantastic in a contemporary discourse. Sometimes,\nespecially in children's literature, fairy tales are retold with a twist\nsimply for comic effect, such as _The Stinky Cheese Man_ by Jon\nScieszka. Other authors may have specific motives, such as multicultural\nor feminist reevaluations of predominantly Eurocentric masculine\ndominated fairy tales, implying critique of older narratives. The figure\nof the damsel in distress has been particularly attacked by many\nfeminist critics. Examples of narrative reversal rejecting this figure\ninclude _The Paperbag Princess_, by Robert Munsch, a picture book aimed\nat children in which a princess rescues a prince, or Angela Carter’s\n_The Bloody Chamber_, which retells a number of fairytales from a female\npoint of view.\n\nOther notable figures who have employed fairy tales include A. S. Byatt,\nJane Yolen, Donald Barthelme, Robert Coover, Margaret Atwood, Tanith\nLee, James Thurber, Kelly Link, John Bly and many others.\n\n    _Fairy tales are more than true -_\n    _not because they tell us dragons exist,_\n    _but because they tell us dragons can be beaten._\n\n&nbsp;\n\n    'G.

    "text": "The STOORS are one of the three races of Hobbits, they mostly inhabited\nswampy areas.\n\nIn their earliest recorded history the Stoors, like the other Hobbits,\nlived in the Vales of Anduin. They were a riverside people that dwelt in\nthe Gladden Fields, and were fishermen.\n\nOne of the most infamous Stoors was Smeagol, who would later become a\ncreature known as the Gollum.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nThey were heavier and broader in build than the other Hobbits, and had\nlarge hands and feet. Among the Hobbits, the Stoors most resembled Men\nand were most friendly to them. Stoors were the only Hobbits who\nnormally grew facial hair.\n\nA habit which set them apart from the Harfoots who lived in the mountain\nfoothills, and the Fallohides who lived in forests far to the north, was\nthat Stoors preferred flat lands and riversides. Only Stoors used boats,\nfished, and could swim. They also wore boots in muddy weather.\n\nStoorish characteristics and appearances remained amongst the Hobbits of\nthe Eastfarthing, Buckland (such as the Brandybucks) and the\nBree-hobbits\n\nThe Stoors also had their own dialect of Hobbitish, owing to the fact\nthat they spent some time in Dunland and adopted many strange words and\nnames which they took to the Shire, and retained even until the late\nThird Age.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Stoors are believed to live in the southern vales of Anduin. During\nthe Hobbit Wandering Days, after the Harfoots had migrated westward in\nThird Age 1050, and the Fallohides followed them about a century later,\nthe Stoors long remained back in the vale of Anduin, but between T.A.\n1150 and 1300 they, too migrated west.\n\nUnlike the other Hobbit-kinds they took the Redhorn Pass and followed a\nsouthern route, where many Stoors branched off and moved south to the\nAngle of Eriador, south of Rivendell and mingled with the Harfoots and\nFallohides that lived there; but most went to Dunland (Swanfleet near\nTharbad) which most resembled their old lands. There they came into\ncontact with the Dunlendings. This contact altered their speech\nslightly, mostly by picking up a few Dunlending words.\n\nA hundred years later Angmar began to threaten Eriador and many Stoors\nof the Angle fled south to their kin in Dunland where they became a\nwoodland people; others returned to Rhovanion and settled the Gladden\nFields, becoming riverland people Déagol and Sméagol belonged to (c.\nT.A. 2430). There they had a matriarchal society. What became of\nthose Stoors and whether they rejoined their folk in Eriador, no history\ntells.\n\nThe Stoors of Dunland moved back north to join the other Hobbits in\ncolonizing the Shire about T.A. 1630 and settled mostly in the\nEastfarthing and Southfarthing. The result was that places that were\nsettled by Stoors have some slight linguistic oddities due to their time\nof separation and contact with the Dunlendings. The three original\nHobbit-kinds merged and blended in the centuries since the settlement of\nthe Shire, but regional variations remained.\n\nSome of these villages might have survived until the War of the Ring,\nwhen they were sought out by the Ringwraiths.\n\nHowever, most Stoors fled to the north and west, ending up in the newly\nfounded Shire around 1630. There they mingled with the Harfoots and\nFallohides, becoming the Shire-folk however they predominantly stayed in\nEastfarthing and then migrated to Buckland.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nStoor is supposed to be a special Hobbitish word that did not exist in\nWestron during the War of the Ring.\n\nEarly English stor, stoor means “large, strong”, referring to the fact\nthat these Hobbits were of heavier build"

After Númenór was consequently destroyed, those\nKing's Men who remained were known as Black Númenóreans, hostile to\nGondor.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThough the King's Men had enjoyed generations of favor from the Kings of\nNúmenor, and no doubt helped in oppressing the Faithful as the Kings\ngrew more suspicious of them, eventually a supporter of the Faithful\ntook the Sceptre once again. This King's name was Tar-Palantir. He\nwished to return Númenor to a state of friendship with the West, but the\nmajority of the Númenóreans still clung to the policies of the King's\nMen. Tar-Palantir's younger brother, Gimilkhâd, sided with his\nrebellious fathers, however. He took up the leadership of the King's Men\nand stood in opposition to his brother, but generally kept his doings\nsecret.\n\nIt was probably to a few lords of the King's Men that Sauron came to\ndeliver some of the Nine Rings of Power, for three of the Nazgûl were\nsaid to be “lords of Númenórean race”. Most of the King's Men living in\nMiddle-earth Sauron and his servants assailed, however. Eventually, the\nlast King of Númenor, Ar-Pharazôn the son of Gimilkhâd, resolved to\ndefeat Sauron in retaliation for this aggression, and he and his men\nsailed to Middle-earth and captured the Maia.\n\nOnce in Númenor, Sauron completed the corruption of the King's Men with\nease, inciting them to worship Melkor and use the few Faithful still\nliving in the land as sacrifices. They also brutally oppressed the Men\nof Middle-earth during this period. The corrupting power of Sauron\naffected their minds deeply, so that they became “quick to anger”, and\nhated all those in the land more fortunate than them. Nor did they\nescape death, for all sorts of sicknesses and mental afflictions\nassailed them, to the point that they “cursed themselves in their\nagony”. When the Valar sent messages of warning in the form of\neagle-shaped clouds to them, they fell upon their faces in great fear,\nand some repented of their actions for a while. In the end, however,\nSauron's mastery over them was so complete that he could walk about the\nland “setting man against man”, and cause them to slay each other. At\nlast, when Ar-Pharazôn had grown old and was in great fear of death,\nSauron persuaded him to take a great army to Aman and challenge the\nValar for immortality. When he did this, his army foundered in the Sea\nand Númenor was also destroyed. Most of the King's Men thus perished\nin the destruction of Ar-Pharazôn's fleet and the Downfall of Númenor,\nbut those who had taken up residence in Middle-earth survived. When\nSauron returned to Mordor, they entered into his service once again, and\nbecame known as the Black Númenóreans.\n\n\nAfter the Downfall\n\n  For many centuries after\nthe Downfall, these descendants of the King's Men held onto the Haven of\nUmbar, the most northerly and famous of their realms.\n\nWhen the surviving Faithful Numenoreans founded Gondor and Arnor, they\nsaw their southern counterparts as renegades, calling them the Black\nNúmenóreans. The Black Númenóreans held a similar hatred of Arnor and\nGondor for generations.\n\nTwo early Black Númenórean lords from the late Second Age were Herumor\nand Fuinur who desired power over men of other, lesser races, and they\n“rose to (great) power amongst the Haradrim”, the peoples neighbouring\nUmbar. They likely shared Sauron's defeat at the hands of the Last\nAlliance of Elves and Men.\n\nThe triumph of the Last Alliance marked the decline of the Black\nNúmenórean race and the end of their racial superiority. They dwindled\nswiftly or became merged with the Middle Men.\n\nQueen Berúthiel, wife of Gondor's King Tarannon Falastur was “a black\nNúmenórean”. This was a loveless union, and was presumably a\npolitical accommodation: that such arrangements were possible implies\nthe existence at that time of more Gondor-friendly Black Númenóreans\nthan the much later Mouth of Sauron.  A\nBlack Númenórean elite survived at least in Umbar for over a thousand\nyears after Númenor's fall, maintaining much influence in Haradwaith. As\nlate as Third Age 1015, for example, even after being exiled from their\nhomeland for nearly a century, the lords that had been driven from Umbar\nled the Haradrim to retake Umbar.\n\nNot much is known about the Black Númenóreans after their defeat by\nCiryaher in T.A. 1050. A “Renegade”, The Mouth of Sauron, had entered\nthe service of Sauron in Mordor. He mocked the army of King Elessar in\nfront of the Morannon.\n\nBlack Numenorean by Jan Pospisil.png Imgres-3.jpeg Ten Cats of Queen\nBeruthiel by Steamey.jpg Black Númenóreans doing a ritual.JPG The Mouth\nof Sauron.jpg The Lord of the Rings War in the North - Men of Carn\nDûm.jpg\n\n\nPolicies\n\nBecause the Shadow lay heavy upon their hearts, the King's Men greatly\nfeared Death and “sought to delay it by all means that they could”.\nThese attempts to escape their fate actually brought death upon them\nsooner, and the lifespans of their Kings waned. They filled the land of\nNúmenor with great tombs to preserve the memory of their dead. In the\nmeantime, their everyday lives became ever more decadent: to ease their\nfears, they “drank and they feasted and they clad themselves in silver\nand gold”."

    "text": "The BLACK GATE, or “MORANNON”, was the gate of Udûn in\nnorthwestern Mordor, and the most fortified and direct entrance into the\nland of Mordor.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nThe Black Gate was set in an impregnable black stone and iron wall that\nstretched from the Mountains of Ash in the north to the Ephel Duath in\nthe west. The wall has been estimated to be 60 feet high and 250 feet\nlong, with each half of the great gate being 90 feet wide, and set on\nlarge stone wheels. Behind the gate were gigantic circular stone\nramparts, and when the gate needed to be opened, two pairs of\nMountain-trolls who were tethered to gigantic beams pushed their way\naround their rampart's track, gradually levering open the gate and\nallowing for the incoming or outgoing of Mordor's armies.\n\nInset within the wall were myriads of archers, spearmen, bowmen, and\nhundreds of thousands of Orc troops ready to defend Mordor. The Gates\nthemselves may have been made of the same indomitable stone that\nconstitutes Orthanc, so hard that even the Ents could not dent it.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIt was originally a gate built by Sauron the Dark Lord of Mordor in the\nSecond Age, to protect and guard the northern entrance into Mordor and\nto prevent invasion at the gap between the Ash Mountains and the Ephel\nDúath. It was probably built with the help of the power of the One Ring,\nlike the Barad-dûr. After Sauron's fall after the Battle of Dagorlad, it\nbecame a garrison of the Men of Gondor. In Gondor's early days, when it\nwas building towers and cities such as Minas Ithil and Cirith Ungol\nclose to Mordor's border, it raised the two great Towers of the Teeth,\nNarchost and Carchost, which were built on either side of the wall and\nwere tall enough to overlook it.\n\nIt was backed up on the other side by the Isenmouthe, and protected by\nthe castle of Durthang to the west; it was redesigned to prevent\nanything evil from entering or leaving Mordor, shielding the outside\nfrom it - and it from the outside. The reconstruction of Minas Ithil,\nTower of the Rising Moon, as well as the construction of Cirith Ungol\nwas also done for the same purpose.\n\n\n\nHowever, they eventually failed and they were taken over by the servants\nof Sauron. Once taken by the Enemy, they became a monument of dread,\nfear, evil, and awe by anyone who saw the gate. Thus the Ringwraiths and\nOrcs re-entered Mordor, eventually overrunning the garrisons and\ninhabiting and taking them for their own uses. It was at this time that\nthe Nazgûl took the tower of Minas Ithil, having its name changed to\n_Minas Morgul_.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Frodo and Sam had a chance to go through the\nBlack Gate when they arrived at Mordor, but it was so heavily fortified\nand guarded by the forces of Mordor that they turned away and were led\non a different route into Mordor by Sméagol. They also saw an army of\nEasterlings enter the gate.\n\nThe Black Gate was the site of the last valiant battle of the War of the\nRing, in the East. In March 3019, the Army of the West commanded by\nAragorn Elessar and numbering some 6,000 men (plus one Elf, one Dwarf,\nand a Wizard and one Hobbit) arrived at the Black Gate and challenged\nthe many remaining armies of Mordor. Their intention was to draw the\nwatchful Eye of Sauron away from Mount Doom, to allow Frodo the\nRing-bearer to cast the One Ring into the Crack of Doom and destroy it.\nThe delay worked and the Ring was destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom,\nfollowing which the Black Gate and the Towers of the Teeth immediately\ncollapsed.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe Black Gate's literal Sindarin translation, _Morannon_, means “Black\nGate” from _môr_ (“dark, black”) and _annon_ (“gate, door”).",

As for vegetation, Far\nHarad, at least the part closest to Gondor and Umbar consisted of\nscattered woodlands, and further into the south short grasslands until\nit ran into the desert. The deep southern region consisted of vast\ndensely forested areas with some hills.\n\nThe climate was mostly warm and humid with parts of Far Harad and Umbar\nhaving mild winters, hot, dry summers with warm breezes coming from the\nsea. The farther south had a semi-arid to an arid climate as it\nproceeded into the desert regions. The deep southern region’s climate\nwas unknown but was possibly mild compared to the others.\n\n\nInhabitants\n\nThe south is inhabited by the tribes of the Haradrim or Southrons,\nCorsairs of Umbar, and Black Númenóreans.

After the\nBattle of the Powers, the Great Sea (Belegaer) was widened and a Great\nGulf was made between the southern part of the Beleriand and the rest of\nthe continent, sundering the two parts from each other. The south could\nonly be reached through two land corridors: a narrow strip that ran\nthrough the land just below the White Mountains were the Nandor passed\nthrough after separating from the main host of the journeying elves, and\na larger corridor of land just below Cuiviénen and Hildórien.\n\nAfter the War of Wrath, the gulf between the northern part of the\ncontinent and the southern part was widened with the loss of the\nBeleriand and part of the land in the south, leaving a coastal area that\nwould once be called Umbar. The inland Sea of Helcar shrunk into the Sea\nof Rhûn and with this the south could now be approached by many ways,\nbarring the forces of evil that would later rule these lands. Throughout\nthe Second and Third ages, the south became populated with tribes of Men\nwho never really became civilized and thus were easily swayed by the\nDark Powers and were a constant threat to the Free Peoples of the West.\n\nAfter the Fall of Númenor in the Second Age, the Black Númenóreans who\nworshiped the Dark Powers settled there and became rulers of Umbar and\nhad a great influence on the Southrons. For a time, the south was ruled\nand influenced by the Dúnedain kingdom of Gondor but that was soon lost.\nPirates known as the Corsairs ruled Umbar up onto the War of the Ring.\nThe south from then on was populated by the enemies of the Free Peoples\nuntil pacified by King Aragorn II Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom after\nthe War of the Ring."

    "text": "_This article is on the large region in Middle-earth. For the land\nacross the ocean to the west see the Undying Lands._\n\nThe WEST refers to the large region Middle-earth and includes the lands\nof Beleriand (up to the end of the First Age) Lindon, Eriador, Gondor,\nRhovanion, and others, essentially all the lands west of Rhûn and\nMordor. It is also used to describe the Free Peoples of Middle-earth\nlike the Elves, Men, Dwarves, Hobbits and Ents particularly during the\nThird Age. West is normally 'the good' versus the bad from the East.\n(i.e. Sauron, Harad and Easterlings)\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe Beleriand consisted of mostly plains and lowlands with scattered\nwoodlands, dense forests, and grasslands. The lands of Hithlum, Mithrim,\nand Dor-lómin were plateaus consisting of short grasslands and scattered\nwoodlands surrounded by mountains. Dorthonion was mostly a plateau\nsurrounded by a mountain range in its south and consisted of moorlands\nand dense forests in its north. There were some hill lands such as the\nones near the Blue Mountains and Himring.\n\nThe Beleriand’s climate varied in degrees. The West Beleriand consisted\nof cold winter, cool to mild summers in the northern part with cold, dry\nprevailing winds from the north, and warm, moist prevailing winds from\nthe sea. The southern part consisted of mild winters, mild summers with\nwarm, moist prevailing winds coming primarily from the sea. The East\nBeleriand consisted of severe, dry winters, short, cool summers with\nstrong prevailing winds coming form the northern part near Morgoth’s\ndomain. The southern part had mild winters, mild summers with warm,\nmoist prevailing winds from the sea with the exception of the realms of\nMaedhros and Maglor between Dorthonion and the Blue Mountains, which had\ncold winters and mild summers due to their proximity to the north.\n\nAfter the fall of the Beleriand, the West’s terrain from Lindon to\nRhovanion and Gondor was mostly lowlands and plains consisting of mostly\nshrubs, shrubs thickets and scattered woodlands. Grasslands prevailed in\nRohan, formerly Calenardhon and dense forests were in areas such as\nFangorn and Mirkwood. Hill lands were mostly in mid-Eriador, next to\nMisty Mountains, the Wold in Rohan, and the lands east of the Grey\nMountains.\n\nThe climate variation was mostly the same as it was during the First Age\nwith severe winters and cool summers in the lands near the cold north,\nwith cold prevailing winds. Cold but milder weather conditions dominated\nnorthern Eriador and northern Rhovanion, and south from that mild\nconditions with a tendency toward fog existed throughout most of the\nrest of Eriador and the lands to the south, with warm, moist prevailing\nwinds coming from the sea. Southern Rhovanion was overall a bit colder\nthen the north possibly due to its shielding from the warmer prevailing\nwinds from the sea, from the Misty Mountains. Both Rohan and Gondor were\nwarmer climates due to their proximity to the south and the influence of\nthe warm prevailing winds from the sea.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the Years of the Trees and the First Age during the days of the\nBeleriand, the West consisted of mostly good races which were Moriquendi\nelves, Noldorin exiles, and later Edain men with some faithful\nEasterlings, and Dwarves living in the mountains. The enemy was in the\nNorth. With the destruction of the Beleriend, the West became the lands\nof Lindon, Eriador, Gondor, Rhovanion, and others with the East being\nthe lands of Rhûn and Mordor. In the Second Age, the West's population\nwas mostly primitive men and a few elves located mostly in Lindon,\nEregion, and some in Greenwood the Great. There were some tribes of Orcs\nliving in the Misty Mountains with some in the Grey Mountains. The\nenemies, Sauron and Easterlings mostly came from Mordor and Rhûn in the\nEast until their defeat during the War of the Last Alliance.\n\nIn the Third Age, the West was mostly nations of Men living in the\nRealms in Exile (Arnor and Gondor). Other races such as Dwarves and\nElves decreased in numbers becoming hidden peoples living in realms such\nas: Moria, the Lonely Mountain, Lothlórien, and Mirkwood. Hobbits, once\na minor race living in the Gladden Fields migrated to Bree and then The\nShire, the most populated of their realms. Ents diminished in numbers\nremained solely in Fangorn forest. The enemies from then on were\ntraditionally located in the East, though for some time many of the\nthreats came from within the West in places such as Angmar, Misty\nMountains, and Dol Guldur but during the latter half of the age the\nenemies were solely from the East.\n\nThe dominant language in the West during the First Age was Elvish and\nearly Mannish and later Westron prevailed with others being used only\nregionally."

The Orocarni Mountains still remained\nintact and unbroken.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Elves and Dwarves (in the mountains) were the first to inhabit the\nEast and still continued to do so even after many Elves left on the\nGreat Journey to Valinor. Later during the First Age, Men inhabited the\nland and quickly spread into the west but only the tribes of the Edain\nmoved into the Beleriand escaping the Dark Powers, while the earlier\nEasterling tribes stayed and continued to serve them.\n\nThroughout the Second and Third ages, the region still continued to be\ninhabited by the Easterlings who completely dominated the area and still\nserved the Dark Powers. The Easterlings also sometimes refer to their\nland as the Land of the Rising Sun. Dwarves probably still lived in the\nOrocarni mountain range as well as other men and creatures. The Blue\nWizards - Pallando and Alatar were said to have gone out there in\nwagons, but never returned. However, Tolkien never expanded much on this\narea.\n\nGenerally, throughout the three ages of Middle-earth the east has often\nbeen the source of those who served Morgoth and Sauron and other enemies\nof the Free Peoples."

    "text": "The _EPESSË_ is one of the three categories of Elven names, equivalent\nto a nickname or honorary title.\n\nElves were typically given two names (_essi_) at birth: a father-name\nand a mother-name. The _father-name_ is often based on the father's own\nname or (in later times) was derived from old legends. A father-name may\nactually be the same as the father's, with a suffix added, such is the\ncase with Gildor Inglorion. A _mother-name_ is given later at birth and\nhad great significance, as Elven mothers are said to hold great insight\ninto the character of their children. It is also believed that mothers\nhave the gift of prophecy in matters concerning their children.\n\nThe _epessë_ or the “after-name” is the third type. The after-name is\ngiven later in life, but not necessarily by their kin, as a title of\nadmiration. In some circumstances, the _epessë_ is chosen by the Elf\nhimself or herself. An Elf could be referred to by any of the three, but\nthe _epessë_ typically took preference.\n\nIn songs and history, the _epessë_ is usually used rather than the\n_essi_.\n\n\nExamples\n\n-   MAEDHROS, the oldest son of Fëanor, was by his brothers referred to\n    as _RUSSANDOL_ (copper-top): an _epessë_ he had earned because of\n    his ruddy hair. _Maedhros_ itself was an _epessë_: his father-name\n    had been _Nelyafinwë_ (Finwë the third: Fëanor's own father name had\n    been (Curu)finwë), and his mother-name _Maitimo_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   _GIL-GALAD_ (Star of Radiance) is the mother-name of _Rodnor_, son\n    of Orodreth. He is given the epessë _Ereinion_ because of his\n    heritage: the name literally means “Scion of Kings”.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   _CÍRDAN_ is the _epessë_ of a Telerin Elf who remained in Beleriand,\n    and later Lindon, until the end of the Third Age. His original name\n    had been forgotten, and he was referred to always as Círdan, a title\n    that had been given to him as Lord of the Falas before the First\n    Age.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   FINROD FELAGUND is usually referred to as _Felagund_ (hewer of\n    caves), an original derogatory nickname given to him because of his\n    dwellings at Nargothrond. Finrod adopted the name, and made it a\n    title of honour.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   _GALADRIEL_ is the Sindarin translation of Alatáriel, the latter\n    being the Telerin _epessë_ originally given to her by Celeborn.\n    _Galadriel_ means “Maiden Crowned by a Radiant Garland”.

On the western border, a long stone road\noutside the Deep Fosse ran for many dozens of miles also surrounded the\ncity. The only entrance was in the south through a set of Great Gates\nacross a bridge in the Deep Fosse.\n\n\n\nThe city was a host of Mallorn trees where the elves lived in flets a\ntop the trees. Located in the city's center, atop the largest Mallorn in\nthe city, was the flet of Celeborn and Galadriel and the Chamber of\nCeleborn.\n\nOther notable features were Galadriel’s garden and her mirror both in\nthe southeast quarter.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe building of the city was probably started by the Silvan-speaking\nNandor elves who first settled the forest area of Lórien during the Time\nof the Trees under the light of stars, and was no doubt completed and/or\nadded to throughout the ages by the city's later Sindarin lords. No\ndoubt beautiful during the days of Amdír and his son Amroth, it was\ntheir successors' Celeborn and his wife Galadriel that made the city\ninto a blissful but rather isolated Elven haven.\n\n\n\nDuring the events of the War of the Ring, the Fellowship of the Ring was\nbrought through Lórien to Caras Galadhon, and there met the lords of the\nGaladhrim. Around the time of the siege of Minas Tirith Lorien was\nbesieged itself by Dol Guldur, three times.\n\nDuring the Fourth Age, after Galadriel had left Lórien, Caras Galadhon\nwas ruled by a lonely Celeborn as capital of a Lórien which now spanned\nboth sides of the river Anduin, but at some point during the age he left\nfor Valinor as well, and Caras Galadhon slowly became depopulated. It is\nunclear just how this came about since most of Lórien's people were\nSilvan Elves and, presumably, not necessarily inclined to leave\nMiddle-earth so soon after Sauron's fall; there are different references\nto the Fate of the Elves of Middle-earth scattered throughout Tolkien's\npublished works. Caras Galadhon is called a “great city” in the Lord of\nthe Rings, and the impression is that its population numbered in the\nthousands. However, the “Tale of Aragorn and Arwen” in Appendix A\ndepicts Caras Galadhon as wholly abandoned by the time of Aragorn II\nElessar's death.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _CARAS GALADHON_ means “Fortress of Trees”: from the Silvan\n_caras_ (“fortress”) and _galadhon_ (“of trees”). It may also be\ntranslated as “Fortress of Galadhon”. _Galadhon_ may be referred to\nCeleborn's father, Galadhon.

Due to\ninformation passed by Maeglin, Morgoth's forces managed to surround the\ncity without being detected, coming over the Encircling Mountains at the\npoint where the watch was least vigilant and during a time of festival.\nBy the time the Elves became aware of them, the city was under siege,\nand there was no hope of victory or escape on the part of the defenders.\n\nFor many days the Elves of Gondolin held their ranks and the city. The\nbattles that raged beneath its walls were bloody and terrible -\ncourageous leaders and warriors, most predominantly Ecthelion and Tuor,\nbecame legends, and later songs and epic poems would be written about\nthem. Swords such as Orcrist and Glamdring earned their reputations\nhere, and became feared among orcs.\n\nHowever, Morgoth's armies were too numerous and powerful for the Elves\nto overcome, as they were comprised not only of Orcs and other mundane\nDark creatures, but of Balrogs and an entire brood of Dragons fathered\nby Glaurung. The defenders of the city managed to leave their mark on\nthe attackers, slaying at least two Balrogs, one of whom was Gothmog\nhimself, but ultimately, the battle was a complete and decisive victory\nfor Morgoth. With Gondolin's fall, the last of the great Elven kingdoms\nin Middle-earth was destroyed, and with it was destroyed any terrestrial\nhope of resisting Morgoth's power.\n\n\nCanon\n\nThe Fall of Gondolin is the third of the Great Tales, but was the first\nwritten by Tolkien, and is the second most complete of the tales (after\nThe Children of Húrin, and is less fractured than the materials used to\nmake up Beren and Lúthien (2017) as stand alone and 'continuous' as\npossible).\n\nThe sources for this major First Age event are the chapters “THE FALL OF\nGONDOLIN” of ''The Book of Lost Tales Part Two __ ''and “OF TUOR AND\nTHE FALL OF GONDOLIN” in _The Silmarillion_, which both tell of the\nfounding of the Elven city of Gondolin (built in secret by Turgon and\nhis people), of the arrival Tuor, a prince of the Edain, of the betrayal\nof the city to Morgoth by Turgon's nephew Maeglin, and of its subsequent\ndestruction by Morgoth's armies. There is also an unpublished poem:\n_The Lay of the Fall of Gondolin_\n\nThe _Lost Tales_ chapter goes more in depth than the account in _The\nSilmarillion_, telling notably in detail of Tuor's and Ecthelion's feats\nin battle, and mentioning every captain of the Houses of the\nGondolindrim.\n\nBackground\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien actually began writing the story that would become “The\nFall of Gondolin” in 1917, in an army barracks on the back of a sheet of\nmilitary marching music. It is more or less the first traceable story he\never wrote down on paper about the Middle-earth legendarium.\n\nBecause Tolkien was constantly revising his First Age stories, the\nnarrative he wrote in 1917 (published posthumously in _The Book of Lost\nTales Part Two_) remains the only full account of the fall of the city.\nThe narrative in _The Silmarillion_ was the result of the editing by his\nson Christopher of various different sources.\n\nA partial new version of “The Fall of Gondolin” was published in the\n_Unfinished Tales_ under the title “Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin”.\nActually titled “Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin”, this narrative shows\na great expansion of the earlier tale. It can be surmised from this text\nthat Tolkien would have rewritten the entire story, but for reasons that\nare not known he abandoned the text before Tuor actually arrives in the\ncity. For this reason Christopher Tolkien retitled the story before\nincluding it in _Unfinished Tales_.",

The finest of these pieces was the Nauglamír.\n\nThe Nauglamír was the second-greatest treasure of Doriath, prized above\nall but Beren and Lúthien's Silmaril. After the smiths of Belegost\nfinished their work on the Nauglamír, Thingol requested that the Dwarves\nof Nogrod set the Silmaril in it. The Nauglamír, now bearing the\nSilmaril was held to be the fairest object in Arda.\n\nEnthralled by its beauty and greedy for the Silmaril, the dwarves\ndemanded the necklace insisting that as dwarf work it belonged to them.\nThingol was unwilling to surrender the treasure and replies with an\nimpertinent answer. In their anger, the Dwarves slew him. Two escaped to\nNogrod and told a much different story to their kinsmen, persuading the\ncity to march on Doriath.\n\nAfter the Fall of Doriath, the Dwarves of Nogrod marched homewards with\nthe stolen Nauglamír and the rest of the treasures of that land but\nBeren, at the head of an army of Laiquendi and Ents slew the dwarves.\nThe treasure was cast into the Ascar save the Nauglamír, which Beren\ngave to Lúthien.\n\nAfter Beren and Lúthien's final deaths, the necklace was inherited by\ntheir son, Dior, who became the second King of Doriath. When the Sons of\nFëanor heard that the inheritor of the throne of Doriath, they demanded\nthat he surrender it to them or become their enemy. When he refused,\nthis brought about the Second Kinslaying as the Sons of Fëanor, seeking\nthe Silmaril in accordance with the Oath of Fëanor, attacked Doriath.\nDior's daughter, Elwing, escaped the kinslaying with the Nauglamír,\nfleeing to the Mouths of Sirion.\n\nIn the Third Kinslaying, the Sons of Fëanor attacked the Elven havens in\nthe Mouths of Sirion, still trying to obtain the Silmaril within the\nNauglamír but Elwing cast herself into the sea with it rather than\nsurrender the gem to Maedhros and Maglor. The Nauglamír was lost, while\nElwing and the Silmaril were saved by the Vala Ulmo.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn an earlier myth of First Age lore that preceded the final stories in\n_The Silmarillion_, namely the Lost Tale _The Nauglafring_, the\nNauglamír (named the NAUGLAFRING) is more important: the necklace\nbecomes caught behind a tree branch when Thingol is riding outside the\nGirdle of Melian and is attacked by the Dwarves. Thingol is unhorsed and\nslain. Following this, Melian's protection is lifted and Doriath is\nsacked."

Nob and Bob were two hobbits that worked under him: Nob was a\ngeneral servant, and Bob was as a ostler, tending to the horses and\nponies.\n\nIn the years leading up to the fabled Quest for Erebor, Gandalf the Grey\nmet up with Thorin Oakenshield at The Prancing Pony by chance. Thorin\nwished to slay Smaug the dragon and claim his rightful title of King\nunder the Mountain. Gandalf spoke with him and then would aid him in\nfinding a burglar.\n\nFrodo Baggins stayed at this inn in TA 3018 while traveling to Rivendell\nwith his three companions, having been told by Gandalf to meet him\nthere. They encountered Aragorn (“Strider”), and allowed him to join\ntheir company. On the night of their stay, the hobbits feared the Black\nRiders who had been searching for them, so they avoided sleeping in\ntheir rooms, and stayed with Aragorn. That night, their rooms were\nindeed searched and ravaged by some of the Ringwraiths. The hobbits and\nAragorn made off through the Lowlands the next day.",

During the Years of the Trees when the Valar removed to Aman,\nthe first real and dense forests arose and spread throughout\nMiddle-earth in parts of the Beleriand, in Eriador where a vast forest\nreigned for many thousands of years, and some in the land of Rhovanion\nwhere Greenwood stood. The vast lands of the south of Middle-earth and\nmuch of the Dark Land where very few people lived also had many dense\nforested areas. All forests in the Beleriand perished with its\ndestruction at the end of the First Age.\n\nSecond Age\n\nThe vast primordial forests in Eriador stood until the middle of this\nage when the Númenóreans began cutting them down to built their fleets\nand fuel their desire for empire and dominion.

    "text": "CALACIRYA, also known as the PASS OF LIGHT, was a narrow pass that led\nthrough the chain of mountains known as the Pelóri, north of Taniquetil.\n\nThe walls of the mountain pass are high and steep but presumably not\ndangerous. The pass itself is somewhat narrow, but wide enough to have a\nlarge hill within it and a small stream.\n\nThe city of Tirion was set on the hill of Túna, which is between the\nCalacirya closest to the light of Valinor.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the pass was created, there was no way to get into Valinor but\nwhen the Quendi began their journey westward towards the Blessed Realm,\nthey eventually were not able to enter due to The Pelóri blocking the\nway, so the Valar opened a narrow pass in the great mountains. The Valar\nwould have preferred to closed the mountains entirely but, realizing\nthat the elves, even the Vanyar, needed to be able to breath the outside\nair, they kept Calacirya open.\n\nThey also did not want to wholly separate the Vanyar and Ñoldor from the\nTeleri on the coast. The Valar then opened the pass in the side of The\nPelóri and the Noldor and Vanyar entered and resided in the city of\nTirion, which is set right in the middle of the pass. The Teleri did not\nleave the island of Tol Eressëa until much later and even then, they did\nnot enter Valinor but stayed rather on the eastern coast of Aman under\nthe afternoon shadow of The Pelóri in a city named Alqualondë.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Calacirya_ is a Quenyan word that meant 'Cleft of Light'. Earlier forms\nof the word were 'Kalakirya' and 'Kalakilya'. Later forms were and\n'Kalakiryan' and 'Calaciryan'."

On its\npeak stood Durin's Tower. It was one of the three Mountains of Moria,\nalong with Caradhras and the Fanuidhol, under which lay the ancient\nDwarf realm of Khazad-dûm.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Dwarves called the mountain-summit Zirakzigil. In ancient times,\nthey built the Endless Stair - a spiral staircase of many thousand steps\n- from the roots of the mountain up to its peak. On an eyrie atop the\nmountain they built Durin's Tower. By the end of the Third Age, the\nstair and the tower were remembered only in legend.\n\nThen, on January 23, 3019, Gandalf and the Balrog climbed the Endless\nStair to the summit of the Silvertine. There they fought the Battle of\nthe Peak, which lasted three days. During the battle, Durin's Tower was\ndestroyed and the stairs were blocked. The Balrog of Moria was finally\ndestroyed. Gandalf the Grey died and was soon returned to life as\nGandalf the White. Gandalf was rescued from the Silvertine by Gwaihir\nthe Windlord on February 17, 3019.\n\n\n\n\nEtymology\n\nA _tine_ is a point or prong. _Celebdil_ is derived from _celeb_ meaning\n“silver” and _til_ (modified to -_dil)_ meaning “horn,” or\n“point.” The translation of ''Zirakzigil ''is most likely “silver\nspike,” but it is not clear which element means “silver” and which means\n“spike.” A note written by J.R.R. Tolkien proposed that _zirak_ meant\n“silver” and _zigil_ meant “spike” but a later note said the reverse -\nthat _zigil_ meant “silver” and _zirak_ meant “spike.”"

    "text": "The MALLORN (pl. _MELLYRN_) was a kind of large tree that throughout\nhistory only grew in Aman, Númenor, Lindon, and Lórien in the Eastern\nlands of Middle-earth.\n\n\nDescription\n\nMellyrn were similar to beech trees in that their bark was smooth and\nsilver-grey, but their leaves, which were green above and silver\nbeneath, were much larger and longer than beech trees, and turned a\nclear gold in autumn. The golden leaves did not fall like other\ndeciduous trees, but remained on the tree throughout the winter, only\nfalling in the spring, when golden flowers bloomed on the branches and\nnew leaves sprouted, turning the entire forest a bright gold. There is\nthe sense that mallorn trees were more alive or had a greater presence\nthan other trees. Frodo Baggins explained that he could feel the “life\nof the tree” when he touched a mallorn in Lothlórien.\n\n\nHistory\n\nMallorn-trees originally grew on Tol Eressëa, and probably also grew in\nValinor. The Ñoldor may have introduced mellyrn to Gondolin when they\ncame to Middle-earth, but these were all destroyed with the city. The\nElves of Tol Eressëa brought mallorn-trees to the Men of Númenor and\nthey grew on the shores around the Bay of Eldanna in that land. Even\nTar-Aldarion, the great Ship-King, did not cut down these trees.\n\nMellorn-nuts were once given by Tar-Aldarion, a Ship-King of Númenor, to\nhis friend Gil-galad, the Ñoldorin King of Lindon. The mellyrn did not\ngrow in Lindon, but Galadriel took some nuts with her to Lothlórien,\nwhere they grew to immense heights. Lothlórien became known as the\n_Golden Wood_, per its name's translation, because of them.\n\nThe Fellowship spent its first night in Lothlorien on flets (wooden\nplatforms) built onto the upper branches of several adjacent mallorn\ntrees. In this case the flets were of simple construction with light\nwoven movable walls to block the wind. These mallorn trees were on the\nNorth Eastern edge of Lothlorien, close by the tributary river of\nNimrodel or Silverlode.\n\nCaras Galadhon, the city of Galadriel and Celeborn within Lothlórien,\nwas built in the branches of huge mallorn-trees, with a large hall built\ninto the upper branches of the tallest tree at the centre of the city.\nThe large horizontal branches of the mallorn lent themselves to being\nused in this way. The Fellowship were later given lembas the elvish\nwaybread wrapped in mallorn-leaves. The mallorn leaf wrapping helped\nkeep the waybread fresh and helped sustain its capacity to keep people\nalive for long periods in the absence of other foods.\n\nGaladriel gave Samwise Gamgee a box of soil from her garden containing a\nsingle silver mallorn nut. After the War of the Ring, Sam planted the\nnut in the Shire, in the Party Field where the Party Tree had stood.\nFrom the nut grew a new Mallorn-tree that became the new party tree. It\nwas the only mallorn-tree in Middle-earth outside of Lórien. When the\ntree bloomed the next spring and summer it became the wonder of the\nneighbourhood and in time a place of pilgrimage; an image of times long\npast and a thing of beauty and wonder. . Symbolically, this specific\ntree acts as the living sign of the special blessing and thanks which\nthe Shire receives for the efforts of Frodo, Samwise, Meriadoc and\nPeregrin in the struggle against Sauron and Saruman; as well as a nod to\nthe essential and simple good qualities of the hobbit people and their\nclose relationship to their lands.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name is derived from the Sindarin terms _malt_ (“gold”) and _orn_\n(“tree”).\n\nMALINORNË is the Quenya name for Mallorn."

They differed from normal dwarves in various ways: they were\nsmaller, far more unsociable, and they freely gave away their names;\nother dwarves kept their Khuzdul names and language a secret.\n\n\nHistory\n\n The Petty-dwarves were dwarves of\nseveral houses, which had been exiled for reasons unknown in very\nancient times during the Peace of Arda. They were the first to cross the\nBlue Mountains (Ered Luin) in the First Age, and established strongholds\nin Beleriand before the building of Nogrod and Belegost in the Blue\nMountains, and before the elves arrived. They delved the very ancient\nsettlements of Nulukkizdin (Nargothrond) and Amon Rûdh but they dwindled\nbefore the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth.\n\nThe Sindar, not yet acquainted with dwarves, thought the Petty-dwarves\nwere animals, and hunted them. Not until the dwarves of the Ered Luin\nestablished contact with the Sindar did the latter realize what the\nPetty-dwarves were. Afterwards they were mostly left alone, but not\nbefore the Petty-dwarves came to hate all elves with a passion.\n\nBy the time of the War of the Jewels, after the Return of the Ñoldor,\nthe Petty-dwarves had nearly died out. By the fifth Century of the First\nAge, the last remnant of their people were Mîm and his two sons, who\nlived at Amon Rûdh. Túrin and his men shot at the dwarves, mistaking\nthem for animals or orcs. Mim survived, but an arrow had killed one of\nhis sons, Khîm. Mim's other son had been killed by orcs, leaving Mim the\nlast of his kind. Mîm was killed by Húrin after the latter's release\nfrom Angband, and the Petty-dwarves were no more.\n\n\nOrigin in Tolkien's writings\n\nThe Petty-dwarves were created from remnant ideas based on the Nauglath\nin Tolkien's earliest writings in the _The Book of Lost Tales_. They\nwere more or less created to explain the difference between the dwarves\nlater writings such as The Hobbit in comparison to the wicked dwarves\nfrom his earlier stories which he hadn't yet completely abandoned.\nHowever, some of the ideas of the Nauglath were reincorporated into the\nNaugrim (Dwarves) by J.R.R.

Amon\nAnwar stood up out of a great wood around its feet. The hill was long\nand sloping and the wood went almost to the summit.\n\nWhile it was considered the centre of Gondor, it would be better\ndescribed as the spiritual centre of Gondor, as it was _the high place\nnearest to the centre of a line from the inflow of the Limlight down to\nthe southern cape of Tolfalas and the distance to it was equal from the\nFords of Isen and Minas Tirith_.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Tomb of Elendil\n\nAfter the War of the Last Alliance, Isildur defined the bounds of Gondor\nand, upon discovering that this was the centre of Gondor, he entombed\nhis father Elendil here and it was at this time that the hill's name\nbecame AMON ANWAR, as Isildur had called the protection of the Valar\nupon that hilltop, and they had granted it. Isildur swore all those\npresent to secrecy and forbade anyone save an Heir of Elendil from\ndisturbing it. The tomb then stayed untouched by any save the Kings of\nGondor and later, their Stewards.\n\nThe Oath of Eorl\n\nIn the time of the twelfth Ruling Steward, Cirion, Gondor was faced with\na massive invasion of a land they could not protect, Calenardhon which\nhad been depopulated in the Great Plague of 1636, though it had not been\ngreatly populated to begin with. Cirion called upon the aid of the\nÉothéod and in return for their aid, he surrendered Calenardhon to them,\nUntil the Great King should return. Although by this time the lives of\neleven Stewards had passed before him, no one in Gondor ever expected\nthat the King would return.\n\nCirion took Eorl, the Lord of the Éothéod to the hallowed site of AMON\nANWAR and there before the Tomb of Elendil they swore what would be in\nlater days known as the Oath of Eorl, giving Calenardhon to the Éothéod,\nand promising eternal friendship between the two Kingdoms. As Amon Anwar\nwas no longer the centre of Gondor, rather its border, Cirion removed\nthe Casket that Isildur had set upon the hill two thousand years earlier\nto Rath Dínen, the Silent Street, where all other Kings of Gondor were\nentombed.\n\nThe Warning Beacon\n\nAmon Anwar was the seventh and last of the Warning beacons of Gondor\nwhich gave the final warning or message to Rohan. It stood overlooking\nthe Firien wood which was just outside the border of Rohan near the\nMering Stream. Also, chain of Warning Beacons was established along the\nline of the White Mountains to warn South Gondor of danger in\nCalenardhon, and vice-versa. Later this was used to warn Anorien of\nDanger to Gondor and Rohan also. The westernmost and last built beacon\nwas situated upon AMON ANWAR, and was only created after the Tomb of\nElendil was removed to Rath Dínen, as no Lord of Gondor, King or steward\nhad permitted the construction of a beacon whilst Elendil still remained\nthere.\n\nEven after Elendil was removed to Minas Tirith, the Awe still remained\nupon the hill, and its surrounding forest. The Beacon Wardens would live\nclose to the Summit only for short watches in specially constructed\ncabins. Except when there was a noise of animals in the forest, or of\nfolk along the road, they would find themselves speaking to their\ncompanions in whispers, as if they expected a great voice from long ago\nto speak. The Wardens were the only people to live in those woods, and\nwere glad when their tour of duty was over. The mound of Elendil's Tomb\nremained upon the top of the hill from the time that Isildur hallowed it\nuntil the Changing of the world, always in a well-kept, green field.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_AMON ANWAR_ was Sindarin for 'Hill of Awe'.",

    "text": "WEREWOLVES were servants of Morgoth, bred from wolves and inhabited by\ndreadful spirits (fallen lesser Maiar or the fëar  of orcs)\nimprisoned in these wolfish forms by Sauron. Unlike werewolves of other\nliterature, the werewolves of Middle-earth do not transform from man to\nwolf at night and their behavior is not influenced by the full moon or\nother lunar cycles.\n\nThey inhabited Tol-in-Gaurhoth, which became known as the Isle of\nWerewolves.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\n The first werewolf was Draugluin at Tol-in-Gaurhoth, and the greatest\nwerewolf after him was Carcharoth, the guardian of Angband, and a\ndescendant of Draugluin as all other werewolves were. The form of the\nwerewolves was first thought of by Sauron, who was their lord, and took\nthe shape of a great wolf himself at least once.\n\nGandalf suggests in his talks with Frodo after the Ford of Bruinen that\nwerewolves survived into the Third Age, and makes a distinction between\nthem and wargs. The latter, though, might simply be descended from\nwerewolves, as they could speak, suggesting they had fëar (souls).\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nThe werewolves of Middle-earth were not shape-shifters, and were always\nin the form of great beasts. The fangs of Carcharoth were venomous,\nthough it is not known if all werewolves had venomous fangs.\n\nWerewolves are similar to wolves and wargs, and were quite large even\ncompared to wargs. Known to be stronger and faster than the famous warg\nrace, they were also as intelligent as a mortal man, which made them\ncapable of negotiating and communicating with others. Thus they were\nable to speak the Black Speech, Westron, and the Elvish languages.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _werewolf_ appears to have been chosen because they were in\nessence sapient (but evil), and thus had a status similar to men rather\nthan beasts — the word \"_were\"_ in the word _werewolf_ being from the\nAnglo-Saxon word _were_, meaning man, so the term werewolf can be\ntranslated to man-wolf.

    "page_id": "3784",
    "text": "_ON FAIRY-STORIES_ is an essay written by J. R. R. Tolkien that was\npublished as a book.\n\nTolkien originally wrote the essay in 1939 for his lecture on the\nsubject of Fairly Tales in general to an audience at University of St.\nAndrews in Scotland. Afterwards, it was first published within _Essays\nPresented to Charles Williams_ in 1947. It was then subsequently\npublished with _Leaf by Niggle_ in _Tree and Leaf_ as well as in _The\nTolkien Reader_, around 1966. It has since been renewed as an Expanded\nedition (pictured right), edited by Tolkien scholars Verlyn Flieger and\nDouglas Anderson, in 2008.\n\nThe essay contains Tolkien's explanation of his philosophy on fantasy\nand on “faerie”, and thoughts on the crafting of the mythos.\n\n\nSummary\n\nTolkien named the genre _Fairy Stories,_ which he carefully\ndistinguishes from actual “Fairy Tales”. This distinction seems to be\ntwofold. First, he defines _fairy stories_ as not stories about fairies\nor other supernatural beings, but stories about the interaction between\nhumans and those beings. Second, he emphasizes that through the use of\nfantasy, which he equates with fancy and imagination, the author can\nbring the reader to experience a world which is consistent and rational,\nyet utterly strange as well. He calls this “a rare achievement of Art”,\nand notes that it was important to him as a reader: “It was in\nfairy-stories that I first divined the potency of the words, and the\nwonder of things, such as stone, and wood, and iron; tree and grass;\nhouse and fire; bread and wine.”\n\nHaving defined the genre, Tolkien goes on to defend its utility on three\ngrounds. First, suggesting that fairy stories allow the reader to review\nhis or her own world from the “perspective” of a different world. This\nconcept, which shares much in common with cultural relativism, Tolkien\ncalls “recovery”, in the sense that one's unquestioned assumptions might\nbe recovered and changed by an outside perspective. Second, he defends\nfairy stories as offering escapist pleasure to the reader. And third,\nTolkien suggests that fairy stories (can) provide moral or emotional\nconsolation, through their happy ending, which he terms a\n“eucatastrophe”."

This would have been\npart of a preface to George MacDonald's famous faerie story _The Golden\nKey_. But the story grew from there and became a tale in its own right.\n\nThe most recent edition includes a previously unpublished essay by\nTolkien, explaining the background and just why the elf-king spent so\nlong in Wooton Major. It also explains how the story grew from this\nfirst idea into the published version.\n\nThe book was originally called “THE GREAT CAKE”, but the title was\nchanged to “SMITH OF WOOTTON MAJOR” in an attempt to suggest an early\nwork by P.G. Wodehouse.\n\nIt is not definitely connected to the Middle-earth legendarium. Both\n_Faery_ and Valinor are lands outside of the normal world, but Valinor\ncannot normally be visited by mortals. There are lesser Elven kingdoms\nthat humans can visit and return: Faramir mentions visitors to Lorien.\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe village of Wootton Major is well-known around the countryside for\nits annual festivals, which are particularly famous for their culinary\ndelights. The biggest festival of them all is the Feast of Good\nChildren. This festival is celebrated only once every twenty-four years,\nand the celebrations take the form of a party to which twenty-four\nchildren of the village are invited. The highpoint of the party is the\nGreat Cake, which is remarkable for its hidden magical ingredients.\nWhoever swallows one of these is given the rare gift of an entry into\nthe Land of Faery.\n\nThis year the magic star hidden inside the Great Cake was eaten by a\nblacksmith’s son. The boy did not feel any of its magical properties at\nonce but on the morning of his tenth birthday the star fixed itself on\nhis forehead and marked him as one intimate with the Faeryfolk. This boy\ngrew up to be a blacksmith like his father, but in his free time he\nroamed into the Land of Faery. The star on his forehead protected him\nfrom the evils threatening mortals in that land, and the Folk called him\nStarbrow and told him about their land and its hidden beauties and\ndangers.\n\nThe years passed and it was now time for another Feast of Good Children.\nSmith had had his precious gift for most of his life now and the time\nhad come for it to be passed on to some other child. So he gave up the\nstar, and the mysterious new Master Cook baked it into the festive cake\nonce more."

The weapons of the Dwarves had long handles to\nextend their reach and increase their impact. There were several\ndifferent types of axes, including single-bladed and double-bladed axes\nas well as throwing axes. Many Dwarves carried more than one Axe. The\nthrowing axe had a foot-long handle and kept most of its weight in the\nblade, to increase the force with which it would hit the target. It had\na range of only ten yards or so and was much smaller than the walking\naxe. A walking axe had a square handle and was about three feet long; it\nhad a single blade so the user could use it as a walking staff. Unlike\ntheir depiction in many fiction settings, double bladed axes (also\ncalled double-bitted axes) are used in logging, while battle axes have\none blade, and sometimes a spike. An Axe could also be used as tool,\nserving multiple purposes.\n\nThe Sindar of the First Age were lightly armed in battle, and used axes\nas well. Some of the Orcs of Mordor and Minas Morgul also used crude\naxes.\n\nHurin used an axe before he was captured by Morgoth's forces. He used it\nto slay most of Gothmog's troll bodyguard, before the troll's blood\nmelted the blade.\n\nMany of the Beornings, most famously Beorn, were known to have wielded\naxes to chop wood and to use as a primary weapon.\n\nSaruman's Orc-men were noted to have used battle axes.\n\nAxes were one of the four main weapons used by the Rohirrim."

    "page_id": "3781",
    "text": "FARMER GILES OF HAM (written in 1947, published in 1949) is a short\nMiddle Earth story written by J. R. R. Tolkien. The story describes a\nseries of encounters between Farmer Giles and a wily Dragons named\nChrysophylax. It is set in a fantasy Britain of long ago, which has\nmythical creatures, medieval knights, and primitive firearms. It is\nhappily anachronistic, and is more like a folk-tale than the sweeping\nepics which Tolkien is better known for. The book was originally\nillustrated by Pauline Baynes.\n\n\nPlot\n\nFarmer Giles was not a hero. He was fat and red-bearded and enjoyed a\nslow, comfortable life. One day a rather deaf and short-sighted giant\nblundered on to his land. Farmer Giles managed to scare him away with a\nblunderbluss shot in its general direction. The people of the village\ncheered: Farmer Giles was a hero. His reputation spread far and wide\nacross the kingdom. Giles was rewarded by the King of the Middle\nKingdom, with a sword named Caudimordax or “Tailbiter”, a powerful\nweapon against dragons.\n\nThe giant reports to its monstrous friends that there are no more\nknights, just stinging flies (actually scrap metal from Giles'\nblunderbuss), in the Middle Kingdom. This prompts a dragon, Chrysophylax\nDives, to investigate the area and everyone turns to the accidental hero\nFarmer Giles to deal with it.\n\nThe story makes light of the great dragon-slaying traditions. The\nknights who are supposed to do the job are useless fops more intent on\n“precedence and etiquette” than on noticing huge dragon footprints\nlittering the landscape. “Giles” is also an interesting commentary on\nhow people react to danger. Heroes aren't simply called for, they are\ndemanded and hapless farmers can be forced to be heroes.\n\nThe Latin names and references imply that Giles is a Briton, a late\ngeneration remnant of the old empire after the decline of the western\nauthority of the Romans. All the Giles place-names are supposed to occur\nrelatively close to Oxford, along the Thames or on the route from London\nto Oxford.\n\nAmong the jokes is a question put to “the four wise clerks of Oxenford”;\nTolkien then quotes from the Oxford English Dictionary, on which he had\nworked. The phrase “wise clerk of Oxenford” is also a reference to\nChaucer's Clerk.\n\n“Farmer Giles of Ham” is sometimes published in an omnibus edition with\n“Smith of Wootton Major”, another Tolkien novella with illustrations by\nPauline Baynes.\n\nIt is rumored that farmer Giles in really Hamwise Gamgee but it is very\nunlikely since Hamwise did not believe in Dragons."

    "text": "The BATTLE OF THE CAMP was a battle between Gondor and the Wainriders.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nThe Wainriders were beginning to recover from their defeat at Dagorlad\nand were apparently not completely driven out by the rebellion in\nRhovanion, and now in TA 1944 made an alliance with Khand and Harad. The\nnew Éothéod lord, Forthwini found out about this and warned King Ondoher\nof it. Meanwhile, Eärnil, based at Pelargir received this news on the\nninth day of Cermië and prepared a force that crossed the river Anduin\nin part, leaving the Fords of the Poros purposely undefended.\n\nPrelude\n\nThe northern assault of the Wainriders was met by the King of Gondor\nhimself, Ondoher, with his two sons Artamir and Faramir. The Easterlings\nswept through Gondor's defence, cutting down the King and his heirs and\nrouting his army. While the Wainriders attacked Ithilien from the north,\nthe armies of the Haradrim crossed the Poros and invaded Southern\nIthilien. The Gondor Captain Eärnil had led Gondor's inferior Southern\nArmy to victory over the Haradrim, destroying their army in South\nIthilien, to the north of the Poros. After his victory, Eärnil turned\nnorth.\n\nThe Battle\n\nBelieving their victory complete, and Gondor defenceless before them and\napparently unaware of the defeat of their allies in the south, the\nWainriders paused in North Ithilien to celebrate their conquest. The\nfeasting Wainriders suddenly found their success reversed, as Eärnil\nappeared with his Southern Army, reinforced by fleeing members of\nOndoher's defeated northern troops. Eärnil's army descended on the\nunprepared Wainriders, driving many of them into the swamplands of the\nDead Marshes. That eastern people, for so long a dreaded enemy of\nGondor, never marched against Gondor again. The battle was named after\nwhere it had taken place: the Battle of the Camp.\n\nAftermath\n\nBecause there was no heir apparent to the throne, Ondoher and his sons\nhaving been killed in the battle, Eärnil was made King. He was a distant\nrelative of Ondoher, and could trace his lineage back to Elendil and\nAnárion of old.\n\nEärnil's victory is counted as one of the biggest military successes in\nthe history of middle earth. With a numerically inferior army than the\none that went north, Eärnil was able to totally rout the entire allied\narmies of Harad and Khand a feat that would not be duplicated until the\nend of the Third Age at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. The\nsubsequent promotion of Eärnil to the throne of Gondor gave the southern\nDúnedain a boost to moral that had been needed since their many losses\nduring the plague and the invasions that followed. It also helped\nimprove relations with the northern kingdom of Arnor. Eärnil's promise\nof support to Arnor reforged ties that had been hanging by a thread for\nseveral centuries. The stunning success north of the Poros had positive\nrepercussions throughout the Free Peoples of Middle-earth.",

Men also\nbegan establishing themselves in Dale and Laketown and good relations\nbetween the dwarves and men prospered for many years.

This was divided into 8766 six-day\n“weeks”, or _enquier_. They also recognised the solar year, which was\ncalled a _coranar_ (“sun-round”) or _loa_ (“growth”). In Rivendell, the\n_loa_ began on the spring equinox and was divided into six “months” or\nseasons, as follows.\n\n  QUENYA NAME   SINDARIN NAME   ENGLISH TRANSLATION   DURATION\n  ------------- --------------- --------------------- ----------\n  _tuilë_       _ethuil_        Spring                54 days\n  _lairë_       _laer_          Summer                72 days\n  _yávië_       _iavas_         Autumn                54 days\n  _quellë_      _firith_        Fading                54 days\n  _hrívë_       _rhîw_          Winter                72 days\n  _coirë_       _echuir_        Stirring              54 days\n\nFive other days, two between _coirë_ and _tuilë_ (called _Yestare_ and\n_Mettare_) and three between _yávië_ and _hrívë_ (called the _enderi_),\nmeant the calendar added up to 365 days. Irregularities were allowed for\nby adding another three days every twelve years, except the last year of\na _yén_.\n\nThe year (_loa_) begins on March 21st. That day is called _Yestare_. The\nnext day begins the season of _tuile_. _Tuil'e_ ends on May 14th.\n_Laire _begins on May 15th and ends on July 25th. _Yavie_ begins on July\n26th and ends on September 17th. The next three days are the _enderi_\n(September 18th, 19th, and 20th). _Quelle_begins on September 21st and\nends on November 13th. Then'' Hrive ''starts on the 14th. It ends on\nJanuary 24th. _Coire _begins on January 25th and ends on March 19th. The\nnext day is ''Mettare. '' These dates only work until the enderi have\nbeen doubled. Once every twelve years the elves would double the\n''enderi ''to replace having a leap year.\n\n\nNúmenórean Calendar\n\nThe calendar adopted by the Men of Middle-earth was called the King's\nReckoning, and was very similar to our own. It had a week of seven days,\nand divided the 365-day year of the Elves into twelve months (_astar_),\nten with 30 days and two with 31. Also like our calendar, the Númenórean\nyear began in midwinter. They retained the two days between the end of\none year and the start of the next (_mettarë_ and _yestarë_), but\nreduced the mid-year days to one (_loëndë_, essentially adding the other\ntwo to the mid-year “long months”). Leap years had two mid-year days. In\nthe Second and Third Ages, years were reckoned from the beginning of the\nAge.\n\nVarious irregularities occurred in this calendar, especially following\nthe Downfall. In TA 2060, Mardil Voronwë revised the calendar, and the\nnew version became the Steward's Reckoning. The months of Steward's\nReckoning all had 30 days, and there were two additional “extra” days at\nthe equinoxes, _tuilérë_ and _yáviérë_. The five extra days (the\nequinoxes, midsummer and two at midwinter) were holidays.\n\nIn TA 3021, the Reunited Kingdom adopted a New Reckoning, which began\nthe year on the spring equinox, as in the Elven calendar.\n\nThe months of the Reckonings were in Quenya (or Sindarin among the\nDúnedain) and were:\n\n  QUENYA NAME   SINDARIN NAME\n  ------------- ---------------\n  Narvinyë      Narwain\n  Nénimë        Nínui\n  Súlìmë        Gwaeron\n  Víressë       Gwirith\n  Lótessë       Lothron\n  Náríë         Nórui\n  Cermië        Cerveth\n  Urimë         Urui\n  Yavannië      Ivanneth\n  Narquelië     Narbeleth\n  Hísimë        Hithui\n  Ringarë       Girithron\n\n\nHobbit Calendar\n\n(More detail can be found under Shire Calendar)\n\nThe Hobbits, who had adopted the King's Reckoning, altered it in a\ndifferent way from the Steward's Reckoning. Like the Steward's\nReckoning, they had twelve months of thirty days, and five holidays\noutside the months. However, they had three “extra” days in midsummer\nand two in midwinter, similar to the Elven calendar. In the Shire the\nthree days of midsummer were called Lithedays, and the two days of\nmidwinter were the Yuledays. In leap years, the extra day was added to\nthe Lithedays and called Overlithe. The other innovation in the Shire\ncalendar was to make Midsummer's Day (and the Overlithe) outside the\nweek, as well as the month, meaning the days of the week would not\nchange in relation to the days of the year. The Shire Reckoning is the\ncalendar used in the _Red Book of Westmarch_, and hence in _The Lord of\nthe Rings_. It counts from the founding of the Shire in TA 1600.\n\nThe Hobbit names of the months came from names used in Anduin in\nantiquity, and their meanings were often obscure or forgotten. They\nwere:\n\n  SHIRE NAME      BREE NAME\n  --------------- ------------------------\n  2 Yule          2 Yule\n  Afteryule       Frery\n  Solmath         Solmath\n  Rethe           Rethe\n  Astron          Chithing\n  Thrimidge       Thrimidge\n  Forelithe       Lithe\n  1 Lithe         First Summerday\n  Midyear's Day   Second Summerday\n  Overlithe       Third Summerday\n  2 Lithe         Third/Fourth Summerday\n  Afterlithe      Mede\n  Wedmath         Wedmath\n  Halimath        Harvestmath\n  Winterfilth     Wintring\n  Blotmath        Blooting\n  Foreyule        Yulemath\n  1 Yule          1 Yule\n\n(Given the decidedly Old English sound of these names, it can be assumed\nthat this is J.R.R.

A drawing of the Inscription appears in Book I,\nChapter 2 of _The Fellowship of the Ring_, “The Shadow of the Past”. A\ntransliteration appears in Book II, Chapter 2, “The Council of Elrond”,\nwhere the inscription is read by Gandalf (listen to the inscription):\n\n  _Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh\n  burzum-ishi krimpatul._\n\n\n\nThese words, in the Black Speech of Mordor, are physically painful to\nall the free people of middle earth, except hobbits, who are especially\nresistant to evil. At the Council of Elrond, most probably because of\nthe power and the shadow they bring (the Shadow being the more harmful\nto the elves), Elrond is seen looking very annoyed when the inscription\nis read.

The entire poem reads:\n\nGandalf first learned of the Ring-inscription when he read the account\nthat Isildur had written before marching north to his death and the loss\nof the Ring. When Isildur had cut the ring from Sauron's hand, it was\nburning hot, and so Isildur was able to transcribe the inscription\nbefore it faded.\n\nWhen Gandalf subsequently heated the ring that Bilbo had found and\npassed on to Frodo, the inscription appeared, leaving him in no doubt\nthat it was the One Ring.\n"

Fëanor, upon learning of his father's murder and the theft of\nhis prized Silmarils, named Melkor “Morgoth”, or “Black Foe of the\nWorld” (literally “Black Enemy”). Now King of the Ñoldor, Fëanor\ndelivered the most impassioned speech ever given in Arda, which he\nunwittingly filled with Morgoth's taint. He railed against the Great\nEnemy, but because of Morgoth's influence, he also blamed the Valar for\nMorgoth's deeds. He persuaded most his people that because the Valar had\nabandoned them, the Ñoldor must follow him to Middle-earth and fight\nMorgoth. Fëanor then swore the terrible Oath of Fëanor which all seven\nof his sons also proclaimed, vowing to fight anyone and everyone —\nwhether Elf, Man, Maia, or Valar — who withheld the Silmarils, and\ninvoking even Ilúvatar as a witness. This became known as the Oath of\nFëanor and later the cause for great tragedy among his seven sons.\n\nSeeking a way to get to Middle-earth, he went to the shores of Aman,\nwhere the seafaring Teleri lived, and demanded the use of their ships.\nThe Teleri refused, and in response, Fëanor and his armed and\nimpassioned Ñoldor attacked the lightly-armed Teleri, destroyed their\nsettlements and seized the ships. This act is known as the First\nKinslaying.\n\nIn repentance of this act, Finarfin, Finwë's third son, took his host\nand turned back. They were accepted by the Valar, and Finarfin ruled as\nHigh-King of the Noldor in Valinor.\n\nThere were not enough ships to carry all of the Ñoldor across the sea,\nso Fëanor and his sons led the first group. Upon arriving at Losgar, in\nthe land of Lamoth, in the far west of Beleriand, where and\nUngoliant had passed not long before, they decided to burn the ships and\nleave the followers of Fingolfin behind. However, Fëanor accidentally\nleft his son Amras in the ships, and he was burned alive. The earth\nbeing flat in those days, the remaining Ñoldor saw the flames, and\nperceived that if they were to go to Middle-earth[[, they had no choice\nbut to cross the [[Helcaraxë. This they did under the leadership of\nFingolfin, and suffered great losses along the way, which greatly added\nto the animosity they had for Fëanor and his sons.\n\nLearning of the Ñoldor's arrival, Morgoth summoned his armies from his\nfortress of Angband and attacked Fëanor's encampment in Mithrim. This\nbattle was called the Battle under the Stars, or _Dagor-nuin-Giliath_,\nfor the Sun and Moon had not yet been made. The Ñoldor managed to win\nthe battle, and disperse Morgoth's armies. Fëanor, still in a great\nrage, pressed on toward Angband with his sons. He came even within sight\nof Angband, but was ambushed by a force of Balrogs, with few elves about\nhim. He fought mightily, hewing even after receiving several wounds from\nGothmog, captain of the Balrogs. His sons came upon the Balrogs with\ngreat force of elves, and were able to drive them off. However, as\nFëanor was being escorted off the battlefield, he knew his wounds were\nmortal. He cursed Angband thrice, but with the eyes of death, he knew\nthat his elves, unaided, would never throw down the dark towers. At the\nmoment of his death the passing of his fiery spirit reduced his body to\nashes.\n\nHis sons were still bound by the Oath to recover the Silmarils, which\nwould determine the events of Middle-earth during the First Age."

Later, Eru\nset it (or an aspect of it) at the Heart of Arda.\n\nThe Secret Fire was also described as being part of all Fëa, the soul of\na living being or the spirit: it was that Gift which makes sentient\nbeings capable of independent thought and will.\n\nIn _The Fellowship of the Ring_, Gandalf the Grey referred to both the\nSecret Fire and the Flame of Anor at the Bridge of Khazad-dum when\nconfronting the Balrog:\n\n_Anor_ was a name for the Sun in the mythology, as well as a name for\nthe _True West_ (i.e. Valinor). Further, some have speculated that\nGandalf said “flame of Anor” in reference to the fact that he wielded\none of the Three Rings of Power, Narya. Thus it is uncertain if the\n_flame of Anor_ was identical to the _Secret Fire_, but both it and _The\nSecret Fire_ identified Gandalf as a servant of the Valar."

In the world of Arda, named towers were prominent, symbolic, and\nsometimes held great character.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the Two Trees\n\nWhilst dwelling on the island of Almaren, the two most prominent towers\nin all of Arda were Helcar and Ringol which held the great lamps of\nIlluin and Ormal that lit the world in its youth. They both were thrown\ndown and destroyed by Melkor, causing a great change to the world.\n\nBefore the Sun and Moon\n\nSuccessfully reaching Aman, the Elves built Tirion where stood the\nMindon Eldaliéva, which dominated the city and symbolized elven glory in\nthe far West.\n\nFirst Age\n\nWhen the Noldor returned to Middle-earth in pursuit of Morgoth, many\ntowers were built for the observation of the enemy in the North. The\ntallest and most prominent being Minas Tirth built by Finrod to watch\nthe northern plain of Ard-galen, until it was conquered by Sauron.\n\nSecond Age\n\nEarly\n\nAs the Beleriand and its great civilizations were destroyed at the end\nof the First Age, the only great towers in Arda were located in Eldamar\nand Númenor. The elves of Tol Eressëa built a great tower in the eastern\npart of the island used for observing the sea. Men of Numenor yearning\nfor the west could see its lights from both the haven of Andúnië and\nfrom the decks of their great ships.\n\nLater\n\nAfter Numenor's destruction and the removal of Aman from the circles of\nthe world, the surviving Dúnedain of the Realms in Exile built towers of\ntheir own most of which held a Palantír, which they used to order their\nkingdoms and to communicate with each other during times of strife. In\nthe northwest lied the white towers of Arnor. Elostirion, built by\nGil-galad in honor of Elendil was its tallest and most prominent.\nNortheast of it was the tower of Annúminas in the capital, and further\nto the southeast was the tower of Amon Sûl on Weathertop.\n\nIn far southeast of Amon Sûl was the tower Orthanc in Isengard or\nAngrenost which in those days belonged exclusively to Gondor. Then,\nthere were the great towers of Gondor proper in Minas Anor, Osgiliath,\nand Minas Ithil all of which held one of the seeing stones in those\ndays.\n\nThird Age\n\nDuring the turbulent times that came with the Third Age, many of the\ngreat towers of the Dúnedain were destroyed, abandoned or occupied by\nthe enemy. Of the most infamous were Orthanc, the Tower of Cirith Ungol,\nand the Towers of the Teeth some of which were originally built by the\nDúnedain after the war of the Last Alliance to keep watch on Mordor, but\nwere abandoned and left behind due to the waning of the kingdoms of men\nand the Great Plague. Orthanc was occupied by Saruman and soon became a\nplace of evil rivaling Sauron. Only the Tower of Ecthelion remained good\nand was seen as a symbol of hope.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring and the restoration of the great kingdoms of\nmen and that of peace, the great towers of the enemy fell and were\ndestroyed. Orthanc still stood and was for a time ruled by Treebeard\nuntil he gave it up. Barad-dûr, the ultimate stronghold of the Dark Lord\nSauron, had been the highest tower in all Middle-earth during this age.\n\nFourth Age and Beyond\n\nOrthanc remained into King Elessar's time, and was found to contain many\nof his ancestor's heirlooms and treasures hoarded up and hidden by\nSaruman. It is unknown whether new towers were erected by the men of the\nReunited Kingdom.\n\n\nNote\n\n“The Two Towers” could refer to any two of the following towers:\n\n-   Orthanc\n-   Minas Tirith\n-   Minas Morgul\n-   Barad-dûr"

    "text": "THE WOLD also known as the WOLD OF ROHAN or WOLD were the upland\ngrasslands of Rohan.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThis was the northeastern area of Rohan. It was located between Fangorn\nForest and River Anduin. To the north lay\nriver Limlight and in the south by the East Emnet. The area was\nvirtually treeless and somewhat bleak and was comparable to the adjacent\nBrown Lands to the east.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the distant past - perhaps up to the mid-Second Age, the Wold was\nonce well suited to the cultivation of crops and probably had many trees\n(judging by its name), but during the War of the Elves and Sauron,\nSauron invaded the rest of Middle-earth and left lands like the Wold in\nruins.\n\n\n\nMany important battles happened in the Wold:\n\n-   When Eorl the Young arrived in Calenardhon he destroyed a host of\n    orcs there.\n-   In the year TA 2545 Eorl the Young was killed in the Wold in a\n    battle against the Easterlings.\n\nSignificance in The Lord of the Rings\n\nIn The Two Towers, this is where Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas meet Éomer\nand are given the horses Arod and Hasufel. During the War of the Ring,\nan army of orcs from Dol Guldur unsuccessful in their invasion of Lórien\nwere surprised by an attack of Ents led by Treebeard in the Wold, and\nwere defeated.\n\n\nMiscellaneous Information\n\nThe name Wold likely derives from the Anglian Old English “wold” meaning\nforest or woodland (compare to the West Saxon “weald” and German “Wald,”\nfor example). Since the region was originally heavily forested but\nbecame bleak and treeless after Sauron ravaged it, a similarity may be\ndrawn between the Wold of Rohan and the Weald of Southeastern England.\nThis region was once covered by woodland; over centuries, however, local\nindustry, especially iron production, led to deforestation. The\netymological relation, as well as the historical similarity (especially\nwhen considering Sauron's fondness of destructive industrialization and\nTolkien's personal dislike of such), indicate that the name Wold is\nlikely an intentional play on words on Tolkien's part, similar perhaps\nto possibly intentional use of Atalantë (Atlantis) for Numenor."

    "title": "Oath of Fëanor",
    "page_id": "4267",
    "text": "The OATH OF FËANOR was an oath taken by Fëanor and his seven sons to\nnon-negotiable enmity against any person who would take a Silmaril or\nkeep it from them. After Morgoth killed Finwe and stole the Silmarilli,\nthis oath became the cause of some of the most terrible and tragic\ncrimes in the history of Arda.\n\n\nHistory\n\nLearning of his father's death at the hands of Morgoth, Fëanor went back\nto Tirion, breaking the exile set by the Valar. At Tirion, Fëanor gave\nan impassioned speech in which he convinced the vast majority of the\nÑoldor to follow him to Middle-earth to wrest the Silmarils back from\nMorgoth and avenge Finwë. At the end of his speech, furious and ever\nprideful, Fëanor swore the dreadful oath to Eru, calling Manwë and Varda\nin witness. This oath saw him pledge, on pain of calling upon himself\nthe Everlasting Darkness, to pursue with violence any who would keep or\nhold a Silmaril from him, no matter who it was, and no matter what the\nreason or circumstance. His seven sons leaped to his side and swore the\noath with him. \n\nFëanor died soon after his return to Middle-Earth but the remaining\noath-takers, his sons, lived on in relative harmony with the Eldar of\nBeleriand, in no small part thanks to the diplomatic skill of Maedhros.\n For the greater part of the First Age, the oath kept the sons of\nFëanor united in one cause: to defeat Morgoth and retrieve the\nSilmarils, for so long as the jewels remained in the hands of the Dark\nLord, they were irretrievable by force. And so the oath slumbered, as by\nfighting Morgoth, even hopelessly, the brothers were still technically\nattempting to fulfill it.\n\nHowever, the terrible dangers of the oath became apparent when Beren and\nLúthien managed to recover one of the jewels from Morgoth. Now that\nthe jewel was no longer in Morgoth's hands, it became possible for the\nbrothers to retrieve it and genuinely fulfill the oath. Beren gave the\nSilmaril to King Thingol of Doriath who had demanded it as a bride-price\nfor his daughter, believing that Beren could not possibly retrieve one.\nWhen the sons of Fëanor learned of this, they demanded its surrender.\nHowever, Thingol was insulted by the demand and had begun to lust for\nthe Silmaril. He refused their request, and Curufin and Celegorm openly\nthreatened to destroy Doriath. This threat was the cause of considerable\nturmoil and resulted in much grief, for Maedhros was attempting at the\ntime to forge a coalition between the various Elven kingdoms to engage\nin a final, decisive strike against Morgoth's power. The threat caused\nThingol to close his borders and send no aid to the military alliance.\nThough the Elves would not have had the power in any circumstance to\noverthrow Morgoth, the loss of Thingol's aid proved detrimental to the\nalliance. After the Elven defeat during Nírnaeth Arnoediad, a series of\nunfortunate events led to the death of King Thingol and the\ndisappearance of Queen Melian, who returned to Valinor in grief. With\nher departure, the Girdle of Melian, which had protected Doriath from\nattack, faded. Beren and Lúthien's son, Dior, was crowned King of\nDoriath. He likewise refused to surrender the jewel, and the brothers\nattacked Doriath and sacked the halls of the Sindar, committing the\nsecond kin-slaying. However, the Silmaril escaped the destruction of\nDoriath and the oath drove the sons onwards. Eventually, they learned\nthat it it had come into the possession of Elwing, who dwelt near the\nmouths of Sirion. They attacked the and slaughtered the defenseless\nexiles of Gondolin and Doriath, committing the third and most terrible\nkin-slaying.\n\nBut the Silmaril escaped them again and was borne by Eärendil into the\nWest. That Silmaril was forever lost to the sons of Fëanor but two more\nremained in the crown of Morgoth. With the complete destruction of the\nElven kingdoms of Beleriand, it seemed impossible that these would ever\nsee the light of day again. However, Eärendil convinced the Valar to\ntake pity on the Elves and Edain under Morgoth's power, and initiated\nthe War of Wrath. This war saw Morgoth's power utterly overthrown, and\nthe two remaining Silmarils were wrested from him. However, most of the\nsons of Fëanor had been slain in battle, and no few of them during the\nkinslayings by their victims. The only brothers to survive the third and\nfinal kinslaying were Maedhros and Maglor. They demanded the Silmarils\nfrom Eönwë, the standard bearer of Manwë, but because of the wicked\ndeeds they had committed in the name of retrieving it, they were denied.\nBy now sick at heart of keeping the dreadful oath, neither particularly\nwanted anything more to do with the Silmarils, and Maglor openly opposed\nattempting to retrieve them. However, Maedhros convinced him to help him\nlay hands upon the jewels, claiming that because of the oath, they\nsimply had no choice. They snuck in to the camp of the victorious Host\nof the West, slew the guard around the jewels, and retrieved them. The\ncamp was roused against them, and they prepared themselves to die\ndefending their claim. But Eönwë simply permitted them to leave\nunharmed. However, due to the terrible deeds committed by the brothers\nin their retrieval of the Silmarils they found they could not handle the\nSilmarils without enduring searing pain. The two brothers parted and in\nhis anguish Maedhros threw himself and his Silmaril into a fiery chasm.\nMaglor on the other hand tossed his Silmaril into the sea and was said\nto wander the coast forever after lamenting his loss and pain.\n\n\nThe Oath\n\nThe Oath itself, as given in _Morgoth's Ring_, is as follows:\n\n “Be he foe or friend, be he foul or clean Brood of Morgoth or bright\nVala, Elda or Maia or Aftercomer, Man yet unborn upon Middle-earth,\nNeither law, nor love, nor league of swords, Dread nor danger, not Doom\nitself Shall defend him from Fëanáro, and Fëanáro’s kin, Whoso hideth or\nhoardeth, or in hand taketh, Finding keepeth or afar casteth A Silmaril.\nThis swear we all… Death we will deal him ere Day’s ending, Woe unto\nworld’s end! Our word hear thou, Eru Allfather! To the everlasting\nDarkness doom us if our deed faileth… On the holy mountain hear in\nwitness and our vow remember, Manwë and Varda!\""

His dwellings were built south by the feet of the mountains of\nValinor, upon the confines of the realm. Aulë had made Lorien's halls\nof mist gathered beyond Avathar upon the Shadowy Seas. His hall was\ngreat and dimly lit and had wide gardens which wandered marvelously\nabout, winding near to the feet of Telperion whose shining lit them. The\ngardens were full of labyrinths and mazes, for Yavanna had given Lórien\na great wealth of yew trees and cedars, and of pines that exuded drowsy\naromas in the dusk, and these hung over deep pools. Bright glowworms\ncrept about their borders and Varda had set stars within their depths\nfor the pleasure of Irmo.

There too grew the\npoppies glowing red in the dusk, and those the Valar called Fumellar;\nthe flowers of sleep. In the middle of his gardens was set a ring of\nshadowy cypress reaching high above the cauldron Silindrin where Irmo,\ngazing upon it, saw many visions of mystery pass upon its face.

In this talk, Tolkien speaks against critics\nwho play down the fantastic elements of the poem (Grendel, Grendel's\nMother, the dragon, etc.) in favor of using _Beowulf_ solely as a source\nfor Anglo-Saxon history. Tolkien argues that rather than being merely\nextraneous, these elements are key to the narrative and should be the\nfocus of study.

They captured the Black Gate but lost many as they\npassed through Udûn, a plateau north of Mordor, and they failed to break\ninto the Dark Tower. Thus, they laid siege on the Dark Tower.\n\nThe siege lasted for a total of seven years. Many elves and men were\nkilled in the siege as seemingly endless numbers of arrows, rocks,\nflaming missiles, and Orc sorties emerged from the tower. Fortunately,\nAnárion's army from Gondor managed to reinforce the Last Alliance. On\nthe sixth year of the siege, SA 3440, Anárion was hit in the head by a\nstone and died. A year later, Gil-galad and Elendil duelled Sauron on\nthe slopes of Mount Doom. Sauron, however, was much more powerful, and\nkilled first Gil-galad with the heat of his hand, and then Elendil, as\nElrond, Círdan, and Isildur helplessly watched. As Elendil fell, his\ngreat sword Narsil broke beneath him. But Sauron had been mortally\nwounded in the battle, and when Isildur cut the One Ring from Sauron's\nbody his spirit fled.\n\nAfter the battle, Sauron's body was broken, the tower of Barad-dûr\ncollapsed (without the Ring's destruction the foundations remained), and\nthe Orc hosts were in disarray. Elrond led Isildur into the heart of\nMount Doom, where the One Ring was forged, and the only place it could\nbe destroyed. However, he claimed it for his own, which led to his\ndeath.\n\nGondor later reoccupied Minas Ithil and Ithilien, and set watchtowers at\nthe Black Gate, and the pass of Cirith Ungol. However, years of neglect,\nand the Kin-strife led these areas to be captured by the Nazgûl, with\nMinas Ithil, later Minas Morgul, falling to the Witch-king.\n\nIsildur's father, brother, and Gil-galad were killed in the Siege of\nBarad-dûr."

A small\nstream ran down through The Narrows of Helm's Deep and into the caves\nand was its source of water. Gimli's poetic description of the caves to\nLegolas in _The Two Towers_ is considered by some to be Tolkien's most\nbeautiful writing in the trilogy. According to the _The Atlas of\nMiddle-earth_, it extended some 4,000 feet into the mountain.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the War of the Ring\n\nGlittering Caves was one of the two fortresses built by Númenóreans to\nguard the Fords of Isen, Angrenost (later Isengard) being the other.\nLike Angrenost to the north it was initially well - guarded, but as the\npopulation of Calenardhon (the later Rohan) dwindled it was increasingly\nless supplied and deemed unimportant, until it was only ruled by a\nhereditary small guard who intermarried much with Dunlendings.\n\nWhen Cirion, Steward of Gondor, gave Calenardhon to the Éothéod, the\nGlittering Caves was transferred to the Rohirrim who used it for refuge\nduring war, strife, and the storage of provisions, but guard duty of the\nFords was initially shared between Gondor and Rohan. The fortress then\nunderwent repair with help from the masons of Gondor. The Gondor guard\nwas merged with that of Angrenost to the north, which remained in the\nkeep of Gondor. The shared garrisoning of the fortress continued for a\ntime until soon it was solely part of Rohan and maintained only by the\nRohirrim.\n\nDuring the reign of Helm Hammerhand, the Dunlendings attacked from\nIsengard and across the river Isen conquering parts of Rohan. Edoras was\noverran and sacked, and King Helm was forced to lead much of his people\ninto the caves where they remained during the Long Winter of TA 2758 and\nTA 2759. Because Helm always blew a great horn before riding out to\nfight the beleaguering Dunlendings, the keep was renamed HORNBURG.\n\nWar of the Ring and afterwards\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, the Hornburg was the refuge of the Rohirrim\nduring the Battle of the Hornburg after being driven back by the Host of\nSaruman. After the war, Gimli the Dwarf, who had fought mightily in\nthat battle, was allowed to settle a colony of Durin's folk there,\nleading a host of Dwarves from the Lonely Mountain and became the first\nLord of the Glittering Caves. From this stronghold, after it had been\ncarefully constructed, Gimli forged a new gate for Minas Tirith made of\nMithril and Steel. Gimli and Legolas made a pact of friendship, that\nwhen the wars of their age ended, that Gimli should walk in the deep\nwoods of Fangorn and that Legolas should behold the jeweled-splendour of\nthe Glittering Caves. The Glittering Caves lay in front of a huge and\nvery beautiful cave system which proved irresistible to him. Gimli\nbecame known as the 'Lord of the Glittering Caves', although this new\nrealm was presumably under the overlordship of Thorin Stonehelm, his\nkinsman and heir of the lordship of all Durin's Folk. The Dwarves of\nGlittering Caves restored the Hornburg following the War of the Ring,\nand it became a shared fortress between them and the Rohirrim.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Sindarin, it is called AGLAROND, which means “Caves of Glory” or\n“Caves of Light”. It comes from the words _aglar_ (“glory, light”) and\n_rond_ (“cave”). It is called GLÆMSCRAFU, the “Caves of Rodiance”,\nin Rohirric,which in actuality was an Anglo-Saxon word.\n",

They were mostly of\nStoorish blood, but with a Fallohide strain.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe family began as the OLDBUCK clan, who named themselves such\napparently after a _Bucca of the Marish_, who became the first Thain of\nthe Shire. Ten Oldbuck Thains followed, until _Gordenhad Oldbuck_, the\neleventh Thain, crossed into Buckland over the river Brandywine, passing\nthe Thainship to the Took clan.\n\nGordenhad renamed himself BRANDYBUCK, and began delving the great smials\nof Brandy Hall. Around the hill was built the village of _Bucklebury_.\n\nThe Brandybucks formed a powerful dynasty, which became mostly\nindependent of the Shire, although Buckland remained nominally a part of\nit. They were seen as 'odd folk' by the other Hobbits of the Shire\nbecause they locked their doors at night (because of the exposure to the\nOld Forest). It should also be noted that the Brandybucks were not only\nthe most wary hobbit clan, but also one of the most organized in matters\nof militia. After the Ringwraiths invaded Frodo's house in Buckland, the\nmilitia was roused with the call of “Fear, Fire, Foes, Awake!” the\nmilitia of Buckland arrived, though the Ringwraiths escaped by riding\nthrough the front barricades of Buckland. This proves that the\nBrandybucks were not idle in matters of defense, perhaps due to their\nproximity to the Old Forest, and the attack of the White Wolves over the\nfrozen Brandywine River. Two instances in which the Brandybucks were\ncapable of fending off the rare (Though Minor) dangers that threatened\nthe shire.\n\n\nMasters of Buckland\n\nThe head of the family was the _Master of Buckland_, one of the\nofficials of the Shire. Gordenhad Brandybuck founded this office. Like\nthe Thain and Warden of Westmarch, the Master had only nominal\nauthority. The authority of the Master also extended across the\nBrandywine into the Marish of the Eastfarthing, due to the close\nproximity and the amount of business between the two areas.\n\n\n“Brandybuck” as a translation\n\nIt should be noted that the name _Brandybuck_ is only a translation of\nthe original Westron BRANDAGAMBA, _Marchbuck_. In keeping with the\nconcept that _The Lord of the Rings_ was derived from the translated Red\nBook of Westmarch, Tolkien translated all its Westron words into English\n— including the names of characters.

The Tower of Ecthelion was used to bear the plain white\nstandard of the Stewards of Gondor of the City, which flew from its\npinnacle, and—at least during the last years of the Third Age. It is 50\nfathoms (300 feet) tall. The Tower stood in the center of the Citadel on\nthe seventh level of the city. In front of the Tower was the Place of\nthe Fountain where the White Tree of Gondor grew.\n\nIn the Tower Hall was the throne of the King of Gondor upon a dais, and\nat the foot the dais on the lowest step was a black chair where the\nSteward of Gondor would sit. There was a chamber high in the Tower and\nabove it in the summit there was a secret room where the Palantír of\nMinas Anor, called the _Anor-stone_, was kept.\n\nBelow the Hall was the buttery of Beregond's company, where the Citadel\nGuard (which Pippin became) would stay when not on duty.\n\n\nHistory\n\nKing Calimehtar first built the White Tower in TA 1900 in order to house\nthe Palantír. In TA 2698, the Tower was repaired and rebuilt by the\nSteward Ecthelion I, some three centuries before the War of the Ring,\nand for whom the Tower came to be named.\n\nThe elite military unit in Minas Tirith was called the Guard of the\nCitadel or the Guard of the Tower. At the time of the War of the Ring,\nBoromir and Faramir - the sons of the Steward of Gondor - each bore the\ntitle Captain of the White Tower. Boromir, the Steward's heir, was also\nthe High Warden of the White Tower.\n\nOn March 9, 3019, Peregrin Took got his first glimpse of the Tower of\nEcthelion as he rode with Gandalf to Minas Tirith:\n\n_Then Pippin cried aloud, for the Tower of Ecthelion, standing high\nwithin the topmost wall, shone out against the sky, glimmering like a\nspike of pearl and silver, tall and fair and shapely, and its pinnacle\nglittered as if it were wrought of crystals; and white banners broke and\nfluttered from the battlements in the morning breeze, and high and far\nhe heard a clear ringing as of silver trumpets._\n\n-The Return of the King: chapter 1,“Minas Tirith”\n\nPippin met Denethor II, the Steward of Gondor, in the Tower Hall.\nDenethor's son Faramir came to the Tower Hall the next day, and Pippin\nand Gandalf learned of his encounter with Frodo and Sam in Ithilien.\nWhen Faramir was brought back to the city gravely wounded on March 13,\nDenethor retreated to his chamber high in the Tower with his son and\nwould not come down. In the secret chamber of the Tower, Denethor looked\ninto the _Palantír_ and saw images manipulated by Sauron that caused him\nto despair.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring on May 1, 3019, the standard of the Stewards\nof Gondor was raised for the last time. That day Aragorn was crowned\nKing and when he entered the Citadel; the standard of the Kings of\nGondor bearing the White Tree and the Stars was unfurled on the pinnacle\nof the Tower of Ecthelion.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIt was renamed the _Tower of Ecthelion_ after the Steward Ecthelion I\nwho rebuilt it.

The phial emits a brilliant light in darkness.\n\nFor Samwise Gamgee - ''Earth from Galadriel's Orchard and a Mallorn Seed\n''- These are contained in a small box of grey wood with a silver G-rune\non the lid. He uses it to replant trees in the Shire after the Scouring\nof the Shire. In the movie, Sam instead receives Elven rope. This rope\nis much stronger than other rope. In the movie, as in the book, the rope\nallows itself to be retrieved from its anchorage with a small tug, due\nto the Elvish skill at rope-making.\n\nFor Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took - _Silver Belt with Gold\nFlower-Shaped Clasp_ - a belt favoured by the Elves of Lothlorien. In\nthe movie, Galadriel presents them with daggers. \n\nFor Aragorn - _Elven Scabbard_- A magical scabbard, any sword sheathed\nin this scabbard will never break. And _Elessar the Elfstone_ - A green\ngem set in a silver eagle shaped brooch, left for him by Arwen. In the\nmovie, Aragorn does not receive either of these, as Arwen has already\ngiven him the film's equivalent gem; Elrond will later present him a\nscabbard with Andúril, though no indication is given that it is magical.\nInstead, Celeborn gives him a curved Elvish hunting knife.\n\nFor Legolas - _Bow of the Galadhrim with\nArrows_ - A great bow crafted deep in Lothlorien and strung with\nelf-hair.\n\nFor Gimli - _Three Strands of Galadriel's hair_ - Overwhelmed by\nGaladriel's great beauty, Gimli could think of nothing else he wanted\nbut a single strand of her hair. Galadriel gave him three. Gimli wished\nto encase this gift in imperishable crystal, as an heirloom of his house\nand a sign of good will between the Dwarves and Elves.\n\nFor Boromir - A solid gold belt crafted in Lórien, shaped like linked\ngolden leaves.\n\nFor all the Fellowship of the Ring (characters) - _Elven Cloaks_ - It is\nworth note that The Fellowship received Elven cloaks from Galadriel\nwhich helped hide them from unfriendly eyes. The cloaks were personally\nwoven by Galadriel and her maidens. The brooches were in the form of a\ngreen leaf veined with silver. The only notable exception to those who\ndidn't receive a cloak was Gandalf, who at the time, was presumed dead\nat the hands of Durin's Bane. In the film, after defeating the Balrog\nand returning to the world of the living, Gandalf appears in Fangorn\nwith a brooched cloak, implying that he traveled to Lorien before\njoining up with scattered members of the Fellowship."

At this place,\nUngoliant demanded payment for helping Morgoth overthrow the Two Trees\nof Valinor and take the Silmarils. Grudgingly, Morgoth gave her all the\njewels from one hand. But he refused to hand over the Silmarils, even\nthough they burned him.\n\nBut Ungoliant, having grown to a powerful and monstrous form after\nconsuming the light of the jewels, wrathfully ensnared and attempted to\nstrangulate her master with her webs of darkness, but Morgoth sent forth\na great cry. Balrogs lurking in the vaults of Angband heard him, and\nrushed to aid him, destroying the webs with their whips of flame.\n\nUngoliant fled from the region, and made her abode in Nan Dungortheb.\nThere, she mated with the giant Spiders that dwelt in the nearby Ered\nGorgoroth, and devoured them. The resulting unions produced a massive\nbrood of half-demonic spider-like children, which infested Nan\nDungortheb, as well as the Mountains of Terror, throughout the\nsubsequent years of the First Age.\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, Ungoliant abandoned her domain, and\nwandered into the forgotten South of the world. Although it is believed\nthat she devoured herself amid her uttermost famine, her true fate\nremains unknown.\n\nThus saved, Morgoth rebuilt Angband, reared the mountains of\nThangorodrim, marshaled armies of Orcs, and set the Silmarils in an Iron\nCrown for himself.\n\nThe area of his strife with Ungoliant was hereafter known as Lammoth.\nWhenever someone shouted in that region, the cry of Morgoth was heard as\nthe echo.",

But as the Shire was a\npeaceful place, their only purpose was protecting the Shire from\ntrespassers. They were also possibly responsible for deputizing hobbits\ninto the Bounders service who patrolled the borders.\n\nWhen Lotho Sackville-Baggins ruled the Shire under Saruman during the\nWar of the Ring, he took personal control of the Shirriffs service under\nthe title “Chief Shirriff”. The Shirriffs were increased in number, many\nagainst their will, and those that already were appointed couldn't quit;\nbut some liked it or even signed up, and organized into troops or\ncompanies such as the First Eastfarthing Troop and supported by the\nRuffians. The Shirriffs were also armed far more heavily than\npreviously. Their orders during these troubled times were to arrest\nanyone who broke the rules.\n\nWhen the Shire was freed by the return of Frodo and company, the\nShirriffs were returned to their original numbers and purpose.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe term _Shirriff_ is most likely based upon “Shire Reeve”, the\nAnglo-Saxon term that eventually gave rise to the word “Sheriff” in\nmodern English. Shire being analogous to “county” and “reeve” being\nan English term for an appointed official who represents a landlord.\n\n\nKnown Shirriffs\n\n-   Tobias Hornblower\n-   Lotho Sackville-Baggins\n-   Broncho Stonecrow\n-   Robin Smallburrow"

Nonetheless, they were strong foes with\ntheir iron-hard scales, wicked claws, bold tail and terrible fangs.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThough most were wiped out during the War of Wrath at the end of the\nFirst Age, many survived in the far North above the Grey Mountains and\nin the Withered Heath. As the millennia passed, the cold-drakes\nmultiplied and became a serious threat to the Dwarves in the late\ncenturies of the Third Age. Eventually, war was declared. In TA 2589,\nDáin I, King of Durin's Folk, and his second son Fror were slain at the\ngates of their own hall by a gigantic cold-drake. With the ongoing\nattacks of these fierce creatures, the majority of the Dwarves decide to\nmigrate eastwards from the Grey Mountains. Soon afterwards, the Iron\nHills and the Lonely Mountain became the major dwellings of the\nLongbeards (the inhabitants of Khazad-dûm). Tolkien gives no hint to the\nhistory of the cold-drakes after this time period.\n\nFour hundred years later, at the time of Bilbo Baggins' journey to\nErebor, they seem to have left the Grey Mountains (as implied by Gandalf\nmaking no mention of them when describing the dangers of that region).\n\n\nSpeculations\n\n-   Some of theories for origin(s) of dragons claim that morphology of\n    cold-drakes may be similar to that of 'dragons' before dragons.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   They may have been animals originally created by Yavanna (and\n    therefore the first dragons) that were then used by Morgoth to breed\n    the much stronger and more wicked Uruloki.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Land-crawling dragons are sometimes considered physically more\n    powerful than their flying kin by some fans. Some of cold-drakes\n    whose fire-breathing ability did not degenerate as much as 'true'\n    ones, could possibly use breaths of vapor mist or smoke, and magical\n    arts such as “death glance” utilized by Gostir (a speculation from\n    the drake's name etymology).\n\n&nbsp;\n-   What caused cold-drakes to lose the ability to breath fire is\n    unclear. It might have been due to unnecessary to inherit such means\n    of destruction to consume lots of energy after being freed from\n    restraints under Morgoth's rule, or to hide them from Valar and High\n    Elves after surviving War of Wrath. Selection of capabilities to\n    survive is a common phenomenon among real organisms.\n\nde:Kaltdrachen ru:Холодные драконы"

    "text": "The DAGOR DAGORATH or “FINAL BATTLE” is the end-times event described\nand alluded to in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. The published\n_Silmarillion_ ends with the recounting of the voyage of Eärendil the\nMariner, but this is due to an editorial decision by Christopher\nTolkien. The _Silmarillion_ as Tolkien originally wrote it ends with a\nprophecy by Mandos about the Dagor Dagorath, often referred to as “THE\nEND”. The remaining clue to this prophecy is found at the end of\nAkallabêth, where \"Ar-Pharazôn and his mortal warriors who had set foot\nin Aman were buried by falling hills, imprisoned in the Caves of the\nForgotten until the “LAST BATTLE AND DAY OF DOOM”. The account is\nclearly inspired by and bears many similarities to the Norse legend of\nRagnarök, but also that of the Biblical Armageddon. It is important to\nnote that the final, published version of the ''Silmarillion ''contains\nno direct references to this prophecy (though there are still indirect\nreferences including the 'Last Battle', 'Day of Doom' and 'end of\ndays'.\n\nTom Bombadil once referred to this future time as when “the world is\nmended”, in a song.\n\nDoom of Melkor\n\nIn later writings of Tolkien's, it becomes apparent that Melkor was not\nmerely bound, but unhoused, after his final capture, being “beheaded”\nand thus “killed”; that is, the body to which he had become so bound\ntowards was destroyed, after which execution his spirit, still bound\nwith the enchanted chain Angainor, was cast out through the Door of\nNight. His “will” is spoken of as an active force in the world, tempting\nand urging in thought, and sometimes in phantom manifestation.\n\nThe Second Prophecy of Mandos\n\n“Thus spoke Mandos in prophecy, when the Valar sat in judgement in\nValinor and the rumour of his word was whispered among all the Elves of\nthe West. When the world is old and the Powers have grown weary,\nMorgoth, the Black Foe of the World, seeing that the guard sleepeth,\nshall come back through the Door of the Night out of the Timeless Void;\nand all shall be darkness, for the sun he will turn to black, and the\nmoon will no longer shed his light.. But the Host of Valinor shall\ndescend upon him as a searing flame, white and terrible. Then shall the\nLast Battle be gathered on the fields of Valinor. In that day, Tulkas\nshall strive with Morgoth, and on his right hand shall be Eönwë, and on\nhis left Túrin Turambar, son of Húrin, returning from the Doom of Men at\nthe ending of the world; and the black sword of Túrin shall deal unto\nMorgoth his death and final end; and so shall the Children of Húrin and\nall fallen Men be avenged.”\n\n“Thereafter shall the Earth be broken and remade, and the Silmarils\nshall be recovered out of Air and Earth and Sea; for Feanor shall\nsurrender them willingly Yavanna will rekindle the Two Trees, and a\ngreat light shall come forth. And the mountains of Valinor shall be\nlevelled, so that the light shall go out over all the world. In that\nlight the Valar will grow young again, and the Elves awake and all their\ndead arise, and the purpose of Ilúvatar be fulfilled concerning them.\nBut of Men in that day the prophecy of Mandos doth not speak, and no Man\nit names, save Túrin only, and to him a place is given among the sons of\nthe Valar.” - The Later Quenta Silmarillion (History of Middle-earth,\nvolume 11).\n\nBattle\n\nAccording to the prophecy, Morgoth will discover how to break the Door\nof Night, and will blacken the Sun and the Moon. For the love of these,\nEärendil will return from the sky and shall meet Tulkas, Manwë, Eönwë\n(with the old version of his name Fionwe) and Túrin Turambar on the\nplains of Valinor.  There the\nforces of the Valar shall fight against Melkor and The Dark Powers.\nTulkas will wrestle with Morgoth, but it will be by the hand of Túrin\nthat finally death and destruction will be dealt to Melkor. Túrin will\nrun his black sword Gurthang (Iron of Death) through Melkor's heart,\nthus avenging the Children of Húrin (Sindarin: _Hîn Húrin_) and all the\nfallen (In the end of _The Hiding of Valinor_ Eönwë, and not Turin,\nkills Morgoth). Then the three Silmarils will be recovered from the\nEarth, sea, and sky, then Fëanor taking them and will break, and with\ntheir fire Yavanna will rekindle the Two Trees, and a great light shall\ncome forth, and Pelóri Mountains will be leveled. The battle will end\nand renew Arda's existence: all the Elves will awaken and the Powers\nwill be young again.\n\nFollowing this, there will be a Second Music of the Ainur. This song\nwill sing into being a new world. Men and Elves will sing it with the\nAinur. It is unknown what the fate of the old races, or of the old\nworld, will be in the new one. However, It is worth noting that the\nDwarves believe that after the greatest battle of all time, they will\nhelp the Vala, Mahal, rebuild Arda. For though Mandos prophesied it,\neven the Ainur do not know anything of the second world or the Second\nMusic. All the Ainur know is that the Second Music will be greater than\nthe First Music.\n\n\nNotes\n\nChristopher Tolkien removed the prophecy from _The Silmarillion_ based\non a 1958 version of the Valaquenta, wherein his father wrote that none\nof Mandos' dooms had declared whether the Marring of Arda would ever be\nrepaired (Christopher Tolkien adopted this passage and used it to close\nthe Quenta Silmarillion). Given this removal of the prophecy Christopher\napparently assumed that the Dagor Dagorath had been removed as well.\n\nThe published _Silmarillion_ contradicts the Second Prophecy in places.\nWhereas the Second Prophecy explicitly states that the Elves and Valar\nshall be renewed after Dagor Dagorath and that the fate of Men is\nunknown, _The Silmarillion_ states that Men will participate in singing\nthe Second Music, and that it is the fate of the Elves that is unknown.\n\nIn all of this the Creator, Eru, will retain His sovereignty and nothing\nMorgoth nor any evil force could do will be able to threaten his plan in\nany way. As Eru said, “And thou, Melkor, shalt see that no theme may be\nplayed that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the\nmusic in my despite. For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine\ninstrument in the devising of things more wonderful, which he himself\nhath not imagined.”\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Dagor Dagorath_ was Sindarin for “Battle of Battles”.",

    "text": "“FIRE-DRAKES” (or URULÓKI) was one term used for fire-breathing DRAGONS.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFirst Age\n\n\n\nGlaurung and Ancalagon were fire-drakes, and were among the most famous\nof the breed. Glaurung was a key player in the sacking of Nargothrond\nand in the fulfillment of Morgoth's curse on the children of Húrin. He\nwas a fearsome bane to the Elves. Ancalagon and his armada of winged\nfire-drakes by themselves drove back the Host of the Valar during the\nWar of Wrath at the end of the First Age, such was their incredible\npower.\n\nFire-drakes also joined the Balrogs in the attack on Gondolin.\n\nSecond and Third Ages\n\n\n\nAll fire-drakes were thought to have been slain before the Second Age,\nbut some including Smaug the Golden survived; and in TA 2770,he\ndescended from the North and sacked the Lonely Mountain. Later, in TA\n2941 Thrór's grandson Thorin Oakenshield returned with a small group to\nreclaim his grandfather's kingdom, unleashing a chain of events that led\nto the death of Smaug when he attacked nearby Lake-town and was slain by\nthe Black Arrow shot by Bard the Bowman.\n\nAccording to Gandalf, there were still fire-drakes just before the\nbeginning of War of the Ring.\n\n\nAttributes\n\nThese creatures are described by Tolkien as being more like giant scaled\nserpents with wings than dragons as commonly depicted today. Fire-drakes\noften grew to immense size. The fire from one of these dragons was so\nintense that it was said the great dragons could consume and melt the\nRings of Power (as became the case with some of hte Dwarven Rings), with\nthe exception of the One Ring. Most of the famous dragons throughout\nthe ages were fire-drakes, although only some of them fought for\nMorgoth.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Quenya, fire-drakes were called _URULÓKI_ (“Fire Serpent” or\n“Fire-dragon”), from _ur_ (“heat”) and _lókë_ (“snake,\nserpent”).\n\n\nKnown Individuals\n\n\n\nFew fire-drakes were named in J.R.R.

    "text": "'''Dwarf Runes '''(one technical term is “THE\nANGERTHAS”) were a runic script used by the Dwarves, and was their main\nwriting system. This Dwarven writing system utilizes runes and glyphs\nwhen written. \n\nDwarf Runes were first created by the elven loremaster Daeron of Doriath\nand were called Cirth or Certar Daeron. Daeron was inspired by the\nTengwar script of Fëanor and wanted to create a new script for his\nSindar kin. The dwarves learned the runes from the elves and adapted\nthem for their own language Khuzdûl. The letters are thin and angular\nfor they were designed for cutting or scratching on wood, stone, or\nmetal. By the Third Age only the dwarves made regular use of them. The\nCirth alphabet originally had nineteen characters which was sufficient\nfor the Sindarin language. More were later added by the Noldor of\nEregion to make it easier to express certain subtle sounds in their\nlanguage. This full expansion of the script is generally called\nAngerthas Daeron or Angerthas Eregion. After the destruction of Eregion\nthe elves generally ceased to use Cirth at all. Dwarves made their own\nvariations of the script called Angerthas Moria and Angerthas Erebor.\n\nSome dwarves knew a secret way of writing runes called Moon letters.\nThese runes were written with a silver pen and could only be seen under\nthe light of the moon. With the more advanced forms of Moon letters it\nhad to be a moon of the same shape and season as the day when the runes\nwere written.\n\nThe runes of the dwarves were adapted by Tolkien from the Anglo-Saxon\nand Scandinavian rune scripts.\n\n\n\nKhuzdul.gif|This is the Angerthas Moria, There are 4 characters that do\nnot appear in this chart, the characters for TH, another for E, the\ncharacter for NG, and the character for OO Runes.JPG"

It tells the story of the love of the mortal man, Aragorn\nand the immortal Elf Maiden, Arwen.\n\nThe tale was written by Faramir's grandson Barahir after Aragorn's\ndeath.\n\n\nThe Tale\n\nAfter his father was killed battling Orcs, Aragorn was sent to live in\nRivendell with his mother, Gilraen. Around his twentieth year, as he\nwalked in the woods singing a part of the Lay of Lúthien, he witnessed\nthe beauty of Arwen for the first time, clad in a mantle of silver and\nblue. Mistaking her for Lúthien, he called to her by that name, and,\nfrom that moment on, loved only her. Gilraen warned Aragorn of the folly\nof his love for Arwen, a high-born Elf such as she was. Aragorn soon\nleft Rivendell, and for thirty years fought against Sauron on whatever\nfront which was deemed necessary.\n\nIn his forty-ninth year of life, after years of strife and toil, he\nwished, once again, to be at peace. He came into Lórien, not knowing\nthat Arwen also was there, and stayed with her for a season. “And thus\nit was that Arwen first beheld him again after their long parting; and\nas he came walking towards her under the trees of Caras Galadhon laden\nwith flowers of gold, her choice was made and her doom appointed.” On\nCerin Amroth, in the midst of Lórien they plighted their troth looking\ntoward the shadow of the east and the twilight of the west.\n\nAfter The War of the Ring, Arwen and Aragorn were married and spent\nsix-score years in bliss. As Aragorn felt his life drawing to a close,\nhe came to Arwen, saying, “In sorrow we must go, but not in despair.\nBehold! we are not bound for ever to the circles of the world, and\nbeyond them is more than memory.”\n\nAfter he passed from the world in the House of the Kings, she bid\nfarewell to Eldarion and her daughters, and went out of Minas Tirith to\nLórien and, “dwelt there alone under the fading trees until winter\ncame.” Sometime before the Spring she laid herself down upon Cerin\nAmroth, and there she would lie until the world's ending."

However, after an hour had long past, Frodo had still\nnot returned. Boromir, who had earlier abandoned the remaining members\nof the Fellowship without their knowing, then returned. He recounted\nthat he had seen Frodo an hour before, that he had tried to convince\nFrodo to bring the Ring to Minas Tirith, and that they then had an\nargument, resulting in Frodo putting on the Ring and vanishing. This\nstory roused the suspicions of Aragorn, who guessed correctly that\nBoromir had not told the entire truth. At the conclusion of Boromir's\nstory, Merry and Pippin immediately ran off to locate Frodo while\nLegolas and Gimli searched for the Ring-bearer in a different direction.\n\nFearing that the Fellowship would be scattered and lost, Aragorn\ncommanded Boromir to follow Merry and Pippin.

It flowed\nthrough the Ettenmoors and then curved southward, skirting the western\nedge of the Trollshaws. Running under the Last Bridge on the\nEast-West Road, it went on southward until it was joined by the River\nBruinen or 'Loudwater'.

Beyond this point the combined waters were named Gwathlo.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Hoarwell was within the boundaries of Arnor when the realm was\nfounded. In TA 861 when Arnor was dismembered, the river was within the\nconfines of Rhudaur.\n\nSometime around TA 1150, the Stoors came over the Redhorn Pass and\nsettled in the Angle, the land between the Hoarwell and the Loudwater.\nWhen Angmar became powerful around TA 1300, these Hobbits moved over the\nHoarwell to dwell near Bree. \n\nIn May TA 2941, Thorin and Company crossed the river on the Last Bridge\nand later on that same day they were waylaid by three trolls - Tom, Bert\nand William.

Tolkien used the term\n_goblin_ extensively in _The Hobbit_, and also occasionally in _The Lord\nof the Rings,_ as when the Uruk-hai of Isengard are first described:\n“four goblin-soldiers of greater stature”.\n\nA clear illustration that Tolkien considered goblins and orcs to be the\nsame thing, the former word merely being the English translation of the\nlatter, is that in _The Hobbit_ (the only one of Tolkien's works in\nwhich he usually refers to orcs as _goblins_) Gandalf asks Thorin if he\nremembers Azog the goblin who killed his grandfather Thror , while in\nall his other writings Tolkien describes Azog as a “great Orc”.\n\n\nHistory and Description\n\n\n\nWhen Melkor was taken in chains to Valinor, the Orcs and other foul\ncreatures were forced to flee from Angband. Their kingdoms spread\nthroughout many mountains of Middle-earth; notable cities include\nGoblin-town near the High Pass above Rivendell, the Goblin-capital at\nMount Gundabad, and the former Dwarf-kingdom of Moria, as well as those\nin the service of Isengard and Mordor.\n\n\nTechnology\n\nEven though goblins are portrayed as a very barbaric and tribal race\ntheir technology seems to be more advanced than other races in middle\nearth. In _The Hobbit_, Tolkien describes goblins as having dark\ntechnology. In the chapter “Over Hill and Under Hill” Tolkien states,\n“It is not unlikely that they invented some of the machines that have\nsince troubled the world, especially the ingenious devices for killing\nlarge numbers of people at once, for wheels and engines and explosives\nalways delighted them.”\n\n\nWeapons and armor\n\n\n\nGoblin weapons include scimitars, axes, and spears, as well as bows. The\ngreat goblin-soldiers of Isengard, the “fighting Uruk-hai”, are\ndistinguished by their use of short, straight swords and long bows of\nyew.\n"

Bag End, the home of Bilbo Baggins and later\nSackville-Bagginses and then Sam Gamgee, could be called a Smial, as it\nwas an expansive Hobbit-hole with many windows; a large circular green\nfront and back door, and a large number of rooms; as well as the\nfamously renowned pantries which supplied food for many a party or\ncelebration.\n\nOn the other hand, the poor lived in basic burrows with perhaps only a\nsingle window. An example of this is Bagshot Row. The famous Took family\nlived in the Great Smials, their ancestral home, and many-tunneled\nmansion.\n\nDuring the Scouring of the Shire, many Hobbit-holes were destroyed and\nreplaced with wooden shacks, towards the end of the Third Age.\n\nde:Smials",

Tolkien.\n\n\nIn Middle-earth\n\nDwarves\n\nOnly seen by some of the members of Thorin and Company, in _The Hobbit._\n\nElves\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Elven archers from Lórien use large bows of Mallorn wood strung with\nelf-hair. Their arrows were almost four feet long and usually made of\nash with a tip made of gold and shaped like a Mallorn leaf. They used a\nspiral method of fletching (attaching feathers to the arrow shaft), thus\nmaking their arrows more accurate, up to a quarter mile.\n\nLegolas was the most renowned archer throughout the Third Age. Earlier\nin his journey with the Fellowship of the Ring, he used a bow from\nMirkwood, and it was later replaced by the bow of the Galadhrim Lady\nGaladriel gave him.\n\nGondorian\n\n\n\nThe Gondorian army contains units of archers who use a longbow. The bows\nare made of heartwood, about 68 inches tall. The arrows are about 28\ninches long with four-inch steel tips. They are accurate up to 200\nyards. The longbowmen of the army wear their quiver (the case that holds\nthe arrows) on their hips rather than on their backs like most archers,\nsuch as Legolas and Haldir.\n\nRangers of Ithilien\n\nThe Rangers of Ithilien were primarily archers. They used a simple\nlongbow, often made of yew, likely up to 80 inches in length. Their\narrows would have averaged about 28 inches in length with a steel tip\nwith consistent accuracy up to 200 yards.\n\nRohirrim\n\nRohan included archers in its militia. They used shortbows, possibly\nbecause they fought mounted on horses and a longer bow might get in the\nway. The shortbows were much less powerful than those used by their\nallies, having probably a range of only 125 yards. Their arrows were\nunique in having a cutout in the heads; this cut down on weight & the\namount of metal used while still allowing the arrowheads to have a\nlarger surface area, which would cause a larger wound. Another unique\naspect of the arrows was that they were fletched with leather.\n\n_Note: Information comes from “The Lord of the Rings: Weapons and\nWarfare” by Chris Smith._\n\nHaradrim and Easterlings\n\n\n\nThe Haradrim (Southrons) were also skilled archers, along with their\nallies the Easterlings. The Haradrim were masters of archery and had\nexpert snipers positioned on the feared Mumakil. Their bows were short,\npossibly made of composite materials and by the time of the War of the\nRing, could possibly have been compound, making them extremely deadly.\nThe Easterlings are mentioned several times in the books as having\nscores of mounted archers. The horse archers were among the deadliest in\nMiddle Earth, far exceeding the skill of the Rohirrim and Haradrim. The\nEasterlings also had many foot archers weilding both longbows and\nrecurve bows.\n\nOrcs\n\n\n\nOrcs and Goblins were often seen carrying bows, but are also viewed as\npoor handlers of the weapon. Their bows can range from being as tall as\nan Uruk to relatively short. The maximum effective ranges included 50\nand 100 yards. Orc arrows were usually tipped with poison or barbed, so\neven a glancing hit could be fatal.\n\nHobbits\n\nThe Hobbits were not a warring people, but their best unit in times of\nwar are their archers. During the reign of the last King of Arnor before\nits dispansion the first time, hobbits sent archers to his aid as was\nagreed when they moved to live in Arnor. Hobbit archers were also\nresponsible for the death of Grima Wormtongue.﻿\n\n\nMost notable archers\n\n-   Beleg\n-   Legolas\n-   Bard \n"

Indeed, after many years of labor, Gondolin did come to\nrival Tirion with its beauty and splendor. As mentioned above, Tumladen\nand the city it held, Gondolin, survived for more than 503 years, the\nlongest lasting of the Ñoldorin kingdoms. The vale was betrayed, as\nmentioned above, by Maeglin and in so doing, Maeglin finally destroyed\nthe last kingdom of the Ñoldor in Beleriand. It was there that the\nbattle of Ecthelion of the Fountain and Gothmog, the Lord of Balrogs,\ntook place in the very square of the King. There it was also that they\nslew each other, and in so doing, Ecthelion had felled the mightiest of\nBalrogs, even though he himself had died also. And so, with the\ntreachery of Maeglin, the fair vale of Tumladen and the city upon Amon\nGwareth, Gondolin, the last kingdom of the Ñoldor, were destroyed and\nruined.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Tumladen_ is a name coming from two Sindarin roots. One of the roots is\n_tum_ (pronounced _toom_), which means a valley. The other Sindarin root\nis _lad_, which means a plain or a valley. Both parts of this name\ndoubly imply and tell that Tumladen is a plain/valley, a very\ninteresting combination of Sindarin roots on the part of Tolkien.\n\n\nOther\n\nIn the Third Age, Tumladen was a valley near the southeastern end of the\nWhite Mountains. When Pippin arrived in Minas Tirith, he saw vehicles\ncarrying the old, the children and the women to take refuge in Lebennin\nthrough the vales Tumladen, Lossarnach, and the mountain-villages.\nTumladen was placed at the source of River Sirith in _The Atlas of\nMiddle-earth_."

A pavilion was erected around the Party Tree and stood at the\nhead of the main table during Bilbo's Farewell Birthday Party and\nlanterns were hung in its branches. Bilbo Baggins made one of his\nrenowned long speeches under this tree upon his leaving of the Shire.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, Sam Gamgee returned to the Shire in November\n3019 to find the tree had been felled by Saruman's orders and abandoned\nin the middle of the field. The tree was removed after the Scouring of\nthe Shire, and in place of the original tree, Sam planted a silver\nnut given to him by the Lady Galadriel.

    "text": "The COUNCIL OF ELROND was the secret council called by Elrond in\nRivendell in order to decide what should be done with the One\nRing, during the Great Years in the Third Age.\n\nThose present at this council were people who were of the three largest\nraces of good in Middle-earth: Men, Elves, and Dwarves.\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nDuring the Council, the full story of the Ring was told by Bilbo and\nGandalf. Elrond and the others agreed that this was indeed the One Ring,\nbased on evidence provided by Gandalf.\n\nGandalf related his meeting with Saruman and subsequent imprisonment by\nthe traitor in Orthanc.\n\nBoromir described the dream he and his brother Faramir had experienced,\nand which led him to come to Rivendell. He pleaded that the Ring should\nbe used to aid Gondor in her struggle against Mordor, but was told that\nit would inevitably corrupt anyone who used it. Only a mighty person\ncould hope to wield the Ring against Sauron, and they would in time\nbecome a new Dark Lord whether they wished it or not. Boromir\nreluctantly accepted this conclusion.\n\nGlóin, Gimli's father, spoke of evil messengers who had come to the\nLonely Mountain promising the return of one or more of the Seven rings\nif they would reveal the location of Bilbo Baggins. The possibility of\nwar with Sauron's allies in the region was troubling, but Gandalf was\nrelieved that at least Smaug the dragon was no longer around for the\nDark Lord to use. They had also came seeking news of what happened to\nBalin, who went to Moria in TA 2989 with Ori and Óin.\n\n\n\nLegolas conveyed the bad news that Gollum had escaped captivity and\ndisappeared. Aragorn had gone to great lengths to capture the debased\ncreature, who had possessed the Ring for centuries under the Misty\nMountains. After his capture, Aragorn and Gandalf had interrogated the\nmiserable Gollum, and found to their dismay that he had been to Mordor.\nApparently, while under torment there, Gollum had confessed both that he\nhad held the One Ring and that Bilbo had taken it to the Shire.\n\nAfter much debate about the fate of the Ring, it was decided that the\nonly way to be free of Sauron's evil was to cast the Ring into the\nCracks of Doom in Mount Doom (in Mordor), where it would be unmade. This\nmight well undo the power of the three Elf-rings, but would certainly\nrender Sauron impotent and free Middle-earth from his menace forever.\n\nTom Bombadil was also mentioned as a possible ring bearer since the ring\ntook no effect on him, but Gandalf stated that Tom would most likely\nlose it as Tom seemed to be very nonchalant about the War of the Ring.\n\nIt then became necessary to decide who should take responsibility for\nsuch a perilous undertaking. Bilbo offered to finish the job he had\nstarted, but Gandalf told him he could not take back the Ring. Frodo\nsurprised everyone (including himself) by announcing that he would take\nthe Ring, and after some thought Elrond agreed. At this point Sam\nemerged from hiding and demanded to accompany Frodo, and since it was\nhardly possible to separate them Elrond agreed.\n\nThe matter of who else should accompany Frodo (later to be known as the\nFellowship of the Ring, hence the title of the book and subsequent\nmovie) was decided later, although the movie version of _The Fellowship\nof the Ring_ depicts the choosing of the Fellowship as taking place at\nthe end of the Council, and has Merry and Pippin also eavesdropping on\nthe proceedings and demanding to accompany Frodo.\n\n\nPresent individuals\n\nThose present at the Council had arrived at Rivendell by different paths\nand on separate errands, yet they were all ultimately concerned with the\nRing and its effect upon the people of Middle-earth. Important\nparticipants at the Council were:\n\n-   Elrond - a Half-elven conveyor, member of White Council and lord of\n    Rivendell.\n-   Erestor - an Elf-lord, advisor, and the chief of the House of\n    Elrond.\n-   Gandalf the Grey - a Wizard, one of the Istari, and member of both\n    the White Council and The Fellowship.\n-   Aragorn - a Ranger, heir of Isildur, member of The Fellowship, and\n    Chieftain of the Dúnedain in the North.\n-   Frodo Baggins - a Hobbit of the Shire, member of The Fellowship, and\n    Ring-bearer.\n-   Bilbo Baggins - a Hobbit of the Shire, former Ring-bearer, uncle of\n    Frodo and long resident in Rivendell.\n-   Boromir of Gondor - son of Denethor II Ruling Steward of Minas\n    Tirith, and member of The Fellowship.\n-   Glóin of the Lonely Mountain - representative of the King under the\n    Mountain, Dain Ironfoot of the Dwarves.\n-   Gimli - son of Gloin, member of The Fellowship, and dwarf of the\n    Lonely Mountain.\n-   Legolas - a Sindar Elf of the Woodland Realm (Mirkwood), son of\n    Thranduil the Elvenking, and member of The Fellowship.\n-   Glorfindel - an Elf-lord of Rivendell, rescuer of Frodo and his\n    company from the Nine.\n-   Galdor of the Havens - messenger from Círdan of the Grey Havens."

    "text": "_'Lake-town, OR Esgaroth_', known fully as “ESGAROTH UPON THE LONG\nLAKE”, was a small settlement and community of Men in the north-western\npart of the Long Lake in the Rhovanion. The town was constructed\nentirely of wood and stands upon wooden pillars sunk into the bed of the\nLong Lake, south of the Lonely Mountain and east of Mirkwood. It seems\nthat the town's prosperity was built on trade between the Men, Elves and\nDwarves of northern Middle-earth.\n\nIt was also known as the final resting place of the Dragon Smaug, whose\nbones ended up at the bottom of the lake, and by whom it was destroyed.\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nLake-town may have been separate settlements established on the same\nsite, one predating Smaug's destruction of Dale and the Lonely Mountain\nin TA 2770 and the other built afterwards. Uniquely, of all of the\ntowns, settlements, fortresses, and cities of Middle-earth, Lake-town\nutilized water as its defense. The Long Lake was also surrounded by\ntowering cliffs and high mountains, all helpful natural barriers that\nhad the potential to aid its defenders in a siege (such as the\nEasterling invasion of the North in TA 3018). While these defenses\nslowed and diverted Lake-town's human enemies, it did nothing to prepare\nits inhabitants against Smaug. The villagers would be harassed on a\nregular basis by Smaug. Smaug would steal an occasional maiden or just\nburn down their homes.\n\nLake-town was founded sometime during the Third Age and its inhabitants\ntraded extensively with the Elves of Thranduil's Woodland Realm, the\nDwarves of the Lonely Mountain and the Iron Hills, their kin in Dale and\nDorwinion to the south, and possibly with the Easterlings (in times of\npeace, of course). The Men of Lake-town traded with Dorwinion (a human\nrealm on the fertile coastal plain on the west shore of the Sea of Rhûn)\nin a unique way; wine barrels were floated down from Thranduil's caverns\nin Mirkwood (the Elves were known as copious wine drinkers, as found in\nthe Hobbit) along the Celduin down to Lake-town, where they were\nredirected to Dorwinion. The wine was then paid for and filled with the\nnecessary goods before being shipped back north, and the cycle of trade\nresumed once more. These barrels were also quite large, for they could\nfit a Hobbit or Dwarf (even the extremely fat Bombur).\n\n\n\nIt is also where Bilbo and the Dwarves travelled in their adventure to\nreclaim the Lonely Mountain. In the year TA 2941 of the Third Age the\ntown was attacked by the dragon, but Bard the Bowman, who had indirectly\nlearned of a weakness in Smaug's armor that had first been noticed by\nBilbo Baggins, slew the dragon. Smaug, livid\nwith bestial fury, had winged his way to the town in the dead of night\nand promptly began to immolate the wooden matchwood structures there,\nmaterials that burst into flame at the slightest provocation. Its\ninhabitants realized all too late their predicament and while some,\nincluding most of the women and children, got away safely on boats, many\nperished in the maelstrom of fire that ensued. A brave company of\nspearmen and archers attempted, in vain, to shoot down the dragon, but\nwere mostly immolated themselves. It wasn't until Bard managed to kill\nthe dragon, that the destruction finally ended. The town was wrecked by\nthe dragon, but afterwards it was rebuilt using some of the treasure\nthat Smaug had stolen, though the town's Master ran off with some of the\nGold. Part of the town's population followed Bard to resettle the\nKingdom of Dale.\n\nAs trading people, the Men of Lake-town knew the Common Speech, Westron.\nHowever, amongst themselves they spoke an ancient form of it, which was\nloosely related to but distinct from the also ancient language of the\nRohirrim. Tolkien “translated” Westron into English in his text, so to\nrepresent its ancient relative that the Rohirrim spoke he substituted\nOld English. Thus, Tolkien substituted Old Norse for the language of the\nMen of Esgaroth (in person and place names, etc.) because it is an\nancient relative of English that is related to Old English.\n\nAfter the town's near destruction following Smaug's rage, its\ninhabitants rebuilt it with more splendor and grandeur further down the\nlake. LAKE-TOWN is used to refer to the pre-Smaug town upon the Long\nLake, while the rebuilt, larger cousin further down the waterway is\nreferred to as ESGAROTH. The inhabitants also learned a crucially\nimportant, but painful, lesson bought with the blood of loved ones: the\ntown was built to be less susceptible to flame and its military was\nexpanded. These lessons greatly aided it during the War of the Ring.\n",

The land's name was inspired by Ungoliant, who resided\nthere after escaping the Balrogs of Morgoth and Lammoth. It is also\nnamed for its proximity to the Ered Gorgoroth, where Ungoliant's\nspider-like children, along with their many lesser fathers from the\nMountains of Terror, haunted the deep vales of the mountains and its\ncloseness to the shadowy webs of the Girdle of Melian.\n\nThe region was a perilous land of fear to travel through, as the waters\nwere polluted by the darkness produced from the webs of Ungoliant's\nchildren, and because of the chaos caused by the conflicting powers of\nUngoliant's demonic offspring, Sauron's malevolent sorcery, and the\nmaze-like defenses of the Girdle of Melian. All who foolish enough to\ndrink from its waters were filled with madness and thoughts of despair.\n\nNo one would travel through there unless they had no choice or were lost\nand the Eldar, Edain, and even Morgoth's own armies largely bypassed\nthis region as much as possible during the Elder Days.\n\nWhen Aredhel sought the Sons of Fëanor, her and her party being turned\naway for Doriath tried to pass through this land were separated from\nher. She managed to escape to Himlad but her companions were driven out\nby the brood of Ungoliant and afterwards they believed her loss in its\ndarkness. This was then reported to Turgon who despaired at the thought\nthat she was loss.\n\nAs the forces of Morgoth sought to destroy the remnants of Barahir's\nOutlaws, Beren, the last surviving member was so hard-pressed and\ndesperate to live that he was forced to enter this land, and barely\nsurvived. Afterwards, Beren would not speak of it for fear of the memory\nof such a horrible experience would return to his mind. Nan\nDungortheb suffered the same fate as the Beleriand and sank below the\nsea, but the spider creatures that bred there survived in\nMiddle-earth in dark places during later ages.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_NAN DUNGORTHEB_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Valley of Dreadful\nDeath'."

The sceptre of the Kings was lost with Ar-Pharazôn in\nthe destruction of Númenor in 3319 of the Second Age. But Elendil,\nthe last Lord of Andúnië, took his sceptre with him when he escaped from\nNúmenor and came to Middle-earth and founded the Kingdoms of Gondor and\nArnor. While the Kings of Gondor wore a crown, the Kings of Arnor bore\nthe sceptre. It became known as the Sceptre of Annúminas, the original\ncapital of the North-kingdom. After the North-kingdom was divided in 861\nthe sceptre passed to the Kings of Arthedain, and then, after Arthedain\nceased to exist in 1974, to the Chieftains of the Dúnedain. Since the\nDúnedain were a wandering people, the sceptre and other heirlooms were\nkept at Rivendell, home of Elrond.\n\nBy the end of the Third Age, the Sceptre of Annúminas was over 5,000\nyears old and was the oldest artifact of Men in Middle-earth, barring\nthe Ring of Barahir which was gifted to Barahir by the Elven king Finrod\nFelagund in the First Age as a symbol of the eternal friendship between\nmen and elves. On Midsummer's Eve of 3019, Elrond brought the Sceptre of\nAnnúminas to Minas Tirith and gave it to Aragorn, King Elessar, of the\nReunited Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe _SCEPTRE OF ANNÚMINAS_ was so named because the Kings of Arnor\ninitially ruled from the city of Annúminas. The name Annúminas means\n“tower of the west.” A sceptre, or scepter, is a staff held by a king as\nan emblem of authority."

    "title": "Gift of Men",
    "page_id": "7687",
    "text": "The GIFT OF MEN refers to a gift of Ilúvatar to his Younger Children,\nwhich remains a source of some confusion for Tolkien enthusiasts. The\nconcept includes both mortality, leading to death of old age, and free\nwill. Below are two interpretations of the nature and extent of the Gift\nof Men as articulated by Tolkien.\n\n\nA spiritual/theological view of the Gift of Men\n\nThe _Gift of Men_ was an act of the Supreme Being Ilúvatar that set the\nrace of Men apart from the Elves. While the race of Elves would know the\nmost bliss and contentment and would conceive more beauty than any\nothers of the Children of Ilúvatar, it was decreed by this gift that Men\nwould be the prime instruments of Ilúvatar within Arda.\n\nIlúvatar willed that the spirits/hearts of Men are not content within\nArda, and find no rest therein, and therefore seek beyond the world and\nits confines. They are not bound to the Circles of the World, as the\nElves and all other creatures of Arda are bound to the Earth. The\nspirits of Men truly leave the physical world, and do not return. Thus\ntheir fates are completely sundered from that of the Elves, who do not\ndie until the world dies, unless slain by violence or ill chance, or by\nwearying at the last of the passage of centuries. But as the years grow\nlong and Time wears, even the Valar will come to envy the gift of\nIlúvatar to the race of Men, that of liberation from the physical world,\nand the inevitability of loss and sorrows that must come with this\nexistence within Arda.\n\nMoreover, it is also a consequence of this true spiritual freedom of not\nbeing bound to either the ordinance of Fate, or the confines of the\nWorld that the spirits of Men do not dwell long in Arda, and after what\nseems to be a very short time to the immortal Elves, men age, grow\nweary, and die.\n\nHowever, a key aspect of this gift of living within Arda for a short\ntime was a virtue instilled into the race of Men to be motivated to\ncreate destinies for themselves amidst the powers and chances of the\nworld. Men were able to shape their lives _beyond_ the Music of the\nAinur, which rules the fates of all other things in Arda. Men may choose\nto live in tune with the themes of the Music that created Arda, or be\nindifferent to it, or live in defiance of it.\n\nIlúvatar understood that Men would not always use this gift of freedom\nin harmony with the world, and would stray often. But he knew that in\ntheir time, men would continue to order their lives within Arda and by\ntheir _“operation everything should be, in form and deed, completed, and\nthe world fulfilled unto the last and the smallest”_ (_The\nSilmarillion_). Thus Men would become the implements by which Ilúvatar's\nplans for Arda will be realized in the ages to come.\n\nThe Gift, as originally bequeathed, was not something that Men feared.\nThough they loved their lives within Arda, they relinquished their\nspirits gracefully, almost gladly, and seemed to pass into a peaceful\nsleep, never to wake again in this life. But their souls go to a place\nunknown to the wisest of Elves or even the Valar.\n\nHowever it is written that when the Second Music of the Ainur is played,\nafter the Dagor Dagorath, the spirits of Men shall be included in this\neven greater theme, when all of the players will know and understand\ntheir part and its relation to the whole, and be tributary to its beauty\nand glory.\n\n\nAvoidance of the Gift of Men\n\nThe shadow of the first Dark Lord brought with it a perversion of the\noriginal intent of the Gift of Ilúvatar, and brought fear out of hope,\nand tainted the Gift. Men began to fear and despise the gift, and began\nto view it not as liberation, but as damnation. It brought about in the\nrace of Men a kind of self-loathing and a denial of the basic nature of\ntheir being as the children of the All-Father Eru Ilúvatar. Instead they\nviewed themselves as flawed in some way and sought to resist this very\nintrinsic nature of their creation. The result of such actions brought\nabout much anguish on the race of Men through the centuries of the\nhistory of Arda.\n\nAt least four characters in _The Lord of the Rings_ are examples of the\ndangers of either deliberately or unintentionally trying to avoid the\nGift of Men. Three of them are transformed into “monsters” by being\ndenied the Gift of Men by sins that they have committed: the Lord of the\nNazgûl (and all of the Nazgûl), the King of the Dead, and Sméagol.\n(Since Sméagol is a Hobbit-like creature, he is numbered among the\nYounger Children of Ilúvatar, and as such is entitled to the strange\nGift of Men.) The Nazgûl are made immortal, but also doomed, by the Nine\nRings. The King of the Dead is transformed into a ghost or monster by\nthe curse of Isildur, because he and his subjects break an oath to fight\nagainst Sauron. Long after his natural death, he fulfils his oath, and\nis released from his condition by Aragorn. (This presumably also applies\nto the other Dead.) Sméagol is consumed by the Ring; over the years, its\ninfluence transforms him from a Hobbit into the freakish Gollum.\n\nBilbo Baggins, like Sméagol, is a Hobbit rather than a Man, but Hobbits\nare also among the Younger Children of Ilúvatar, and are therefore\nrecipients of the Gift of Men. Bilbo encounters Gollum in his cave and\nescapes with the Ring. Being a Hobbit of much better character than\nSméagol, Bilbo better resists the negative effects of possessing the One\nRing. He does not appear to age considerably, but has a sense of\nbecoming “thin and stretched.” Toward the end of his possession of the\nRing, Bilbo begins to show some of the obsessive tendencies of Gollum —\ncalling the Ring “my precious,” and showing flashes of dark hostility\nwhen asked by Gandalf to give the Ring to his heir, Frodo. After the\nRings destruction, Bilbo's appearance begins to show signs of age and\nweariness.\n\nThose Men with the greatest understanding treated death as the Gift it\nwas originally intended to be, and when their time came gladly gave\nthemselves up to it. We see this, for example, in the earlier Kings of\nNúmenor, and Aragorn also accepted the Gift at the natural end of his\nlife. For most Men, though, the Gift was tainted by Morgoth, and they\ncame to fear it rather than embrace it. This fear reached its peak in\nthe later years of Númenor, where even the long life given to the\nNúmenóreans was not enough, and wise men did all they could to try to\nescape death altogether. In the end, this desperation led to Númenor's\ndestruction when Ar-Pharazôn led a battle fleet to the Undying Lands,\nhaving been convinced by Sauron's lies that they held the key to the\nimmortality of the Elves. This deception and treachery eventually saw\nthe lifespans of Men return to more normal times. Even after millennia,\nthe descendants of Numenor still possessed some extended lifespans\nbeyond typical Men; these men became known as the Dúnedain. de:Gabe der\nMenschen it:Fato degli Uomini"

    "text": "The BATTLES OF LÓRIEN (never given a proper name in the text) is a\n battle of the north during the War of the Ring in J. R. R. Tolkien's\n_The Lord of the Rings_. Battles of Lórien were a series of encounters\nbetween the Uruks (Orc-folk) of Dol Guldur and Mordor against the\nGaladhrim of Lothlórien under the Lord Celeborn and Lady Galadriel,\nwhich took place March 11, 15, and 22 of 3019. The battles resulted in\nvictory for the Elves and allowed Celeborn to lead an assault on Dol\nGuldur, where Galadriel ended the evil influence of Sauron.\n\n\nThe Battles\n\nIt is unknown how the Orc army crossed the River Anduin, though the\nNorth Undeep seems the most likely place to ford. Forces from Dol\nGuldur, reinforced with Orcs from Mordor assaulted Lothlórien three\ntimes, assisted at least once in a joint attack from the west by the\nOrcs of Moria. Though the battles are not described in detail by\nTolkien, the fair woods of the borders of Lothlórien suffered grievous\nharm by fire, though the valour of the Elves prevented the enemy from\npenetrating too deeply into their forest realm. Thrice the enemy\nattacked, and the three times the assaults were driven back.\n\nThe valour of the Elven people that lived in Lórien was great, but\nTolkien states that the main reason why Lórien was not conquered was\n“the power that dwelt there was far too great for any to overcome, save\nif Sauron had come there himself”. Such power was the Lady Galadriel,\nwearing Nenya, who was able to defeat the Orcs; who then fled south\ntowards into Fangorn Forest. Treebeard and a host of Ents, having\nalready laid ruin to Isengard some days before set out to prevent them\nentering Rohan. The despairing Orcs fled eastward but were either killed\nby the tree-shepherds, drowned in the River Anduin or fled to Dol\nGuldur.\n\n\nAftermath\n\nFollowing the battle, Celeborn and Galadriel led the Galadhrim across\nthe Anduin in a fleet of many small elf boats. They entered Mirkwood and\nattacked Dol Guldur. Then, Galadriel came forth and threw down the walls\nand cleansed its pits with her power, and ended the grasp of evil in the\nforest. Dol Guldur was no more. As news of the victory of King Elessar\ndown south reached the Wood-elves, Thranduil (who had recently defeated\nan army in the Battle of Mirkwood) met with Celeborn on April 6.\n\nMirkwood was divided between Thranduil (who claimed the North), the\nBeornings (who settled in the middle, the 'Narrows') and Celeborn who\nadded the southern half to his realm, renaming it 'East Lórien'. Despite\nthese victories, the Elves began to dwindle and Celeborn himself\ndeparted over the Sea during the early Fourth Age.",

    "text": "This is an overview of the COSMOLOGY of J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth\nlegendarium. Each entry is followed by any alternate names, any roughly\ncorresponding primary world name in parentheses, and a brief\ndescription. A question mark after the primary world name indicates that\nthe identification may be partially speculative or disputed.\n\n-   TIMELESS HALLS, (Heaven) - The home of Eru (God) outside of Time.\n    They are similar to Heaven in that they exist outside the boundaries\n    of the universe and in that they do not have a physical form. It is\n    unknown whether they are the final destination of the souls of Men.\n    This is a distinct possibility, however. In fact, it is confirmed in\n    the tale of Adanel that Men return to Eru, but it is questionable\n    that this tale can be considered canon, although Christopher Tolkien\n    once considered putting it in the appendices of the Silmarillion.\n\n-   THE VOID, Avakúma, Kúma, the Outer Dark, the Eldest Dark, the\n    Everlasting Dark - An abstract, uninhabited region of nothingness\n    described as existing outside the Timeless Halls, Arda, and all of\n    Eä. It is possible that the Void outside of Eä and the one\n    surrounding Arda were different, but this is not clearly defined. No\n    being in the Void can use any power they possess within the Void.\n    Melkor was cast into THE VOID after the War of Wrath, but legend\n    predicts his return to the world before the end, in Dagor Dagorath.\n\n-   EÄ, (the Universe) - EÄ is the Quenya name for the universe, as a\n    realization of the vision of the Ainur. The word comes from the\n    Quenya word for _to be_. Thus, Eä is _the World that Is_, as\n    distinguished from _the World that Is Not_. It may thus be assumed\n    that everything outside Eä, including the Timeless Halls of\n    Ilúvatar, has no material form. The Ainur, angelic beings from the\n    Timeless Halls beyond Eä, refer to it as “the Little Kingdom”. This\n    refers to the fact that within the mind of Eru Ilúvatar (God), all\n    creation that humans can see is really just a tiny thing in\n    comparison. _Eä_ was the word spoken by Eru Ilúvatar by which he\n    brought the universe into actuality.\n\n    -   ARDA, Ilu - See Arda. The world, including everything in the\n        skies around it.\n\n        -   VAIYA, Ekkaia, the Enfolding Ocean, the Encircling Sea,\n            (Outer space) - A dark sea that surrounds the world before\n            the cataclysm at the end of the Second Age. Vaiya flows\n            completely around the world, forming a sea below it and a\n            form of air above it. Arda is described as floating on\n            Vaiya, like a ship on a sea. Ulmo, the Lord of Waters,\n            dwells in Vaiya, below the roots of Arda. Vaiya is described\n            as extremely cold. Where its waters meet the waters of\n            Belegaer in the northwest of Middle-earth, a chasm of ice is\n            formed, the Helcaraxë. Vaiya cannot support any ships except\n            the boats of Ulmo; the ships of the Númenóreans that tried\n            to sail on it sank, drowning the sailors. After Arda was\n            made round, Vaiya apparently disappeared, although it may\n            have been changed into the upper atmosphere of the world.\n\n            -   ILMEN, (the Solar system) - A region of clean air\n                pervaded by light before the cataclysm at the end of the\n                Second Age. The stars and other celestial bodies are\n                found in this region. Tolkien likely derived its name\n                from _ilma_, the Finnish word for air. The Moon passes\n                through Ilmen on its way around the world, plunging down\n                the Chasm of Ilmen on its way back.\n\n                -   ALCARINQUE, Morwen, Silindo, (Jupiter?)\n\n                -   ANARRIMA\n\n                -   ANOR, Ur, (the Sun) See Sun.\n\n                -   BORGIL, (Aldebaran?)\n\n                -   CARNIL, (Mars?)\n\n                -   EARENDIL’S STAR, Gil-Amdir, Gil-Estel,\n                    Gil-Oresetel, Gil-Orrain, (Venus)\n\n                -   EKSIQILTA, Ekta-, (Orion’s Belt)\n\n                -   ELEMMÍRË, (Mercury?)\n\n                -   HELLUIN, Gil, Nielluin, Nierninwa, (Sirius)\n\n                -   ITHIL, Silmo, (the Moon) See Moon.\n\n                -   LUINIL, (Uranus?)\n\n                -   LUMBAR, (Saturn?)\n\n                -   MENELVAGOR, Daimord, Menelmacar, Mordo,\n                    Swordsman of the Sky, Taimavar, Taimondo,\n                    Telimbektar, Telimektar, Telumehtar, (Orion) - A\n                    constellation meant to represent Túrin Turambar and\n                    his eventual return to defeat Melkor in The Last\n                    Battle.

It also formed the\n                    symbol of Durin, seen on the doors of Moria, and\n                    inspired a song of defiance from Beren. According to\n                    the _Silmarillion_, it was set in the Northern Sky\n                    as a sign of doom for Melkor and a sign of hope for\n                    the Elves. The Valacirca is one of the few\n                    constellations named in the book, another\n                    significant one being Menelvagor.\n\n                -   WILWARIN, (Cassiopeia?)\n\n                -   VISTA, Air, (the Atmosphere) - Vista is the\n                    breathable air.\n\n                    -   FANYAMAR, Cloudhome - The upper air where clouds\n                        form.\n\n                    -   AIWENÓRË, Bird-land - The lower air where the\n                        paths of birds are found.\n\n                        -   AMBAR, Imbar, (Earth) - The actual solid\n                            land mass of the world.

    "text": "The BREAKING OF THE FELLOWSHIP was the event during the first book which\nthe Fellowship of the Ring splits up and all go their separate ways.\nFrodo and Sam go to Mordor, Boromir is killed, Merry and Pippin are\nkidnapped by the Uruk-hai and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli pursue them\ninto Rohan. Dated at February 26, 3019, it occured at the end of _The\nFellowship of the Ring_ and at the very beginning of _The Two Towers_.\n\n\nHistory\n\nTen days after leaving Lothlórien, the fellowship are rowing down the\nAnduin in the boats given to them by Galadriel. They stop at Amon Hen\nwhere they have to decide which way to go next (straight towards Mordor\non the Eastern side of the river, or to Minas Tirith on the Western side\nto gain Gondor's aid). Opinion is divided on this as Boromir wants to\npass through Gondor, the land of his people, which he thinks will be the\nsafer option. Also, not understanding the power of the Ring, he thinks\nthat Gondor would be able to use it and so have the power to overthrow\nSauron. However, Aragorn is reluctant to lead the ring anywhere near\nMinas Tirith, as he does not trust Denethor and his men. While they are\nresting, Frodo walks off alone to sit beside the river and the Falls of\nRauros. He is soon joined by Boromir, who talks to Frodo, giving him\nadvice, although Frodo has already been warned by Galadriel that his\nfriends will turn against him. Boromir's words become more and more\naggressive, saying that the Ring should not be destroyed, but used\nagainst Sauron, and he asks Frodo to lend him the Ring. When Frodo\nrefuses, he becomes angry and tries to take it by force, causing Frodo\nto put on the Ring, disappear and run away. After a minute he realizes\nwhat he has done and weeps, begging Frodo to come back, but Frodo is\nalready far away.\n\nFrodo then realizes the effect that the Ring is having on his\ncompanions, and that slowly it will destroy them all. He decides to\ncontinue the Quest on his own and from there journeys to Mordor alone,\nso that his friends will not have to suffer on his behalf. As he is\nabout to leave in the boat, Sam comes running out and insists on going\nwith Frodo. When Frodo tells him to go back, Sam wades out into the\nwater towards the boat even though he cannot swim, and begins to drown,\nprompting Frodo to rescue him. Although originally annoyed, Frodo\nrealizes that Sam will be useful for the journey ahead, and that he\nneeds a good friend to help him along. The Fellowship of the Ring ends\nwith Frodo and Sam beginning their journey together towards Mordor.\n\nThe Two Towers opens with the rest of the fellowship searching for\nFrodo, until they hear Boromir's horn, signalling that he was in need,\nalong with Orc voices. Aragorn arrives to find Boromir lying by a tree\nsurrounded by dead Orcs, and pierced with many arrows. With Boromir's\nlast words he tells Aragorn not to let Minas Tirith fall. He also tells\nhim that the Orcs (later known to be Uruk-hai) have taken the Hobbits.\nReturning to the boats and finding one gone, along with Frodo and Sam's\npacks, Aragorn concludes that Frodo and Sam have gone on alone to\nMordor. The Three Hunters (Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli) then have to\ndecide whether to follow Frodo and Sam or to go after the Uruk-hai to\nrescue Merry and Pippin. Aragorn eventually decides that the fate of the\nRingbearer was no longer in his hands, and refusing to abandon Merry and\nPippin to torment and death, decides to go after them.\n\n\nPortrayal in Adaptions\n\nFilms\n\nIn Ralph Bakshi's version, Boromir confronts Frodo in his thinking place\nand Frodo talks of his fears. Boromir offers his advice to Frodo and\nFrodo already knows of what he wants him to do and that was to take the\nRing to Gondor to defend Minas Tirith. Boromir becomes irritated with\nthe decision to destroy the Ring and Frodo tries to tell him that all\nthat touches the Ring turns to evil, but Boromir doesn't listen and asks\nFrodo to lend him the Ring. Frodo refuses and Boromir tries to seize him\nand take the Ring by force. He jumps forward but Frodo gets away.\nBoromir curses him and accuses him of being a traitor. He then comes to\nhis senses and begs Frodo to come back but to no avail as Frodo has\nalready gone. Boromir returns to Aragorn and the others and is asked\nwhere he has been he confesses what he had done to Frodo. Sam becomes\nconcerned and runs away to search for Frodo. Aragorn tries to maintain\ncontrol and asks Legolas and Gimli to stop them. He grabs Boromir and\norders him to protect Merry and Pippin.\n\nThe Orcs band appears and try to seize the Halflings. Boromir reappears\nand fights them killing several by to no avail as he was pierced by many\narrows, and the hobbits are taken. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli arrive,\nbut they are too late. Boromir tells Aragorn that he tried to take the\nRing and begs Aragorn to go to Minas Tirith to save his people. Aragorn\nagrees and then Boromir dies. They set Boromir in one of their boats\nwith his helmet and weapons and then talk. Aragorn speaks of the\nbreaking of the Fellowship and that the fate of the Ring being out of\ntheir hands and makes the decision to follow the orcs that took Merry\nand Pippin."

Amon Rûdh lay to the east as well, and many miles to\nthe north were the Pools of Ivrin in Eithel Ivrin. Southeast of the\nTalath Dirnen lay the Doors of Nargothrond; and beyond rose the\nTaur-en-Faroth, the Forest of the Hunters above the banks of Narog.\n\nReaching north and east of Nargothrond, chief city of the Kingdom of\nFinrod Felagund, the plain was a major buffer between Felagund's land\nand the threat of Morgoth in his far northern fortress of Angband. The\nSilmarillion says of the Talath Dirnen:\n\nThe landscape of the Talath Dirnen was said to be rolling and mostly\nopen. A few patches of forest provided cover for Felagund's rangers,\nincluding at the feet of Amon Ethir, the Hill of Spies. The greatest of\nTalath Dirnen's watchtowers, it was so named for the rangers that\nguarded it, whose keen elvish sight could descry any approaching enemy.\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Guarded Plain is the place of two significant events of the\nSilmarillion. Beren Camlost son of Barahir crosses the Talath Dirnen\nafter departing from Menegroth to begin his Quest for a Silmaril.\nSeeking the aid of Felagund, and knowing the skill of the rangers, Beren\nholds ever aloft the Ring of Barahir and is eventually waylaid and taken\nby Felagund's soldiers to Nargothrond. Years later, a bridge is built\nacross Narog from Talath Dirnen to Nargothrond at the order of Túrin\nTurambar. This helps lead to the sack of Nargothrond at the hands of\nGlaurung the Dragon and Morgoth's forces. After the sack, Niënor Níniel\nencounters Glaurung near Amon Ethir and falls under his spell,\nfurthering the curse laid upon the Children of Húrin by Morgoth.\n\nIt was sunk along with the most of Beleriand at the end of the War of\nWrath.\n"

When Rían learned of Huor's\ndeath during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad (Battle of Unnumbered Tears), she\nwent into the wilderness to weep for him, and was never seen again.

He was able to find one of Ulmo's rivers and follow it down to\nthe Great Sea. He tarried there a while, but after some swans showed him\na sign that he had stayed too long, he went south. There he found an\nold, ruinous road, which led to Vinyamar, Turgon's old home. Soon\nthereafter, Ulmo himself appeared to Tuor and requested that he find\nTurgon. Tuor then found Voronwë, a mariner that had once sought the\nhavens of Círdan. He was originally from Gondolin, and he promised to\nlead Tuor there.

They settled in the Twenty-first\nHall, above the East-gate, and Balin himself ruled his new domain from\nthe old Chamber of Records, also called the Chamber of Mazarbul.

King Thranduil of the Sindar rules over the Silvan Elves.\nThe Elves of the Woodland Realm, unlike many Elves, were known to be\nless wise and more dangerous, but were nevertheless one of the most\npowerful and legendary of the Elves of Middle-earth.\n\nLegolas, a key member of the Fellowship of the Ring in the Third Age,\nhailed from here.\n\n\nHistory\n\nEarly\n\nDuring the latter half of the Years of the Trees and the First Age, the\nNandorin and Avarin Elves populated the forest between the Misty\nMountains and the Far East lands, mixing themselves together becoming\nSilvan Elves or Wood-elves. It is not known how they lived but it is\npossible they lived in small tribal groups wandering the forest.\n\nSecond Age\n\nAfter the War of Wrath and the destruction of the Beleriand, Oropher, a\nSindarin prince formerly of Doriath who chose to stay in Middle-earth,\ncame to the forest known as Greenwood the Great. He and his company were\nwell received and well accepted as they had once lived with King\nThingol, whom they regarded as distant kin. The Sindarin company\nintended to live like the Wood-elves: natural and undisturbed. This\nnotion was appealing to the Wood-elves and Oropher was soon named their\nking, adopting their language and way of life.\n\nAfter being named King of the Woodland Realm, Oropher established his\ncapital on Amon Lanc in the southern part of the forest. The Woodland\nrealm flourished in peace with its boundaries unchanged and way of life\nundisturbed for over a millennium. Sometime after SA 1000, Oropher had\nhis capital moved further north in around the Mountains of Mirkwood. The\nmain reason for this was the growing threat of Sauron in the East.\nOropher and his people also felt threatened by the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm\nand by the presence of Celeborn and Galadriel in the forest. Despite\nthese problems, the Elves of the Woodland Realm still continued to roam\nthe south of the forest westward down the Anduin.\n\nOver one hundred years after the Downfall of Númenor, the threat of\nSauron once again grew into a very real threat to Middle-earth. Oropher\nand the Elves of Lórien under Amdír both agreed that peace could not be\nresorted until Sauron was completely defeated. A large army was created\nand a combined force of Wood-elves and Galadhrim marched to support the\nLast Alliance of Elves and Men. Though they were as determined to defeat\nSauron as the others, Oropher and Amdír's army was lightly armed and\nless experienced in major warfare. They also refused to submit to the\nsupreme authority of Gil-galad due to past disputes with Ñoldor, and so\nfought independently. They suffered heavy losses and Oropher and Amdír\nwere both killed. Oropher's son survived the war and took his father's\nplace as King of the Woodland Realm.\n\nThird Age\n\nDespite the heavy losses their people had suffered during the War of the\nLast Alliance, the Elves of the Woodland Realm survived and continued\nliving peacefully in the forest for the next millennium. The peace was\nbroken in TA 1050 when a mysterious being known as the Necromancer began\nliving in the abandoned halls of Amon Lanc. Afterwards, the forest\nbecame dark and tainted, infested with Orcs, Great Spiders, and other\nmysterious and savage beings. The elves were then forced to remove\nthemselves to the northernmost part of the forest. All settlements in\nthe Mountains of Mirkwood were withdrawn and the capital and realm's\npeople relocated to a cave settlement under a wooded hill, in the\nnortheastern border of the forest. From then on, the Woodland Realm\nremained confined to the north. It was at this time that the Elves\nrenamed the forest to Mirkwood along other with other places they\nformerly occupied.\n\nThe Elves of the Woodland Realm survived but lived more cautiously\nconsidering the increased danger. They traded with the neighboring\nrealms of the Lonely Mountain and Dale. This however was not to last as\nthe Elves, Rhovanion and much of Middle-earth was affected by bad\nweather culminating in the Long Winter of TA 2758 and TA 2759 and the\nFell Winter of TA 2911 - TA 2912, during which extreme cold and large\nblankets of snow plagued the lands. However, the most devastating blow\nto the Woodland Realm until the War of the Ring came in TA 2770 when the\ndragon Smaug came down from the North and destroyed both the Dwarves of\nthe Lonely Mountain and the Mannish town of Dale. Afterwards, the elves\nmoved about the forest in secret and were very distrustful of any\nstrangers and their only contact with the outside world was trade and\noccasional visitation with the refugees of Dale living in Laketown on\nthe Long Lake. It was probably during this time that the Elves made the\nForest Path which ran across the northern forest as the only safe\npassage, as the main road that ran through was no longer safe.\n\nIn TA 2941, Thorin and Company came through the Woodland Realm on their\nway to the Lonely Mountain on The Quest of Erebor. Thranduil considered\nthem trespassers and had them imprisoned save for Bilbo, who remained\ninvisible with the use of his Magic Ring, who later released them.\nAfter the death of Smaug, Thranduil offered relief to the Men of\nLaketown for Bard’s valiant slaying of the dragon and assembled an army\nto claim part of the treasure, but Thorin refused to share it and so\nboth parties prepared for war. Bilbo tried to help the situation by\ndelivering the ancient artifact known as the Arkenstone to the Elves and\nMen.\n\nThe situation did not improve and with arrival of a Dwarven army of\nfive-hundred under Dáin II Ironfoot, and it seemed as if the Elves and\nMen would fight the Dwarves, but the timely arrival of Gandalf with a\nwarning of an army of Goblins and Wargs coming to do battle for the\ntreasure changed everything. The Elves, Men, and Dwarves were forced to\njoin forces and fight a common enemy. The Wood-elves and their allies,\nincluding the late-arriving Eagles, defeated the orcs and many lay dead,\nbut peace finally returned to the region with the Orcs defeated and news\nof the White Council having driven the Necromancer out of Dol Guldur.\n\nPeace for the Elves of the Woodland Realm reigned for decades until Dol\nGuldur once again was inhabited by evil creatures and Mordor grew in\npower and influence. The Woodland Realm became involved directly in the\nWar of the Ring when the creature Gollum was captured by Aragorn and\nimprisoned there, but an orc raid allowed him to escape. Afterwards,\nThranduil sent his son Legolas to Rivendell as a representative of the\nWoodland Realm and to inform the Council of Gollum’s escape.\n\nThe Woodland Realm was attacked on March 15, 3019 by forces from Dol\nGuldur, becoming part of the Battles of the North. Thranduil and the\nWood-elves were victorious and the forest was eventually cleansed of all\nits enemies and as Galadriel had thrown down the walls Dol Guldur, there\nwas no longer any threat from there and the shadow was permanently\nremoved from the forest. On April 6, 3019, Thranduil met with Celeborn\nand both agreed to rename the forest Eryn Lasgalen (Wood of\nGreenleaves). Soon after the war, the forest was divided with Thranduil\nleft to rule most of the northern part.\n\nFourth Age\n\nThe Woodland Realm people played an important role during the early\nyears when a group of Elves from the Woodland Realm led by Legolas\ntraveled to Gondor and helped rebuild the city of Minas Tirith and\nreplenished and beautified the war-ravaged lands of Ithilien. It is\npresumed that the realm prospered but like the other non-mannish realms\nit most likely became isolated and unto itself. Its fate is unknown but\nas some Elves left Middle-earth during the Fourth Age and the dominion\nof Man was at hand, the Wood-elves of the Woodland Realm may have\neventually become hidden and ultimately invisible to the eyes of Men.",

    "text": "THE FAITHFUL, also known as ELENDILI or ELF-FRIENDS, referred to the\nminority faction of Númenóreans who remained friendly with the Elves and\nrespectful and obedient to the Valar. Their most noted leader was\nElendil, the Lord of Andúnië, who later founded the kingdoms of Arnor\nand Gondor in Middle-earth.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Faithful emerged as a result of the divisions that occurred by the\nclose of the Second Age. The Númenóreans had become split between the\nElendili and the King's Men, a faction centered around the King that\nsought to assert Númenórean authority and self-determination. With\nNúmenor reaching the apex of its might, the King's Men eventually\nespoused open defiance of the Valar. This split would eventually\nprecipitate the Fall of Númenor.\n\nThe Elendili, however, not only preserved their ancient friendship with\nthe Elves, they also regarded the burgeoning arrogance of the King's Men\nas blasphemy, but the King's Men became more powerful, and by the end of\nthe Second Age had begun to persecute the Elendili as rebels and\ndissidents. Fearing their growing strength, the King's men secured the\nFaithful's deportation from their strongholds in the western regions,\nnotably around the city Andúnië.\n\nThe seeds of the Faithful were sown in the days of Tar-Minastir and\nTar-Ciryatan; the group arose in the early twenty-third century of the\nSecond Age during the days of Tar-Ancalimon with Andúnië as their chief\ncity where the Elves were received with love. As use of Elven-tongues\nand respect for the Valar began to wane, the Faithful became the only\nones to preserve these traditions unto themselves. In SA 2350 seeing the\ncoming shadow, the Faithful founded the haven of Pelargir on the shores\nof Middle-earth as opposed to Umbar which became a haven of the King's\nMen. As the King's Men's influence grew and the people and their rulers\nbecame more and more greedy of wealth and power, there arose Ar-Gimilzôr\nin SA 3102. Being one of the King's Men, he openly persecuted the\nFaithful, forbidding the teaching and speaking of the Elven tongues nor\nwas meeting with Elves permitted either. The Faithful were then forced\nto move from the west havens to Rómenna where they were carefully\nwatched. In these evil days, many of the Faithful emigrated to the\nfriendly havens in Middle-earth.\n\nSome relief came to them in SA 3177, when Elf-friend Tar-Palantir\nassumed kingship and began to turn Númenor back to the ways of the\nFaithful. He repented the ways of his forefathers, stopped the\npersecution of the Faithful, and tried to amend the corruption of\nNúmenor but his line failed and the King's Men survived. Tar-Palantir's\nnephew Ar-Pharazôn, son of Gimilkhâd forcibly usurped the throne and the\nElendili were more vigorously oppressed. He defeated Sauron, the Dark\nLord and took him prisoner to Númenor. It was not long before the King\nlistened to his evil words and took him deep into his councils, Sauron\nplaying off his fear of death. This time with the help of the Dark Lord\nSauron, who had established an evil cult on the island to corrupt and\neventually destroy Númenórean society.\n\n\n\nIt was during these dark times that the Faithful endured their most\ngrievous woe for the King. During this time the Faithful were hunted,\nkilled and even sacrificed in Sauron's temple to the cult of Melkor.\nWhen the King prepared the Great Armament, Amandil, the current leader\nof the Faithful attempted to sail to Aman to beg for forgiveness and\nmercy from the Valar. Before doing so, he entrusted his son with the\ntask of preparing a fleet of ships to depart to Middle-earth to escape\nthe coming darkness. As Ar-Pharazôn led his grand armada to Aman to\nchallenge the Ban of the Valar, Elendil and the remaining, Elf-friends\nwere warned by the divine powers to leave Númenor forever. They were\nthus spared the downfall of Númenor when, as punishment for an attempt\nto defy the Ban, Eru Ilúvatar sank the island kingdom into the\nsea.\n\nWhen Númenor was destroyed in SA 3319, the fleet reached the shores of\nMiddle-earth founding the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor in a lineage of\nnobility leading up to King Elessar. The Elendili, under the leadership\nof Elendil and his sons, eventually made their way to refuge in\nMiddle-Earth where they were welcomed by the Elves.",

    "text": "A SCIMITAR is a sword with a curved blade design in Middle-earth finding\nits origins in the Misty Mountains and Harad.\n\n\nOrc\n\nThe Orcs of the Misty Mountains usually use scimitar.\n\nIn the book of _The Hobbit_, the bodyguard of Bolg wielded steel\nscimitars in the Battle of Five Armies. _In The Lord of the Rings_, the\nFellowship found orc-scimitars with blackened blades in the Chamber of\nMazarbul. Later, a high orc-chieftain clothed in black mail with a spear\nand a scimitar rushed into the Chamber. He was slain by Andúril when he\nswept out the scimitar after his spear was broken and hacked by Sam. At\nthe flight of the Fellowship, Frodo saw that nearly hundreds of orcs\nbrandished scimitars and spears in the firelight in the First Hall near\nthe Bridge of Khazad-dum.\n\nThe goblin-soldiers of Isengard did use short broad-bladed swords\ninstead of curved scimitars which was unusual for Orcs. Aragorn\ndistinguished four of them from the slain, and he knew Orcs from the\nNorth normally wielded scimitars.\n\nThe Orcs of Mordor have made straight blades too, and their blade are\nlonger than Isengarders. Grishnákh carried a black knife with a long\njagged blade. Shagrat had a long red knife, and he drove this knife into\nGorbag's throat.\n\n\nHaradrim\n\nThe Haradrim are the civilization most commonly described as using\nscimitars, with their cavalry bringing scimitars onto the Pelennor. In\nthe books, their scimitars were “like a glitter of stars”, but in the\nmovies the only metal they have are gold plates worn as trophies.\nThrough a movie standpoint, the Haradrim would have likely made these\nscimitars by combining a stone, bone, or obsidian blade with a wood,\nstone, or bone handle. These scimitars can typically be 3 foot 6 inch in\nlength, with the blade being blunt for the first 10 inches to avoid\nself-laceration (exposing 4 inches of blunt blade and 30 inches of sharp\nblade)\n\n\nEtymology\n\nTolkien uses the term “scimitar” to describe any curved blade existing\nin Middle-earth. However, there are other kinds of curved blades,\nincluding forwards-curving ones like the Kopis and the Falcutta. Some\nbackwards-curving blades do not count as scimitars in swordsmanship, but\nin the case of Middle-earth as Tolkien describes it, _any_ curved blade\nis a scimitar. The scimitar in the picture is actually a falchion; a\nscimitar is a backwards-curving blade on a J-shaped handle with a\ncross-guard that curved up on the sharp side and down on the dull side.\nThe blade curve was asymmetrical to the handle curve."

The title continued in\nMiddle-earth after the Ñoldor returned in pursuit of Morgoth. Fëanor or\nthe eldest of his sons could have claimed the title but with his death\nMaedhros waived his claim to the title and ceded it to House of\nFingolfin, out of respect and friendship with them. There were four\nlegitimate High Kings in Middle-earth beginning with Fingolfin and\nending with Gil-galad at the end of Second Age, lasting over\nfour-thousand years. Turgon's relatives Eärendil and then Elrond could\nhave made a claim to the title but never did. It is possible that the\nHigh Kingship passed exclusively through the male line; if this is the\ncase, then the title became effectively extinct with the death of\nGil-galad in Middle-earth. Eärendil and his descendants belonged to the\nhuman House of Hador.\n\n\nSuccession\n\nThe succession of the kingship was never planned, likely because Elves\ncould not die and there would be no need for succession. But in the\nworse case, the Elves followed the rule that the eldest child should\nsucceed. Such was the case with Fëanor, who immediately claimed the\ntitle after Finwe's death at the hands of Morgoth. But he could not\ncommand the same respect, for greater love was given to Fingolfin for\nhis wisdom and leadership, and the Ñoldor of Tirion refused to renounce\nhim.\n\nAfter the death of Fëanor, Maedhros was due to succeed by right, yet in\nrepentance of his father's acts he waived his claim to Fingolfin. This\nmove was recognised by all, and the Kingship belonged solely to the\nHouse of Fingolfin. Fingon was the elder son who succeeded his father.\nStrangely however, after Fingon's demise he was not succeeded by his son\nGil-galad, but by Turgon his brother. Once again this would suggest\nloyalty and respect in such a decision, as Turgon was older and more\nexperienced at the time.

The ram nearly spelled certain doom for the innocent women\nand children of Hornburg, they screamed and sobbed in terror as they\nheard the ram slowly hammer away at the gate.

It is generally used to refer to the evil of Morgoth and of Sauron\nover the Ages.\n\n\nHistory of Darkness\n\nThe rebellion of Melkor tampered with and poisoned the original perfect\nsymmetry of Arda and corrupted all the works of the Ainur, but his chief\nworks of Darkness fell upon the souls of the Children of Ilúvatar. After\nhis decline and fall, his successor Sauron continued his works of evil\nuntil he too was defeated.\n\nDarkness and Men\n\nOf all the races in Arda, Men were the easiest to corrupt and drive into\ntemptation and thus were most afflicted by the Darkness. Not long after\nthey awoke, Morgoth, probably appearing as a black rider on a black\nsteed convinced them to worship him as their god instead of Eru, but\nsome escaped and repented, becoming the Edain, the ancestors of the\nDúnedain, but most still remained in darkness. Those that did remain and\nnever went West remained loyal to Morgoth became known as Easterlings\nand were ever allied with the dark powers throughout the long ages\neither for hope of conquest or plunder.\n\nIn the Second Age when the men of Númenor fell under the shadow, their\nfaith wavered and their hearts turned ever to Darkness. Then Sauron came\nand was soon the master of the King's council and men fell ever further\ninto the Shadow, convincing many of the faithless to worship Morgoth in\nthe everlasting Darkness beyond. Here the chief hurt was that men grew\nafraid of death, a fear that lingered on all men. The embassy from\nValinor speculated that this was the first sign of the shadow in\nNumenor. Afterwards, Darkness continued to compel men to follow its\nbanner serving both themselves and Sauron even after his defeat in the\nWar of the Ring.\n\nIt is possible that this is the “shadow” Gandalf is referring to when he\ncommands Durin’s Bane to “Go back to the shadow!”.\n\nLegacy of Darkness\n\nMarring its original design, the advent of Darkness has brought the\nworld its greatest woe but has brought many together who opposed it. As\nmen whose souls are forever corrupted with the seeds of Darkness brought\ndown upon them by Morgoth and Sauron inherit the world after the Fourth\nAge, they may still have to face it again and again until the end of the\nworld when all Darkness is prophesized to be defeated."

For hundreds of years they prospered\nand grew immensely wealthy, but Sauron ever hungry for dominion over\nMiddle-earth was jealous of their power. He approached them in SA 1200\ndisguised as Annatar (The Lord of Gifts) and the Noldor, ever eager for\nmore knowledge, accepted his gifts and instruction. They also followed\nhim because although they loved Middle-Earth they wanted to have the\nBliss of Valinor. They could do this with the skills they would learn\nfrom him and make the land of their exile as beautiful as Eressea.

Men, Dwarves, Hobbits and most\nother races cannot live forever and thus are subject to aging and\nnatural death however various members of those races have endured longer\nextended lifespans beyond normal constraints through various means. In\nTolkien's universe, despite many having a desire for it, immortality is\nnot desirable for those who are of mortal kind. Every race has a set\nspan; to exceed this span proves to be agony for mortals. There are many\nexamples of this throughout his work: the kings of Numenor who became\nwitless and agonized by attempting to cling to life as long as possible\n(as opposed to earlier kings who gave up their lives willingly);\nGollum's transformation into a twisted and starved thing after having\nhis life extended nearly 5 times longer than it should have been via the\nOne Ring; Bilbo's comment on his 111th birthday about feeling “thin and\nstretched”, like “butter being spread on too much bread”, this also\nbeing an effect of the One Ring. The only time mortals have ever been\naccorded peace in immortality is when they are accounted of the Elves:\nthis choice has been mostly restricted to the Peredhil, the Half-Elven\n(the one known exception to this being Tuor, who was born a full-blooded\nMan but was given the choice to be accounted among the Eldar).\n\nThe Army of the Dead was cursed by Isildur with immortality in form of\nan existence as undead skeletons after they abandoned their oath in the\nWar of the Last Alliance. Their only chance of dying was to fulfill\ntheir oath.\n\nIn the latter half of the Second Age, Sauron's corruption of the\nNumenorean King Ar-Pharazôn made him believe that if he could invade and\nconquer the Blessed Land, he could become immortal, resulting in the\ndestruction of Numenor and Ar-Pharazôn's imprisonment.\n\nit:Immortalità"

    "text": "'REALMS IN EXILE' was the collective name for the kingdoms, Arnor and\nGondor, established by the Dunedain in Middle-earth after they escaped\nthe Downfall of Númenor. For much of the Third Age, they were the\ndominant powers in the north-west of Middle-earth, and had an enduring\npolitical, economic and cultural significance. Initially politically\nunited, they soon became separate kingdoms, but retained much of their\ncommon culture, and later entered into an alliance. Arnor broke apart\ninto petty kingdoms, the last of which fell in TA 1974. Gondor survived\nand, though becoming ever weaker, it remained the most powerful state\namong the so-called “Free Peoples”. After the War of the Ring, Gondor\nand the former territories of Arnor were merged into the Reunited\nKingdom.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBoth Arnor and Gondor were feudal absolute monarchies. Their first High\nKing was Elendil the Tall, the leader of the fugitives who escaped\nduring the Akallabêth and a member of the old Númenórean nobility. He\nruled Arnor directly, while Gondor was ruled jointly by his sons,\nIsildur and Anárion, who acted as his vassals. As a result of the War of\nthe Last Alliance (see below), the two kingdoms were politically\nseparated; Arnor was ruled by Isildur's descendants, and Gondor by those\nof Anárion. In a departure from Númenórean practice, equal primogeniture\nwas abolished in favour of an exclusively male succession, perhaps\nbecause of the role the King had in both realms as supreme army\ncommander and the frequent wars in which the realms were embroiled.\n\nWhile Arnor and Gondor are called “the realms of the Dúnedain”, in fact\nthe Dúnedain made up only a small part of their population. The bulk of\nthe human population in the north-west of Middle-earth consisted of\nnative Men and descendants of earlier Númenórean colonists, the two\ngroups having intermingled to varying degrees. The Dúnedain who arrived\nwith Elendil and his sons, being of pure Númenórean blood and culture,\nwere more gifted and powerful than the local inhabitants. Furthermore,\nthe House of Elendil commanded particular respect and loyalty on account\nof his descent from Elros and his ancestors' leadership of the Faithful\nin Númenor itself. The Dúnedain therefore quickly established themselves\nas a sort of hereditary aristocracy, and provided many of the realms'\nleading statesmen, administrators and military commanders. However,\nlocal tribes and lordships, many held by families not of Númenórean\ndescent, persisted, especially away from the great cities. Unlike the\nearlier colonists, the Dúnedain came to discourage intermarriage with\nthose they termed “lesser Men,” fearing perhaps that their gifts would\nbe bred out; this policy eventually had disastrous consequences for\nGondor.\n\nAmong themselves, the Dúnedain spoke a dialect of Sindarin, in token of\ntheir ancient friendship with the Elves, and to set themselves apart\nfrom the hostile “Black Númenóreans” who had established lordships in\nthe more southerly regions of Middle-earth. But in dealings with their\nsubject peoples and the surrounding nations, they used Westron, a\ndescendant of the Adûnaic language of Númenor, closely related to many\nof the Mannish dialects that already prevailed in their territories. In\nthis way, Westron (which also became known as the Common Speech) became\nthe everyday language of most of the inhabitants of the realms,\nincluding later immigrants such as the Shire-folk; and even other nearby\nindependent kingdoms and peoples, who had languages of their own, chose\nWestron for their dealings with foreigners, so that it became the\nlanguage of trade and diplomacy throughout the West. The Westron was\narguably the most enduring cultural legacy of the Realms in Exile.\n\n\nHistory\n\nSecond Age\n\nArnor and Gondor were founded in SA 3320, the year after the Akallabêth.\nHowever, Sauron, who hated Elendil and his family on account of their\nfriendship with the Elves and their opposition to his policies in\nNúmenor, had survived Númenor's downfall, in which he played a leading\npart. He returned to Middle-earth, and discovered that the power of the\nElves under Gil-galad had increased in his absence, and that the Realms\nin Exile, whose territory extended even to the borders of Mordor, were\ninclined to side with the Elves in the event of war. Thus, after a\nmostly peaceful century in which Elendil ruled in the north and Isildur\nand Anárion in the south, Sauron suddenly attacked Gondor (SA 3429),\ncapturing Minas Ithil and destroying its White Tree. Isildur fled to\nArnor, while Anárion defended Osgiliath and Minas Anor. In 3430,\nGil-galad and Elendil formed the Last Alliance, initially consisting of\nthe Realms in Exile and the Elf-kingdoms of Lindon and Imladris. The\nAlliance was soon joined by the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm and the Silvan\nElves of Mirkwood and Lórien. The Allies overthrew Sauron's forces at\nthe Battle of Dagorlad, and besieged Barad-dûr for seven years; Anárion,\nalong with many others, was killed during the siege. At last, seeing no\nother way to break the siege, Sauron himself came forth, and wrestled\nwith Elendil and Gil-galad on the slopes of Mount Doom; they defeated\nhim, but both perished. Isildur cut Sauron's ring of power from his hand\nand took it for his own. Sauron passed away into the shadows and the\nSecond Age ended.\n\nThird Age\n\nWith both Elendil and Anárion dead, the organisation of the Realms in\nExile became murky. Isildur became sole King of both Gondor and Arnor,\nbut instead of seeking to rule both Kingdoms personally, he instructed\nhis nephew Meneldil, the oldest surviving son of Anárion, before making\nhim responsible for ruling Gondor. Isildur, along with his three eldest\nsons (Elendur, Aratan and Ciryon), then journeyed north, Isildur\nintending to take up the high kingship of his father in Arnor. Some two\nthousand years later, Arvedui (Isildur's remote descendant in the north)\nand the Dúnedain of Gondor disagreed as to whether Isildur relinquished\nhis rights in Gondor, or whether he merely made Meneldil responsible for\nruling Gondor under his suzerainty.\n\nWhatever Isildur's plans, they were put to a sudden end when he and his\nthree eldest sons were killed in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields. In\nthat unexpected attack by Orcs, most of Isildur's followers were killed;\nhe himself escaped, taking advantage of the Ring's power of\ninvisibility, but the Orcs tracked him to the Anduin. When he tried to\nswim across the river, the Ring slipped from his finger, and the Orcs\nsaw him and killed him with arrows. Of his entire army and entourage as\nhe journeyed north, only three eventually reached Arnor; among these was\nhis esquire, who had kept the shards of Elendil's famous sword Narsil.\nThat sword then became an heirloom of the Kingdom of Arnor.\n\nThe sceptre of Arnor now came to Valandil, the youngest of Isildur's\nfour sons, who had remained in Rivendell during the war, being still a\nchild when the Last Alliance attacked Sauron; but not until TA 10 did he\nactually assume his responsibilities. By this time, whatever Isildur's\noriginal intentions were, Meneldil in Gondor was a thoroughly\nindependent monarch, and Valandil and his successors in Arnor, badly\nweakened by Arnor's losses in the war, were in no position to exert\nauthority over Gondor, even if they had wished to do so. So it was that,\nin place of the unified entity of Elendil's day, two independent\nkingdoms arose.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that Arnor, despite its notional superiority,\nwas by now the weaker of the two realms. Although its territory\nencompassed almost all of vast Eriador, its population was severely\ndiminished and it never really recovered. In TA 861, Arnor was divided\ninto the three petty kingdoms of Arthedain, Rhudaur and Cardolan, which\nfrequently fought amongst themselves, weakening the northern Dúnedain\nstill further. About TA 1300, an evil power known as the Witch-king\nestablished the kingdom of Angmar in the mountainous wastes north of\nArthedain and Rhudaur, and proceeded to conquer the realms of the\nnorthern Dúnedain one by one. In Rhudaur, power was seized from the\nDúnedain in the 14th century by the native Hillmen, who allied\nthemselves with Angmar before eventually being annexed early in the 15th\ncentury. Cardolan was fatally weakened by a defeat at the hands of the\ncombined forces of Angmar and Rhudaur in TA 1409, and its few surviving\nDúnedain, along with most of its other inhabitants, were eventually\nwiped out in the Great Plague of TA 1636. Arthedain, the most powerful\nof the northern kingdoms and the only one in which the line of Isildur\nwas preserved, survived the longest, eventually falling to an all-out\ninvasion from Angmar in TA 1974. After the collapse of Arthedain, the\nsurviving Dúnedain became a wandering people, and secretly guarded\nEriador's few surviving settled communities, such as the Shire and Bree,\nagainst evil and wild creatures.\n\nIn the south, Gondor grew and flourished for a thousand years, gaining\nterritory to the north-east (southern Rhovanion), the north-west\n(Enedwaith) and the south (Umbar). It seems Gondor never sought to\nexpand further northwest than the Greyflood, and no records survive of\nconflict between Gondor and unified Arnor, or between Gondor and\nCardolan. But nor are there any records of alliance or friendly\ncommunication; Gondor seems rather to have been preoccupied with the\npeoples to its east and south, and with the threat of Mordor, which\nGondor guarded with a series of fortresses. Thus Gondor came to control\na vast territory by the time of Hyarmendacil I, but like Arnor it slowly\ndecayed through a combination of internal weaknesses and external\nthreats. Its Dúnedain population slowly shrank, the southern Dúnedain\ntending to marry late and have few children, so that Gondor gradually\nlost its main source of strength compared to the surrounding nations.\nDuring the second millennium of the Third Age, Gondor was hit by three\ngreat calamities. The first was the Kin-strife, a civil war brought\nabout by the marriage of King Valacar to a foreign woman and the\naccession of their son; during the Kin-strife, the Dúnedain aristocracy\nwas decimated, the great _palantír_ of Osgiliath lost, and Umbar was\nwrested from Gondor by the survivors of the rebel faction. The second,\nthe Great Plague that wreaked havoc in Cardolan (see above), had earlier\nkilled great numbers of the people of Gondor. The third calamity, a\ncentury-long war with the Wainriders, cost Gondor its eastern\nterritories and nearly exterminated the royal family.\n\nIn light of the threats of Angmar and the Wainriders, Gondor and\nArthedain made an alliance in TA 1940, the first such alliance for many\ncenturies, and cemented it by the marriage of Arvedui, heir to the\nthrone of Arthedain, and Fíriel, daughter of Ondoher of Gondor. When\nOndoher and his two sons were killed in battle with the Wainriders four\nyears later, Arvedui claimed the now vacant throne of Gondor, by virtue\nof his descent from Isildur and secondarily in right of his wife. Had\nhis claim been accepted, it seems likely that a Reunited Kingdom would\nhave emerged far earlier, and to the advantage of both North and South.\nBut the Council of Gondor, perhaps offended by his assertion of the\nrights of Isildur's descendants in Gondor, and certainly seeing the\nnorthern prince as a weak candidate, instead offered the crown to\nEärnil, the general responsible for victory over the Wainriders and a\ndistant cousin of Gondor's late King. Despite the obvious snub the\nCouncil thus offered to the northern Dúnedain, Eärnil II maintained\nGondor's alliance with Arthedain, going so far as to send an\nexpeditionary force north to help Arvedui (who had by then succeeded his\nfather) against Angmar; but that fleet arrived too late to save\nArthedain, instead providing the bulk of the forces that would smash\nAngmar at Fornost. In that encounter, Eärnur, Eärnil's son and eventual\nsuccessor, was personally humiliated by the Witch-king. When therefore\nthe Nazgûl had conquered Minas Ithil (TA 2002), and Eärnur succeeded his\nfather, the Witch-king, appealing to his pride, challenged him to single\ncombat; he rode to the gates of Minas Morgul (as Minas Ithil had been\nrenamed) with a small retinue and was never seen or heard from again.\n\nThus, within two generations of the Dúnedain, both Arnor and Gondor lost\ntheir kings. The northern Dúnedain were too weak to maintain a kingdom,\nand so their leaders, the successors of Isildur, took the humble title,\n“Chieftain of the Dúnedain”. In the south, by contrast, Gondor was still\na viable state, but the male-line descendants of Anárion were all but\nextinct. Unlike Rhudaur and Cardolan in the north, the Dúnedain of\nGondor refused to look for a king outside the royal family, so power was\nexercised in the name of the king by 26 successive Ruling Stewards, the\nfirst of whom was Mardil the Steadfast. By the time of the later\nStewards, Sauron's forces were constantly encroaching on Gondor's\nborders, and several more territories were ceded to allies or conquered\nby enemies: Calenardhon in the 26th century, and Ithilien, Gondor's sole\nremaining province east of the Anduin, in the 30th. In the War of the\nRing, Sauron sought to smash Gondor, his strongest opponent, but forces\nfrom Gondor and other nations beat his armies back in the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields. During that battle, Aragorn II, the Chieftain of the\nDúnedain of the North, and thus a descendant of both Isildur and\nAnárion, distinguished himself by arriving with a strong relief army at\nthe critical moment, and was acclaimed by the people of Gondor as King;\nhis only notable opponent within Gondor's ruling classes, Ruling Steward\nDenethor II, was driven mad and committed suicide on the day of the\nbattle. Thus, after Sauron was defeated by the destruction of his Ring,\nAragorn was crowned King of Gondor and received the sceptre of the Kings\nof Arnor, becoming the first King of the Reunited Kingdom."

    "text": "THORIN AND COMPANY were a group of thirteen Dwarves, the Wizard Gandalf,\nand the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, led by Thorin Oakenshield in TA 2941.\nTheir main purpose was to regain the lost Dwarven kingdom of the Lonely\nMountain from the Dragon Smaug.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nThe formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin\nin Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost\nfamily inheritance. Remembering that he had once known an adventurous\nHobbit on his travels in The Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to\ntheir company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable\nto force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the\nsometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The\nsuperstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number,\nand as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a\nfourteenth to fill in to their party.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nFormation of Thorin and Company\n\nOn the April 26, 2941, Gandalf and the Dwarves arrived at Bag End. After\nbig tea and supper with Bilbo, they explained themselves and their\nintentions. Bilbo was at first reluctant to join the group but Gandalf\nrushed him out of the door.\n\nTravels and Encounters\n\nAfter traveling for some time and crossing the river Hoarwell, the\ncompany were caught and nearly killed and eaten by three hungry trolls.\nGandalf returned in time to keep the monsters occupied until dawn, when\nthe light of the Sun turned them to stone. Recovering themselves, the\nDwarves found that these Trolls had a cave nearby filled with stolen\nweapons, food, and a small treasure. Amongst the many weapons were Sting\n(which Bilbo armed himself with, and which he named after a battle with\na giant spider), Orcrist (claimed by Thorin), and Glamdring (taken by\nGandalf). Strangely, all were ancient Elvish blades that had been forged\nseveral millennia earlier, in the First Age, in Gondolin.\n\n\n\nReaching Rivendell in June, the company held talks with Elrond and\nlearned about the secret Moon-letters on Thorin’s old map of the Lonely\nMountain. Elrond also read the runes on Orcrist and Glamdring, thus\nidentifying them. After spending a short time there, the group resumed\ntheir journey through the Misty Mountains.\n\nOn their way through the High Pass, the company (minus Gandalf) were\ncaptured by goblins. Taken before the Great Goblin, they were in mortal\ndanger. Gandalf suddenly appeared and killed the Great Goblin, creating\nenough disarray for them to escape. Unfortunately, Bilbo fell down a\nhole and was left behind during their hasty retreat. Wandering lost and\nalone in the depths of the mountain, he found the One Ring and met\nGollum, described in _The Hobbit_ as “a small slimy creature … as dark\nas darkness, except for two big round pale eyes in his thin face.”\n\nAfter a hazardous game of Riddles with the creature, Bilbo fortuitously\ndiscovered the ring he had found could make him invisible. Wearing the\nring, Bilbo escaped Gollum and a group of goblins guarding the eastern\ndoor out of the caverns, and soon reunited with his companions.\nCollecting themselves, the company made their way down the mountainside,\nwhere they were attacked by Wargs and forced to seek refuge in the\ntrees. Goblins soon arrived and tried to kill the company by getting\nthem down on the ground by tampering down the trees. With all hope\nnearly gone, the hapless company were rescued by a group of giant\nEagles.\n\nAfter thanking the Eagles, Thorin and Company made for Beorn's house\nwhere they managed to impress the wary shape-changer. Fully stocked and\nprepared the Company, they left Beorn's home and made for Mirkwood. When\nthey reached the edge of the perilous wood, Gandalf announced that he\nhad pressing business elsewhere and would not be coming with them\nthrough the forest. Grumbling, they went on ahead, taking the Forest\nPath into the darkness of Mirkwood. After a few days they reached a dark\nstream which Beorn had warned them not to drink or bathe in, for it was\nenchanted and caused great drowsiness and forgetfulness. They were able\nto cross it, but Bombur fell in. By the time they fished him out he was\nalready asleep and had to be carried by the rest of the company.\n\nEventually they reached a point where they were practically out of food\nand tried to beg from a group of feasting Wood-elves. Thorin was\ncaptured by these Elves, while the remaining company, with the exception\nof Bilbo, were snared by Giant Spiders. Bilbo rescued them with the help\nof his magic ring, but they were soon captured by the angry Elves and\nimprisoned by their king.\n\nWith the aid of the ring, Bilbo eluded the Dwarves' captors. Weeks\nlater, he found a way to free them. Hiding in empty wine barrels, the\ncompany made their way down the river to Lake-town. There they were fed\nand clothed with the hope that they would defeat Smaug and regain\nprosperity for the region.\n\nThey reached the mountain after a few days and tried to locate the\nSecret door described on the map. They found it with the help of a\nThrush. Thorin decided to have Bilbo enter the mountain and “burgle”\nsomething. This the hobbit did, and even had a conversation with the\nmighty Smaug (while wearing the Ring, so that he could not be seen). But\nthe enraged Dragon soon emerged and attacked Lake-town, leaving Thorin\nand Company free to enter the mountain. Meanwhile the dragon was slain\nby Bard of Lake-town, but the town suffered great loss and destruction.\nThe Dwarves remained inside the mountain until an army of Lake-men, and\nlater Wood-elves, led by the Elven-king, arrived seeking a share of the\ntreasure to compensate them for their losses. Thorin refused, and the\nDwarves were besieged within the mountain. They called for aid from\ntheir kin in the Iron Hills (a range to the east of The Lonely\nMountain).\n\nThe Battle of Five Armies and the Dissolving of the Company\n\n\n\nJust before they were about to fight the Elves, the company were joined\nby an army of Dwarves from the Iron Hills. Then Gandalf arrived, just in\ntime to inform them that an army of goblins and Wargs were coming to\nattack. The battle began and Thorin and Company went to war. Bilbo\nstayed out of the battle with the aid of the Ring. The enemy had the\nupper hand until the arrival of the eagles and Beorn. The company and\ntheir allies won but Fíli and Kíli had been killed and Thorin was\nmortally wounded. Bilbo bade farewell to Thorin as he lay dying, and\nthen left with Gandalf and a modest share of the treasure.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe deeds of Thorin and Company led to the restoration of the Dwarven\nKingdom of the Lonely Mountain and the Dwarven dynasty in the Lonely\nMountain, the Kingdom of Dale, the rebuilding of Lake-town, and\nrestoration of peace and prosperity in the immediate area for many\nyears. In the long term, the journey of Thorin and Company and the\nsituations it created led to the Council of Elrond and the formation of\nthe Fellowship of the Ring many years later and played a major part in\nthe starting of The War of the Ring.\n\nIt also depleted the forces of evil so that later Sauron would have less\nto call upon during the War of the Ring. Gloin's son, Gimli, would later\nbe a member of the Fellowship as well, contributing his axe to their\nultimate victory. Additionally, Bilbo's finding of the ring would bring\nit into the care of Frodo, who would one day bring it to its\ndestruction.\n\n\nMembers\n\n-   Thorin II Oakenshield (leader) \n-   Fíli\n-   Kíli\n-   Óin\n-   Glóin\n-   Balin\n-   Dwalin\n-   Ori\n-   Dori\n-   Nori\n-   Bifur\n-   Bofur\n-   Bombur\n-   Bilbo Baggins\n-   Gandalf\n\n  Name      Age (TA 2941)\n  --------- ------------------------\n  Thorin    195\n  Fili      82\n  Kili      77\n  Oín       167\n  Glóin     158\n  Balin     178 (book) 216 (movie)\n  Dwalin    169\n  Ori       76 (movie)\n  Dori      114\n  Nori      104\n  Bifur     127\n  Bofur     98\n  Bombur    107\n  Bilbo     50\n  Gandalf   5000+\n\n  : Age of the Members of the Company",

Much of this story was later\ninfluenced the details of the similar _The Notion Club Papers_ (with at\nleast one of the characters referencing the general events of the _The\nLost Road_).\n\n    I began an abortive book of time-travel of which the end was to be\n    the presence of my hero in the drowning of Atlantis. This was to be\n    called Númenor, the Land in the West. The thread was to be the\n    occurrence time and again in human families (like Durin among the\n    Dwarves) of a father and son called by names that could be\n    interpreted as Bliss-friend and Elf-friend. ..... It started with a\n    father-son affinity between Edwin and Elwin of the present, and was\n    supposed to go back into legendary time by way of an Eädwine and\n    Ælfwine of circa A.D. 918, and Audoin and Alboin of Lombardic\n    legend, and so to the traditions of the North Sea concerning the\n    coming of corn and culture heroes, ancestors of kingly lines, in\n    boats (and their departure in funeral ships). ..... In my tale we\n    were to come at last to Amandil and Elendil leaders of the loyal\n    party in Númenor, when it fell under the domination of Sauron.\n\nThe importance of the story is that it was one of the earliest\nintroductions to the story of the fall of Numenor.\n\nThe book's title is a reference to the Straight Road (which is also\nknown as the Lost Road or the Straight Path)"

Aman was\nremoved from the circles of the world and the seas bent so that no man\ncould ever find the Undying Lands ever again. In place of Aman these New\nLands were created in the west.\n\nSometime at the end of the Second Age (between the Akallabêth and the\nWar of the Last Alliance), they were discovered by the great mariners of\nthe Dúnedain living in Middle-earth yearning for the west or searching\nfor the Isle of Meneltarma.

It was close to the Great Goblin's cavern by following an\nestimated thirty miles of long, dark, and narrow tunnel.\n\nThe cave housed a small subterranean lake of ice cold water in which sat\na tiny island which supplied Gollum with a small amount of protection\nfrom the nearby Goblin Camp.

Following the flow of an\nunderground stream, he made his way to a dark cave and made his home\nthere.  He soon found out that Goblins were living close by and used the\nnetwork of tunnels adjoining his. When he felt bold and hungry enough,\nGollum, using his magic ring to become invisible, throttled them and ate\nthem.\n\nIn TA 2941, Bilbo Baggins and his company of Dwarves were journeying\nthrough the Misty Mountains and were taken by surprise as a group of\ngoblins jumped upon them, causing a great mass of confusion amongst the\nDwarves. During their escape from Goblin-town, Bilbo would then have to\nfend for himself after falling and being missed in the darkness. He soon\nstumbled upon this cave after finding the One Ring and subsequently met\nGollum. Gollum, afraid of Bilbo's Elvish dagger, didn't attack as he\nnormally would have done. Instead, he spoke to Bilbo and ended up taking\npart in a game of riddles with the hobbit. If Gollum won, he would kill\nand eat Bilbo, and if Bilbo won, Gollum would show him the way out.\nAfter Gollum lost the riddle-game and discovered the loss of the Ring,\nhe became enraged and tried to kill Bilbo. However, Bilbo put on the\nRing and used it to follow Gollum to the exit of the cave.\n\nAfter Bilbo's escape with the Ring, Gollum remained in the cave for a\nlong time. However, he eventually left and wandered Middle-earth, trying\nto find Bilbo and reclaim his One Ring for himself once again."

It ran between Minas Tirith and the Fords\nof Isen in the Gap of Rohan, where it joined the North-South Road to\nArnor. The Great West Road was approximately 425 miles long.\n\nAt its far eastern end, the Great West Road met the North-way which came\nfrom Minas Tirith through Forannest, the North-gate of the Rammas Echor.\nThe Great West Road then curved around Amon Dîn and ran westward through\nAnorien. The Road skirted the edge of the Drúadan Forest and passed the\nBeacon-hills of Gondor at the foot of the White Mountains.\n\nThe Great West Road ran through the edge of the Firien wood to avoid the\nmarshy land north of the forest. A path marked by a standing stone\nbranched southward off the Road to Halifirien, the last of the\nBeacon-hills. At the western edge of the Firien Wood, the Great West\nRoad crossed a bridge over the Mering Stream, which was the border\nbetween Gondor and Rohan.\n\nIn Rohan, the Great West Road passed through the Fenmarch and the\nregions of the Eastfold and the Folde. The Road traversed the Snowbourn\nby way of a ford near Edoras, and a track branched off to the city.\nFurther on, the Deeping-road branched off into the Deeping Coomb where\nHelm's Deep was located.\n\nThe Great West Road then curved northwestward for a ways. About two\nmiles before the Fords of Isen there was a sharp westward turn and the\nRoad ran straight down to the riverbank. On the other side of the Isen,\nthe North-South Road began. A branch road led north to Isengard.\n\nIn the early days of Gondor, the Great West Road and the North-South\nRoad formed a single Royal Road between the two Kingdoms of the\nDunedain. At that time, the region between the Mering Stream and the\nFords of Isen was a province of Gondor called Calenardhon. In TA 2510,\nthat land became Rohan and the Rohirrim were responsible for maintaining\nthe stretch of the Great West Road that ran through their land.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, an army from Mordor crossed the Anduin into\nAnorien and blocked the Great West Road. They dug trenches and erected\nstakes in the roadway with the purpose of preventing the Rohirrim from\ncoming to Minas Tirith. But Ghan-buri-Ghan led the Rohirrim by a\nforgotten way through the Stonewain Valley and avoided the enemy forces.\nThe Rohirrim arrived at dawn on March 15, TA 3019, and helped win the\nBattle of the Pelennor Fields.\n\nNames and Etymology Also referred to as the '''West Road '''as well as\nthe HORSE-ROAD and the HORSE-MEN'S ROAD.\n\nThe North-South Road and the Great West Road were collectively called\nthe ROYAL ROAD or the GREAT ROAD.

    "text": "COMMON BEVERAGES IN MIDDLE EARTH refers to what people generally prefer\nto drink on a regular basis.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThere are many types of drinks in Middle-earth. Some are preferred by\nMen, some by Hobbits, and still more by Dwarves, Elves, and Orcs. Let us\nstart with Men and Hobbits.\n\nMen, as well as Hobbits, are big Inn and Pub dwellers, and therefore\nlove a good drink. At the famous Prancing Pony Inn, located in Bree, a\nparticularly loved beverage is Barliman's Best, a very good ale served\nin pints, for Men are used to a beverage normally served in that\nquantity. However, Hobbits find it a rare treat to be served a pint, for\ntheir small body weight accounts for their limited serving size.\nTherefore, some travelling Hobbits that venture into Big Folk territory\nlove to order from any drink selection that comes their way. Other types\nof drinks that Men and Hobbits prefer that are not signature labeled\nlike Barliman's Best would include all types of beer and wine, and\nsometimes mead.\n\nAnother well known wine comes from the lake city of Lake-town, located\nsouth of Dale near the Lonely Mountain, east of Mirkwood. This city was\nfull of various merchants, and a prime trade was the selling of\nLake-town's fine wine, which was so good that even the Elves of Mirkwood\nput forth effort in obtaining it for their feasts and celebrations. This\nwine was floated back and forth in barrels between the Lake City and the\nElven kingdom in Mirkwood by use of a river for years.\n\nDwarves are especially fond of their drink, having been based on the\nNorse. To them, a day without a drink is a day not fully completed.\nDwarves prefer mead, but will just as soon accept any type of beer, just\nlike Men and Hobbits. Wine is not usually seen as a common Dwarf\nbeverage, for Dwarves are not depicted ever drinking it. However, based\non their common love for any alcoholic drink, one can assume that\nDwarves would not hesitate to drink a few goblets from this grape\nextract.\n\nElves are lovers of wine. As stated, the Elves of Mirkwood get all of\ntheir wine from the lake city of Lake-town, and there is never a\ndecrease in demand for it. Likewise, all other Elves of Middle-earth are\nnot easily parted from their various types of local wine. Travelers that\ncome upon their feasts will see that after the wine has been passed\naround for a while, a dramatic change in the general merry making\noccurs. When offered other types of alcoholic beverages, such as beer,\nElves are not known to decline, for they seem to accept all forms of\nalcohol. It is even said that an Elf could best a Dwarf in a drinking\ncontest, regardless of the type of drink.\n\nOrcs are only known to drink draught (or grog as it's commonly called),\nbut that's not to say that an orc isn't willing to consume whatever they\npillage. It's unknown what exactly draught is made of, but based on the\ntypical orc diet it can be suspected to have been brewed from flesh or\nblood, along with some sort of alcohol. Whatever it's made from, it's\ncertainly cause for the spectacular explosions that occur whenever\ndraught is ignited. It can also be described as being vile and\nfoul-smelling, but to an orc, anyone who hosts a feast without the drink\nwould be flogged until dead. In practical forms, draught is used as a\nliquid reserve for long trips in the stead of water and as a medicine.\nThe healing potency of draught is reflective of the orcs' ancestry with\nthe elves, able to scab over wounds within hours.\n"

In the\nbroadest sense, _Telerin_ refers to any tongue of Elves that were of\nLindar origin.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of speakers of Quenya, Telerin was a closely related\nlanguage still largely intelligible.

After being presented to his grieving (and insane) father, it\nwas buried with him.\n\n\nDescription\n\nAccording to Appendix A of the Lord of the Rings, the Kine of Araw were\nfar larger and splendid than common, earthly cattle (like Old Bessie).\nTheir hides were a gleaming pallid white that reflected the sun rising\nfrom the Gates of Morning in the East.\n\nThe horns attached to their gargantuan bodies were colossal in size,\ngiving the kine an air of grandeur. While nobody knows what the kine\nreally looked like, their size and scant description that we possess may\ngive them an appearance similar to the real-life Texas Longhorn.\n\nThere are certain parallels between the Kine and the real-world Aurochs.\nThe Aurochs is considered to be the ancestor of modern cattle; they were\nlarge, dangerous animals with great horns living across North Africa,\nEurope, and most of Asia. The Aurochs was driven to extinction in the\n1600s by heavy hunting, especially by royal families across Europe.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n'''Kine '''is a rather archaic English word, meaning “cattle.” As\nTolkien was deeply fluent in Old English, Welsh, and Scottish, he would\nhave used the term rather than a more modern one to better suit the\nmedieval feel of the _Lord of the Rings._\n\nLikewise, '''Araw '''is the Sindarin form of Oromë, which is a term from\nQuenya. The full term denotes and explains the beasts' heritage and\nhistory."

For Angmar, that most evil of realms in Eriador, was located\njust north of the North Downs, and many evil beings who were struggling\nto find a purpose in Angmar after the departure of the Witch-king\nfinally resolved to invade the lands south of them. Thus, the North\nDowns became a frontier against this new evil arisen in Angmar, a\nremnant of the old power of the Witch King called the Shadow of Angmar.\n\nThere was still hope though, in that harsh war zone, for the Free\nPeoples of Eriador waged constant war on the new servants of Angmar and\nthe Witch King. Several towns that had existed in that area for years,\nand that were now besieged by the servants of the Witch King, found\nthemselves suddenly strengthened by a flow of warriors from all across\nEriador."

It is also possible that, like Giants and\nthe term “Fairy”, they were simply dropped as Tolkien expanded\nMiddle-earth and the related cosmology.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn the earlier legends of Middle-earth written before the release of the\nHobbit (but which elements of the Hobbit were roughly based on) the\nogres were one of the Úvanimor; the monsters, giants, and ogres (and\nlater Wicked dwarves) who were bred from earth by Melkor. They feared\nthe sinews of Tulkas arm and his iron-clad fists, when he had cause for\nwrath. It is said that Túvo protected Men and Elves from them and from\n‘evil fays’, and the Orcs besides. Among the ogres were the Sarqindi,\nthe Cannibal-ogres.\n\nHúrin once fought beside Beren against “ogres and Orcs and evil\nfoemen”.\n\nGothmog was a son of Melkor and the ogress Fuiluthin and his name is\nStrife-and-hatred, and he was Captain of the Balrogs and lord of\nMelkor's hosts ere fair Ecthelion slew him at the taking of Gondolin.\n\nVoronwë and Eärendil set sail in Vingilot and were driven south to the\ndark regions where the fire mountains were.

The great island of Númenor itself\nwas destroyed and fell beneath the waves of the tumultuous sea, becoming\n“Atalantë” (The Downfallen). The land of Aman and the island of Tol\nEressëa were removed from the Circles of the World forever, and could be\nreached only by Elves sailing West out of Middle-earth, following the\nStraight Road.\n\nThe world from then on was round as the seas and the lands bent back\nupon themselves.

Used mostly for jewelry and ship's\nfittings (corrosion-resistant), though armor and weapons can be made\nfrom the metal. True bronzes are rare today; the Copper/Zinc alloy Brass\nbeing more commonly produced. Alone, Bronze's two components are fairly\nweak, but when smelted together became a strong, corrosion resistant\nalloy that was useful in nearly every field of metalworking, from\nweapons and armor, to tools, to rings and other jewelry.\n\nIt is most likely that the first discoverer and user of the copper/tin\nalloy was Aulë who probably passed the technique down to his creations,\nthe Dwarves. The great smithies of the stocky mountain dwellers would\nhave certainly forged armor and various bronze tools and weapons,\nsurpassed in quality only by the Elves and the Valar themselves.\nHowever, eventually came the dawn of man; And with him came all of his\ninventiveness and ability to adopt the creations around him. Soon, the\nforges and armorers of the Kingdoms of Man also began to adapt and\nchange the Dwarven designs, making suitable creations for humans.\n\nUse of the Alloy fell greatly after the fall of Sauron, when many of the\ngreat human kingdoms died out, in many cases the old skills and secrets\nof the past died with their users. In many parts of Middle-Earth,\ndeclining reserves of copper caused a heavy spike in the cost of\nobtaining the metal. Also, the discovery and utilization of Iron and\nSteel as far easier and cheaper alternatives were the killing blows to\nthe use of Bronze at its past greatness. However, use of the alloy never\ncompletely phased out, many of the land's factions and kingdoms still\nmade use of it. Rhûn in the east, for example used Bronze as a primary\narmor material all the way to at least the end of the Third Age.\n\n\nUsage in Middle-Earth\n\nElves\n\nThe Elves of Gondolin constructed a Gate of Bronze which was the third\nof the Seven Gates of Gondolin.\n\nGondor and Rohan\n\nIn the large kingdom of Gondor, Steel plating and Iron were generally\nfavored over Bronze, though some soldiers were known to wear shirts of\nBronze chainmail. The chest, flank and facial armor of most Gondor\nCavalry was forged bronze. The old, Norse like kingdom of Rohan made\ngood use of the Alloy. Small short plates of bronze were worn on and\nunder chainmail and leather armor. the breastplates, helms, and other\narmor of the Rohirrim and the horse armor of their cavalry was thick\nbronze. Rohirrum swords and spears and arrowheads were commonly bronze.\n\nMordor\n\nThe combination of poor ore deposits, even worse craftmanship, and the\nmassive needs of its Orc armies caused bronze to be rare and far flung\nbetween. The Volcanic mines were the wrong environment for the formation\nof usable copper and tin, the massive forges and foundries were designed\nwith quantity, not quality in mind and were woefully incapable of\nprocessing and shaping the good metal without completely annihilating\nany trace of its individuality. Though the Orc smiths were not minded\nenough in their craft to create bronze armor of their own, they had no\nqualms about looting existing pieces and utilizing it (often badly\nfitting) and many an orc captain wore a battered helm, a dented shield,\nor a bronze sword, looted from an enemy.\n\nDwarf Clans\n\nRhûnic Kingdoms\n\nThroughout the ages, at least until the end of Third Age, Rhûnic\nKingdoms used bronze as the main metal in their armors and weapons.",

    "title": "Elven Weapons and Armour",
    "page_id": "12526",
    "text": "Elven Weapons\n\nThroughout their existence, Elves have been masters of making and using\nweapons and arms. Their skill at forging weapons and armor surpasses the\nrace of Men, but not the skill of the race of Dwarves. Tolkien writes:\n“In the tempering of steel alone of all crafts the Dwarves were never\noutmatched even by the Noldor, and in the making of mail  their\nwork had no rival.”\n\nEven more renowned is the Elven skill at using their fine weapons, be it\nbow or blade. The purpose of this article is to explain the type of\nweapons the Elves have used and what effect these weapons have had in\npast wars and battles. The article is not extensive, and covers only the\nmost basic of Elven weapons. \n\nSword\n\nThe Elven sword is used frequently by standard Elven warriors and it\ncomes in different forms. Apart from notable Elven blades such as\nAnglachel (wielded by Beleg Cúthalion and Turin Turambar, as well as\nbeing forged by Eol, the Dark Elf) , Glamdring (wielded by Gandalf), and\nOrcrist (used by Thorin Oakenshield), many more fierce swords have\nserved their handlers well in battle and have no title.\n\nA clue to what the earliest of the Elven blades were made of lies in a\ndescription of the first Orcs who attacked the Laegrim Elves in\nBeleriand. Apparently, these Orcs were equipped with steel weapons which\ngave them the edge over their Elven counterparts. Therefore, Elven\nweapons at that time were not in existence or were made of a weaker\nmaterial than steel. When the use of steel weaponry came upon the Elves\nin Valinor, most notably the Noldor, when Morgoth spoke to them\nconcerning weapons, a great change in the style of weaponmaking came\nabout, likely including the creation of the sword, due especially to\nsuperior Noldorin metallurgy.\n\n\n\nSting, the shortsword used by the Hobbits Bilbo and Frodo, is an example\nof Elven blades at their peak. Being able to glow blue when orcs and\ngoblins are near, Sting shows how Elven blades grew to have properties\nunknown to mortals. Even the black sword Anglachel is said to have\nspoken to Turin before it aided him in his suicide. Thus, Elven blades\nbecame renowned as great weapons, capable of performing deeds beyond the\nskill of their handlers and were even more glorious when the use of\nMithril was allowed to the Elves.\n\nBow\n\nElves mastered both the construction and uses of the bow, developing the\nstandard longbow and creating different variations of it. None were more\nskilled with the longbow than the Silvan Elves and most notable of those\nwere the Galadhrim, the wardens of Lothlórien, the Golden Wood. Some,\nwho became true masters of this weapon, were renown as skilled marksmen\nin several wars, the most famous being Legolas Greenleaf and Beleg\nCúthalion.\n\nElven arrows are not elaborately recorded and so the reader does not\nhave a wide variety of knowledge on the subject, though certain arrows\nwere dear to their owners, such as Dailir was to Beleg.\n\n\nElven Armour and Shields\n\nThe armour of the Elves has evolved throughout their days in Arda, but\nhas always been well made and of the highest quality, the only rival to\nit being Dwarf-made armor which is the finest to ever grace\nMiddle-Earth. Again, not much is said regarding Elven armor only that it\nis bright and beautiful to look upon. Much of Elven armour is derived\nfrom the early Dwarf designs, for the two races have great influence\nupon one another.\n\nThe earliest Elven armour was made by the Dwarves, and appears to have\nbeen scale armor, eventually superseded by mail of rings. Scale and\nchainmail were the armors used throughout the First Age, and appear to\nhave never been replaced. Thus, the armies of the Last Alliance likely\nwore the same mail worn by their ancestors millennia prior. Gil-galad\nhimself is said to have worn mail made of silver. Lastly, regarding\nSilvan Elves, the armor in which these forest dwellers were clad in\nconsisted mostly of leather and offered minimal protection,\n\nShields were also used by the Elves and highly decorated in Elf-fashion,\nlike their armour. The shields used by Elves appear to have been of much\nhigher-quality than the shields of Men--Tuor found himself a long kite\nshield, made of wood but plated with steel. Elves of high rank used\nshields decked with crystal."

    "page_id": "12543",
    "text": "History\n\nThroughout their existence, the so-called Naugrim, or Dwarves, have been\nexperts at making and using various weaponry, with no equal. This skill\ncomes from the Vala Aulë the Smith, who crafted the Dwarves at the\nbeginning of Arda. The list of common Dwarven weaponry goes on and on,\nand from their very origin each type, including bows, swords, axes, and\nmattocks, have retained a unique Dwarven identity and respect among\nother cultures.\n\n\nWeaponry\n\nAxe\n\n The Dwarven axe is the most famous and likely the most common weapon\nfor any Dwarf soldier. Used extensively throughout the wars fought by\nDwarves, the axe probably came into use by the time Khazad-dûm was\nfounded, somewhere in the Ages of Stars. The idea of the use of the axe\nis to drive forward while attacking; therefore, it is not good in\ndefense. Being a weapon that is hard to control, the axe takes great\nskill to master, which shows the skill and temperament the Dwarves have\nin warfare.\n\nSword\n\nThe Dwarven sword is less commonly wielded than the axe. Yet, certain\nfamous Dwarven figures have wielded this weapon to great effect. The\nwarriors of the Iron Hills carried a broad shortsword as a sidearm.\n\nMattock\n\nThe war-pick was the favored weapon of the Dwarves of the Iron Hills.\nTheir skill with them appears to have been well-known, for in most\ninstances where they are mentioned, their mattocks are named as well.\n\nBow\n\nThough not commonly associated with the Khazad, it appears bows were\nutilized by them as well. Thorin and company used bows given to them by\nBeorn in Mirkwood, and Thorin was the only dwarf of the company to hit\nthe stag they saw, implying skill with a bow. Thorin also scavenged a\nbow from the armories of Erebor, and used it to shoot at emissaries sent\nto negotiate with him.\n\n\nArmor\n\nPerhaps the Dwarves are best known for their armour above all other\nthings battle-related. Dwarf armor would be iron or steel chain-mail,\nwhich was invented and used by the Dwarves to great effect by the time\nof the Wars of Beleriand. Of course, iron or steel helms and shields\nwould accompany this chain-mail. Dwarven helmets are recorded to have\ncovered the face, with the use of a forged mask. This mask was\nparticularly helpful when fighting Dragons, as the face would be\nshielded from the flames, thanks to the expert craft of the Dwarves.\nLastly, with the use of Mithril, their armor changed more dramatically\nthan any other of their works did. Having such properties as to make\narrows bounce off, Mithril became an invaluable substance to the\nDwarves, so much, so that a single mail shirt could be “worth more than\nthe value of the Shire and everything in it”. However, the use of\nMithril in arms and armor became very limited after Orcs of the Misty\nMountains and the newly awakened Balrog of Morgoth overran the Dwarf\nmines of Khazad-dûm.\n\nDwarven shields are little-known, but the warriors of the Iron Hills\nwore a circular shield on their backs."

It was a\nplace of utmost fear and horror with brightly lit fires,\nhorrible-looking pillars that towered like trees boughs like serpents,\nand was filled with weapons and instruments of death and torture. Across\nthe hall stood a monstrous column and beneath it was the throne of\nMorgoth.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Nethermost Hall was possibly delved and raised when Angband was\nbuilt or when Morgoth returned there from Aman after stealing the\nSilmarils. As he rarely left Angband, Morgoth probably spent most of his\ntime here plotting his evils, torturing, and interrogating helpless\nprisoners. The Nethermost Hall was best known for being the place where\nBeren and Lúthien confronted Morgoth when he lost one of the Silmarils\nto Beren."

    "text": "The NORTH-SOUTH ROAD was part of the Royal Road linking Arnor and\nGondor. The North-South Road was approximately 600 miles long. It ran\nbetween Fornost in the north and Isengard in the south. At the Fords of\nIsen, the North-South Road merged with the Great West Road.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe northern half of the North-South Road was in Eriador. From Fornost,\nthe Road ran south to Bree. Outside the West-gate of Bree, the\nNorth-South Road intersected with the Great East Road. At this major\ncrossroads was the inn called The Prancing Pony, where travellers\nbrought news from the South as well as goods such as Pipe-weed, which\nfirst came to Bree and the Shire via the North-South Road.\n\nThe North-South Road then moved on through the narrow passage called the\nAndrath between the Barrow-downs and the South Downs. South of the\nAndrath, a road to the Shire branched off the North-South Road. The\nNorth-South Road then curved southeastward through the region of\nMinhiriath.\n\nAt the city of Tharbad, the Road crossed the River Greyflood on the\nsouthern border of Eriador. Originally, the Road went over the Bridge of\nTharbad. On either side of the Bridge, the Road was built up on\ncauseways to traverse the surrounding marshland. However, the Bridge was\ndestroyed by floods in TA 2912 and all that remained was a dangerous\nford.\n\nThe southern half of the North-South Road passed through Enedwaith,\nwhich at one time nominally belonged to Gondor but was essentially a\nborderland between Gondor and Arnor. East of the Road in Enedwaith was\nDunland at the foot of the Misty Mountains.\n\nAt the southern end of the Misty Mountains, the North-South Road curved\neastward through the Gap of Rohan and ended at the Fords of Isen. Just\nwest of the Fords a road branched north to Isengard. East of the Fords\nwas the Great West Road to Minas Tirith and Osgiliath.\n\nTogether the North-South Road and the Great West Road formed the Royal\nRoad, or Great Road, which was the main route by land between Gondor and\nArnor. The two Kingdoms were founded in 3320 of the Second Age. Each was\nresponsible for maintaining their own stretch of the Road, and together\nthey built and maintained the Bridge of Tharbad and its causeways.\n\nAfter the Great Plague of TA 1636, Gondor and Arnor were considerably\nweakened and could no longer keep the Road and Bridge in repair. The\nNorth-kingdom fell in TA 1974 and Fornost at the northern end of the\nNorth-South Road was abandoned. The causeways near Tharbad eventually\ndisintegrated and the marshes encroached on the Road. In the spring of\nTA 2912 after the Fell Winter, floods caused the Bridge to collapse.\n\nFewer and fewer travellers used the North-South Road and it became\novergrown with grass, so that the people of Bree called it the Greenway.\nHowever, during the War of the Ring at the end of the Third Age,\nunwelcome travellers began to come up the North-South Road from the\nSouth. Some were honest refugees, but many were troublemakers, including\nagents of Saruman. Early in 3019, there was fighting in Bree, and the\nShire was taken over by Saruman's agents.\n\nThe Hobbits expelled the Men from the Shire in the Battle of Bywater on\nNovember 3, and the Rangers of the North returned from the war and dealt\nwith the other troublemakers. The North-kingdom was reestablished by\nAragorn, King Elessar, and the North-South Road was open to travellers\nonce more.\n\n\nNames & Etymology\n\nThe NORTH-SOUTH ROAD was called the GREENWAY in later years by the\nBree-folk because it had become disused and overgrown with grass. It was\nsometimes called the NORTH ROAD and the OLD SOUTH ROAD.\n\nThe North-South Road and the Great West Road were collectively called\nthe ROYAL ROAD or the GREAT ROAD. (Note that the Great East Road was\nalso referred to as the Great Road.)"

This marked the start of the\nyears when the Children of Ilúvatar were active in Middle-earth. Later\nin the First Age the second kindred, humans, and Ilúvatar's adopted\nchildren, the Dwarves, also awoke.\n\nTolkien wrote that the later Ages lasted about 3,000 years, though this\nduration was not fixed and he felt that the Ages 'sped up' over time.\nEach ended following the completion of some major event in the history\nof the Children of Ilúvatar.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn some texts Tolkien referred to the 'First Age of Middle-earth' or the\n'First Age of the World' rather than the 'First Age of the Children of\nIlúvatar'. These variations had earlier starting points, extending the\nFirst Age back to the creation of Arda, but consistently ended with\nMorgoth's defeat in Beleriand.\n\nThe terms 'First Age of the Sun' and 'Ages of the Sun' are commonly used\nby many fans, but do not appear anywhere in Tolkien's writings. The\n'First Age of the Sun' in this conception is held to begin with the\nfirst rising of the Sun and continue until Morgoth's defeat nearly 600\nyears later. While this is at odds with Tolkien's statements that the\nFirst Age was the longest by far it is a common misapprehension because\nthe subsequent ages all took place entirely during the Years of the Sun.\n\nThe time of Arda is typically rendered in Ages. Ages are one epoch of\nthe Valar. Before the arising of the Sun they were approximately one\nthousand Valian Years in length (the exact length of a Valian Year\nvaried in different drafts of Tolkien's texts from close to 10\n“Sun”-years in most versions to precisely 144 “Sun”-years in his final\nestimation). After the Sun Ages “sped up”, and length is more variable.\nThe Years of the Sun began with the 30th Valian Age, and the Fourth Age\nof Middle-earth began with the 37th Valian Age. However, only four, not\nseven Ages are counted. The Second and later Ages, during the Years of\nthe Sun, correspond more to the earlier Valarian Eras than to their\nAges.\n\n\nBrief Timeline\n\n    _For a much more detailed description of Timeline see: Timeline of\n    Arda_\n\n-   Before the Ainur were made.

    "title": "Sentinels of the Woodland Realms",
    "page_id": "13461",
    "text": "The Silvan sentinels were the guardians of the woodland realms of the\nElves in Middle-earth.\n\n\nOrigin\n\nThe Silvan archers reached their peak after the fall of Morgoth, at the\nstart of the Second Age of the Sun. This was a period after Beleriand\nhad fallen into ruin and many Elven lords, both Ñoldor and Sindar, began\nto expand into the rest of Middle-earth, setting up fiefs and kingdoms\nin places such as Eregion, Lórien and Greenwood the Great. The latter\ntwo were at this time inhabited by those Avari, or “unwilling” Elves who\nwould not take the journey to Valinor. These were the great days, when\nthe Sindar lords came upon the Avari or Silvan Elves and were taken in\nas kings, great lords who knew and taught much knowledge and crafts to\nthe Silvan Elves. At that time the dark forest of Mirkwood was not in\nexistence, but was rather known as Greenwood the Great, a huge and lush\nforest inhabited by many fair creatures, whose beauty and richness was\nlike that of Doriath in Beleriand. So similar it was to Doriath like the\nSindar immediately settled there and were warmly welcomed by the Silvan\nElves. Through knowledge of the Sindar craft, the Silvan Elves were able\nto hone their skills with the bow and become master archers, now\noutfitted with new, shining weaponry and gear that only the Eldar could\nmake. But as for their own woodcraft, none could surpass the Silvan\nElves, who were already masters of the forest, able to hide in the\nshadows and remain undetected. Indeed, the “Silvan Shadow” was a trait\nnot even the Sindar could master. Thus the true Sentinel of the Forest\nwas born.\n\n\nGear\n\nThe weapons of the sentinel are few, easy to carry but extremely deadly.\nA standard warden would have a longbow, usually made of mallorn wood, an\nElven dagger, knife or handaxe and a quiver full of arrows, sometimes\ntipped with poison or barbed. A wealthier archer would probably have a\nshortsword as well, of Elven make of course. The armour of the Silvan\nsentinel is light as well, easily able to blend in with its\nsurroundings, whatever they may be. Indeed, the famous Lorien cloaks\nperform just this task. Apart from a cloak or mantle, the archer has a\nleather shirt, leggings, greaves, gauntlets, etc. He is very lightly\narmoured, for he is not expected to be heard by his enemy by the\njostling of mail or be forced into a prolonged fight. However a richer,\nmore elite archer may wear partial chainmail (always Elven made).\n\n\nEffectiveness ﻿\n\nA sentinel is quite deadly, provided he is well armed and he is covered\nby a woodland surrounding. His aim is not to hit and run, but rather to\nwipe out any foul and evil creature seen lurking in his zone of patrol,\nwithout being seen. During the War of the Ring, the sentinels were hard\nput to defending their borders, for the shadow of Dol Guldur had\nlaunched reparative raids on both woodland realms, ultimately\nculminating in the Battle Under the Trees, when the sentinel's finest\nhour had arrived. During the battle, the forces of Dol Guldur were\nbeaten back from Lórien and Thranduil's Halls and eventually the Hill of\nSorcery itself was laid bare by the White Lady of Lórien herself,\nGaladriel. This proves that the Silvan sentinel's effectiveness goes far\nand beyond that of any other woodsman in Middle-earth.\n\n\nDecline of the Sentinel\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, Mirkwood was made fair again but the time of\nthe Sindar had ended in Middle-earth. Thus, the Silvan Elves, who were\nof the Avari, remained in their dwindling kingdoms, but eventually their\npeople dwindled as well, so much so that they became only a memory, a\nlegend of elder days. The World has changed, Arda has been reshaped, but\nin the few forests that still exist on this earth, an ancient spirit or\ntwo of the Avari wardens may continue to dwell that has yet to see the\nfinal chapter of its history.\n\n\nSources\n\n-   The Fellowship of the Ring, Ch.

It had been known that a\nfleet of Haradrim Corsairs of Umbar was making its way up the Anduin to\nreinforce the Enemy who had overrun the Pelennor and besieged Minas\nTirith. Thus, Aragorn and company decided to intercept the fleet before\nthey reached Minas Tirith, and then hopefully use the enemy vessels to\nswiftly move up the Anduin and break the siege. As they made their way\nthrough Gondor's western provinces, they gradually gathered more and\nmore reinforcements.\n\nThe Battle\n\nOn March 13, 3019, Aragorn along with the Grey Company, and their new\nreinforcements which included mercenary archers from the Blackroot Vale\nnear Erech, infantry from Lebennin and Lamedon and many other cavalry\nand mercenary infantry finally intercepted the enemy fleet at Pelargir,\na famous port city on the lower Anduin known for its skilled mariners.\nThe corsairs had foolishly delayed their arrival at the Pelennor by\nstopping at port towns along their way to loot and pillage them. While\nthey were just about to do the same at Pelargir, Aragorn's forces showed\njust in time to give them battle in the streets and harbour of the city.\nThe moderately sized force of Aragorn was able to triumph over the much\ngreater corsair force by systematically defeating small units of men who\nwere spread throughout the city. The Army of the Dead's actual chief\nweapon was fear, which drove the corsairs manning the ships to flee\ntheir vessels and jump overboard, without giving battle. In just a short\ntime, Aragorn's forces had freed Pelargir from the corsair threat and\nhad wrested control of their vessels, opening the way to a speedy relief\nof the siege of Minas Tirith.\n\nAfter the Battle\n\nAragorn's army, now reinforced with mariners from Pelargir, could now\nsail up the Anduin unopposed, but first Aragorn had to disband the much\nhelpful Army of the Dead. Instead of taking them to fight at the\nPelennor Fields, Aragorn decided to hold their oath fulfilled and thus\nfreed them of their living dead, much to their King's satisfaction. With\nthe Corsairs force defeated, Aragorn's army quickly loaded the vessels\nat Pelargir and set off up the Anduin to relieve the siege of Minas\nTirith.",

Under Folcwine, one Éored was made up\nof 120 riders including their captain. Each Éored was also supposed to\ncomprise one one-hundredth of the whole Muster of Rohan, not including\nthe household of the King.\n\nAn Éored was a group of trained warriors who rode as a unit. Under the\nmilitary reorganization in the time of King Folcwine, the size of a full\nÉored was determined to be at least 120 men. One Éored was one hundredth\nof the Éoherë - the full muster of Rohan. The Riders of an Éored could\nserve for a term or on a permanent basis. A Captain led each Éored. In\ntimes of war or unrest, the Marshals of the Mark each had a battle-ready\nÉored as part of his household, which he could command at his\ndiscretion.\n\nThe changes made by Folcwine lasted through the time of the War of the\nRing. While the Éoherë commanded by Théoden King son of Thengel at the\nBattle of the Pelennor Fields did not number much more than half of the\n12,000 riders supossed to be a full muster of Rohan, it was possibly the\nlargest riding of the Rohirrim in history. Éowyn (disguised as a Rider\nnamed Dernhelm) and Merry Brandybuck rode with the Éored commanded by\nElfhelm to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields on March 15. When the\nRohirrim charged onto the battlefield, Éomer led the first Éored in the\ncenter while Elfhelm's Éored was on the right flank and Grimbold's was\non the left flank and the other companies followed behind.

It was moved several times\nduring the course of the series, from Smaug's hoard to Bilbo to the\nMathom-house to Frodo. It was taken by the Orcs of Cirith Ungol from\nFrodo, but was later with the Mouth of Sauron, as he showed it to\nGandalf, Aragorn, and the other leaders outside the Morannon in the\nBattle of the Black Gate. It was later returned to Frodo.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe origins of the shirt are largely unknown, though it was said to have\nbeen made for a young Elf prince long ago. It eventually came to be part\nof the Dwarven treasure hoard of the Lonely Mountain. It was found by\nthe dragon Smaug and added to his treasure heap. Here, it was given by\nThorin II Oakenshield to the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, who wore it during\nthe Battle of Five Armies. After returning to the Shire, Bilbo loaned\nthe shirt to the Mathom-house. Before departing the Shire for Rivendell,\nBilbo reclaimed the shirt and wore it on that journey.\n\nMany years later it was given by Bilbo to his nephew Frodo Baggins as\nFrodo set out on his quest to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Frodo\nwore the chain shirt under his tunic unknown to the rest of the\nFellowship. It was discovered when, during a skirmish in the mines of\nMoria, an Orc chieftain stabbed Frodo with a spear. The shirt\nprevented what would have been a lethal wound, leaving Frodo badly\nbruised but otherwise uninjured.\n\nThe shirt was confiscated from Frodo in the Tower of Cirith Ungol. The\ntwo squadrons of orcs that captured Frodo fought over the valuable\nshirt, and most were killed during the conflict. One of the two Orc\nleaders, Shagrat, survived the fight and seized the shirt, escaping the\ntower with it. The shirt eventually ended up in the possession of the\nMouth of Sauron at Barad-dûr, where he presented it to Gandalf at the\nBlack Gates as false evidence that Frodo had failed in his quest. In his\nwrath Gandalf retrieved the shirt. The wizard later returned it to Frodo\nafter the destruction of the Ring.\n\nit:Cotta di Mithril"

They were made around the same\ntime as the Rings of Power and there were, presumably, many of them\nsince “In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made” and there are\nonly twenty Rings of Power, unless twenty is considered “many” rings.\nGandalf states that though the Elves who forged them thought little of\nthem, he still thinks they are dangerous for mortals.\n\nThey are lesser rings of the Rings of Power, forged by the Elves as\n“essays in the craft”- they bore no gem (similar to the One Ring).\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the ancient days of the Second Age, before the Fall of Númenor, many\nrings were forged, the craft being taught by Sauron. These rings aided\nin the use of spells and magical craft, and thus were widely popular\nwith the Elves. Sauron, then known as “Lord of the Gifts” claimed he\nwished to make Middle-earth as fair as Valinor, and it seemed he\nconvinced the elves to think these rings could do so.\n\nAfter the forging of the One Ring, Sauron began drawing these lesser\nrings to himself. This was not difficult, for the One Ring gave him the\nstrength to subdue the wielders of these powerful artifacts. Once\ngathered, Sauron could disperse them among his captains, making them all\nmighty champions whom he could back up at will with his own strength via\nthe magic ring connection. After the Last Alliance of Elves and Men and\nthe First Fall of Sauron, these rings were dispersed through the land.\nSome were taken from dead warriors, others, borne away by the\nfrightened, still living servants of Sauron, others were lost and little\nis known of what happened to them until the War of the Ring.\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring, Sauron gathered again the lesser\nrings to himself. But this time, he kept a great deal of them so as to\nadvance his own abilities. Though not stated in the books or movies, it\nseems reasonable to believe that some were given again to his commanders\nas well, and logically some were lost or destroyed before they could be\nreclaimed. \n\nTheir ultimate fates are unknown, nor is it known whether or not their\npowers were bound to the power of the One Ring. If they were, then their\npower would have failed with the destruction of the One.\n\n\nPowers\n\nThe full extent of the rings' power is unknown, but Gandalf says that\n“none are to be used lightly”. They were, to an extent, like the One\nRing when it came to temptation. They would give a being strength,\nmagical ability, and the power to dominate other wills.\n\nIt is also believed (though again, not stated) that these rings also had\ncertain fields in which they were strongest. For example, one ring may\nrule over stone, while another controls ice. This, however, is not known\nfact, and only stems from what is known about the Rings of Power,\nassuming that the lesser rings are much like them."

Until the main part\nof the battle started, the host guarded the Pass of Sirion before\nmarching forth at the start of the battle and for the most part, the\nking was able to restrain most of his people from the rash onslaught\nstarted by Gwindor. Then the host of Turgon threw itself into the battle\njoining the ranks of the western host coming to the aid of Fingon, and\ntogether they battled the enemy on the wastes of Anfauglith.\n\nHowever, the enemy proved too powerful and the host was cast aside and\nthe battle lost. The host survived with help of the Men of the House of\nHador led by Húrin and Huor, and they were able to kept the enemy from\nbreaking through the Pass Sirion. Then Turgon, listening to the council\nof Húrin and Huor was persuaded to return to Gondolin. Battling its way\nsouth and covered by the valiant rearguard of the Hador, the host\nescaped back to Gondolin through the Encircling Mountains at the expense\nof the Hador who all perished in the Fen of Serech save for Húrin.\n"

Tu is described as a “wizard” or “fay” who ruled\nthe Dark-Elves of the further east of Middle-earth around Cuievenan just\nbefore the making of the Sun. One of his subjects, Nuin Father of\nSpeech, came to a hidden valley of great loveliness and found there\nsleeping figures young but not children, boys and girls: the Fathers of\nMen. He told this to Tu, who fell into great fear of the One, and told\nNuin that these were the Fathers of Men, who were to be undisturbed.\nNotes then tell that Nuin awoke two of the Sleepers, Ermon and Elmir,\nand taught them speech; that Tu and Nuin shepherded the Sleepers when\nthey awoke with the Sun, and that Men split into factions in the years\nafterward. Tu grew to shun day and took to dwelling underground. A demon\nnamed Fankil, son of Melkor, arose and set Men at each other's throats,\nand especially against the Elves. The folk of Ermon stood with the\nElves, but Tu came forth and destroyed Fankil, and was buried under\nfalling hills.\n\nWhat manner of being Tu was, shall doubtless never be known, other than\nthat he was no Elf, nor Wizard, nor any of the incarnate Maiar, but a\nnew thing entirely, even as Bombadil and Goldberry doubtless are. He was\ndescribed a great magician and a being of power, benevolent but testy,\nand afterwards came to have great hatred of Men for the deeds they did\nto his Elves.\n\nHis role later became _Thu_, who was later SAURON."

Their armor was similar to the rest of Saruman's Uruk-hai\nconsisting of a steel segmented breastplate, greaves, a helmet and\ngauntlets which often varied in appearance and quality due to being\nproduced by crude orc smiths.

When his\nthoughts turned to Rohan, it became apparent that however heavy the\ninfantry were, there was no standing against the legendary cavalry of\nthe Rohirrim.

It\nresulted in Frodo getting stabbed by a Morgul-blade and only minor\ninjuries to the Nazgûl.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nAfter Bilbo Baggins' 111th birthday party, the One Ring was passed onto\nhis nephew, Frodo Baggins. After Gandalf returned from Gollum's\ninterrogation, he ordered Frodo and Samwise Gamgee to flee from The\nShire and meet him at The Prancing Pony in Bree. Upon leaving, Frodo and\nSam met with Merry and Pippin, who decided to join them in their quest\nto Bree.\n\nStrider and Making Way to Weathertop\n\nThe Hobbits reached The Prancing Pony and Gandalf was nowhere to be\nseen. After Frodo accidentally placed on the One Ring, Aragorn,\ndisguised as a man named Strider, pulled Frodo to another section of The\nPrancing Pony to tell him that their journey is not over and they must\njourney to Rivendell where the ring will be in safer hands.\n\nThe group stopped at Weathertop as night was coming. As Aragorn left to\ngather more supplies and look out for intruders, the Nazgûl found the\nHobbits and chased them to the top of Weathertop where the battle was to\nbegin.\n\n\nThe Battle\n\n\n\nThe Hobbits attacked the Nazgûl as the battle began. Due to their\ninexperience with Swords and combat, the Hobbits were no match against\nthe Nazgûl and were defeated with minor wounds. The Witch-king of Angmar\nthen realized that Frodo had the One Ring and approached him during the\nbattle.\n\nAragorn arrived before more damage could be done onto the Hobbits. He\nfought against the Nazgûl and was able to drive most of them away.\nHowever, noticing the Witch-King approaching, Frodo put on the One Ring\nin attempt to hide from the Witch-King. That proved to have no effect\nwhen the Witch-king saw him in the wraith-world, and stabbed his\nshoulder with a Morgul-blade.\n\nFrodo fainted, but took off the Ring before losing consciousness\ncompletely. Aragorn was able to drive the rest of the Nazgûl off, but\nFrodo had sustained a wound that would haunt him in the years after.\n\nThe Nazgûl escaped but Frodo was left poisoned by the Witch-king's\ndagger and required healing from the Elves."

    "text": "History\n\nBackground\n\nIn the ages prior to the sun, Arda was reformed by the massive energy\nreleased when Melkor destroyed the original light sources, the two\nLamps. The Valar fled the razing to the newly formed continent of Aman\nand built Valinor, while Melkor reigned unchecked in the new continent\nof Middle-earth, where he corrupted the surviving beasts. Unaware of\nthese designs, the Valar did not approach him for fear that the\nconfrontation would be just as world-devastating as the extinguishment\nof the light. Their priority was to protect the original plan of\ncreation, though they were unsure of what was salvageable. They did not\nknow if Eru's personal creations, elves and men, would now ever come\ninto being after the catastrophe.\n\nFortunately, the elves did come to being; however, they appeared in\nMiddle-earth near Cuiviénen. Withdrawn, the Valar were unaware of this.\nOn the other hand, Melkor was quickly learned of this through his spies.\nSoon, elves who wandered too far from their lands were captured and\ntaken to the fortresses of Angband and Utumno. There, in Melkor's utmost\ncontempt for Eru and his sole ability to create life, they were\ncorrupted through torture into servants bred solely for war - orcs.\n\nSometime later, while on a hunting trip in Middle-earth, the Valar Oromë\nstumbled upon the elves that were unharmed. After realizing what they\nwere, he asked them to return with him to Valinor for their protection.\nWhile the majority of them agreed, a some refused, believing him to be\ntheir kidnapper. When Oromë returned with the elves willing to leave\nwith him, the Valar were made aware of orcs. Their creation was\nmost-likely seen as the worst imaginable offense. Manwë and the rest of\nthe Valar could stand this no longer, and so the Valar took counsel with\neach other and decided to rid Middle-earth of Melkor's tyranny.\n\nThe War\n\nSoon, the Valar declared war on Melkor, presumably a massive army of\nlight and battled him for many decades. The Host of the Valar easily\ndefeated Melkor's host at the Battle of the Powers in northwestern\nMiddle-earth. The remnant of his forces fled back to Utumno and\nfortified themselves there. The Valar passed over Middle-earth and\nplaced a guard over Cuiviénen to protect the elves from any further\neffects of the war or perhaps from an attack from Melkor's servants.\nThen, the Host of the Valar went north to Utumno and besieged it. After\ndecades of siege, the Host of the Valar finally broke through and after\nTulkas himself personally defeated Melkor in combat, they captured him\nand took him to Valinor for judgment, and sentenced him to prison in the\nHalls of Mandos for thousands of years.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe war between the two powers devastated the lands of Middle-earth and\nthe face of the continent was changed. The distance between Middle-earth\nand Aman separated by the Great Sea became wider. A Gulf in south was\ncreated and small bays appeared between the Great Gulf and Helcaraxë.\nThe Mountains of Hithlum and the highlands of the Dorthonion were\ncreated. The Sirion river that flowed into the newly formed Bay of Balar\nappeared. Free of evil, the elves were invited to Valinor and undertook\na Great Journey across Middle-earth in which new Elven cultures were\ndeveloped. The result was the peopling and colonisation of the western\nparts of Middle-earth with the Children of Ilúvatar.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe main legacy of war was that it allowed the Elves to go to Aman and\nValinor where they became High Elves, enlightened, cultured, and\nskilled. Elves in Middle-earth established themselves learning much of\nnature, woodlore, and shipbuilding. However, the fear brought about by\nMelkor caused some elves to relent and stay in the east longer. These\nelves, the Avari and the rest of the Dark Elves developed separate and\nmore secretive cultures and stayed away from the affairs of their long\nloss brethren for the most part. They would then thousands and thousands\nof years later in the Third and Fourth Ages become the Wood-elves that\nwould be the last of the kindreds of left in Middle-earth ever after.\nThe languages of the elves spread throughout Middle-earth and blended\nand influenced other tongues and became known of ever after.\n\nThe other legacy was that Melkor, then released from prison who would\never after remember that his downfall was because of the Elves sought\nrevenge thus causing the Revolt of the Ñoldor and the War of the Jewels\nand the battles and dramas that followed. It would also serve to\nshape the course of the history of the Children of Ilúvatar for ages to\ncome."

Tolkien participated in the battle and witnessed\nfirsthand the carnage, suffering, and terrible losses of life. The\nresult was that it was to have a profound effect on Tolkien's works,\nmost notably _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\nTolkien's good friends Robert Gilson and Geoffrey Bache Smith were\nkilled in the battle.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe battle started on the 1 July 1916 after a heavy artillery\nbombardment on the German lines that had begun a week before on 24 June\n1916. The battle was intended to be a decisive breakthrough for the\nallies against the Central Powers, but it did not turn out that way. The\nbattle ended on the 18 November 1916. In the space of just over four\nmonths, the battle produced over one million casualties and was\nindecisive and although the allies gained ground (only five miles total)\nthey did not break through the German lines and win the war.\n\nThe battle was fought on the Western Front in the north-central Somme\nand southeastern Pas-de-Calais Départements, of France.\n\nTolkien's role\n\nTolkien's involvement in the battle lasted from July to October 1916\nduring which he served as a Battalion Signalling Officer to the 11th\nBattalion of The Lancashire Fusiliers. His unit operated mainly in the\nnorthern section of the Somme and was stationed in the Beaumont-Hamel,\nSerre, and Leipzig salient trenches. He was in the Battle of Thiepval\nRidge and helped captured the Regina Trench from the Germans for a time.\nThe filthy and wretched conditions of the trenches and areas of battle\nalong with stress caused Tolkien to come down with Trench fever and\nTrench foot, which put him out of the war permanently.\n\n\nAftermath and Effects on Writing\n\nWhile in hospital recovering from his diseases of war, Tolkien did much\nwriting where his experiences in the battle were where many of the ideas\nfor the terrible battles of the War of the Ring and the epic Fall of\nGondolin, which were outlined in _The Lord of the Rings_ and the _Book\nof Lost Tales_. Another theme which grew out of Tolkien's participation\nin the battle was the struggles of ordinary peoples in extraordinary\nsituations and that the smallest of people can make big contributions\nand differences. Possibly, Tolkien was inspired by the great potential,\nbravery, and hardiness he saw in the ordinary low-ranked citizen\nsoldiers that fought in the battle."

However, the tide turned in favor\nof the goblins when the Balrog known as Durin's Bane emerged and led a\nmassive army of goblins in a counter-attack. No dwarf of the colony\nsurvived.\n\n\nHistory\n\n48 years after the Battle of the Five Armies, Balin along with Flói,\nÓin, Ori, Frár, Lóni, Náli, and a large colony of Dwarves marched from\nthe Lonely Mountain to Moria to reclaim the dwarven city with the\nunwilling leave of Dain II Ironfoot as he feared what was there. He\nhoped to reclaim some of the lost treasures of the lost realm like the\nRing of Thrór. The initial battles took place from the Dimrill Dale to\nthe Chamber of Mazarbul in which Flói was killed before they reached the\nFirst Hall. Nevertheless everything went well as the Dwarves proved to\nbe fiercely determined to take back their home, slaying every goblin in\ntheir path, eventually some of Moria was reclaimed and they dwelt in the\nTwenty-first Hall until Balin moved to the Chamber of Mazarbul which\nthen become his seat of government from then on. For the next few years,\nBalin ruled as Lord of Moria. The goblins became a mere nuisance during\nthose years and were not serious threats. Here, Balin and company found\nDurin's Axe and some sort of 'helm'.\n\nLittle did the Dwarves know, that Moria was ruled by a Balrog, a demon\nof the Eldar Days that survived in the deeps for many thousands of years\nthat the Dwarves were no match for. By the year TA 2994, Durin's Bane\nand a horde of goblins launched a massive counterattack from the east.\nBalin was shot by an archer and died in Dimrill Dale and many other\nDwarves perished as well and retreated into the mines. Bloody fighting\ntook place all over Moria, but the strength of the Dwarves were\nultimately no match for the sheer number of goblins and the power of the\nBalrog. Soon the Bridge of Khazad-dum and the Second Hall were taken by\nthe goblins. Frár and Lóni and Náli were among the casualties the\nDwarves lost in the second hall. Oin and a group of Dwarves tried to\nescape through the Doors of Durin but were killed by the Watcher in the\nWater. The last Dwarves barred the doors of the Chamber of Mazarbul and\nwere able to built a tomb for Balin. Eventually, the goblins broke\nthrough and slew the remaining Dwarves ending the peaceful\nre-colonization of Moria.\n\n\nAftermath\n\nWith the Dwarven colony destroyed, Moria continued to be a place of evil\nthat none dared enter until the Fellowship of the Ring learned of it\nwhen they passed through it, slaying Durin's Bane in the process.\n"

    "page_id": "22367",
    "text": "There is significant debate over the ORIGINS OF DRAGONS in\nMiddle-earth.\n\n\nExtreme Intelligence\n\n[Tolkien's portraits about his ideas of dragons in Middle-Earth.\nDragons were known to be very intelligent. This has led many to think\nthat the theory which suggests that dragons are merely corrupted beasts\nis false. For example David Day writes,  “The intelligence of Dragons\nwas renowned, as was their love of setting and solving riddles. Dragons\n. . . were creatures of immense cleverness and knowledge but not of\nwisdom, for their intelligence had the flaws of vanity, gluttony, greed,\ndeceit and wrath.”\n\n\nDifferent Theories\n\n-   The theory that Dragons were simply beasts physically enhanced by\n    Morgoth, such as corrupted eagles, is a very popular theory, but\n    there are issues with this line of thought. Randall Johnson\n    writes: “Dragons understand many tongues, and they are known for\n    speaking in riddles. Dragons are very intelligent, able to lead\n    armies into battle. Dragons are able to petrify and hypnotize with\n    but a glance of their eyes.  Dragons cast spells and curses. Some\n    Dragons breathe fire. These properties and powers are not\n    characteristic of simple beasts”. Another problem is, of course that\n    dragons did not originally have wings.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The theory that dragons are sparks of the spirit of Melkor has\n    merit. According to this theory, Melkor bred monstrous reptiles and\n    poured a portion of his own spirit into them, giving them\n    semi-independent wills and consciousnesses.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   One theory claims that dragons find their origins in Yavanna's\n    creation; they were born to be part of Arda's ecosystems just as\n    other animals, or were specifically created to serve as guardians\n    who would protect the harmony and peace of nature like the Eagles.\n    These beasts were then later (or even before the spread of their\n    races across Arda) altered and corrupted by the Dark Lord and\n    adopted into his forces. Gigantic reptilian races such as dinosaurs,\n    Megalanias, Titanoboas, and the Fell Beasts might or might not have\n    shared their origins with dragons according to this theory. This\n    fits with the origin of Orcs, which are descended from corrupted\n    Elves as well as the assertion that only Eru is capable of creating\n    life.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The next theory is that dragons are simply embodied Maiar much like\n    the Balrogs. This theory avoids many of the problems of the previous\n    ideas on draconic origins. According to this theory, dragons are\n    Maiar, ancient spirits in the form of gigantic, serpentine\n    monsters. The fact that Maiar have the ability to take on corporeal\n    forms has been established previously. Melkor's deadly allies, the\n    Balrogs, were Maiar in the raiment of fire and shroud. The Wizards\n    were Maiar in the form of Men or Elves.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The final theory is that dragons are actually descendants of\n    embodied Maiar and beasts (more likely monsters or Nameless Things)\n    much like Ungoliant procreates with spiders. This theory is\n    generally considered to have great strength by Middle-earth\n    experts. Johnson writes: “ theory contends that at some\n    point in time, a Maia, according to the bidding of Melkor, assumed a\n    bodily form genetically compatible with an existing reptile. Recall\n    that Sauron himself took the form of a serpent. 'Then Sauron shifted\n    shape, from wolf to serpent, and from monster to his own accustomed\n    form.' (Silmarillion, 212) This serpent-Maia mated with the reptile,\n    procreating the first Dragon, Glaurung. Glaurung then mated either\n    with other existing reptiles or with other serpent-Maiar in order to\n    reproduce.  Eventually, the Dragons became a self-sustainable race.”"

    "text": "The FIRST SACK OF DORIATH, or the SACK OF MENEGROTH, was an attack on\nDoriath by the Dwarves of Nogrod in the late First Age.\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe cause of the attack was the Dwarves' desire to possess the Silmaril,\nset in the dwarven-made jewel, the Nauglamir, for themselves. After the\ntwo treasures were brought together, Thingol sought to take it and set\nabout it his neck but the Dwarves withheld it from him, saying that he\nhadn't the right to do so as it was a dwarven heirloom taken from\nNargothrond by theft. Then in a gesture of great pride, Thingol scorned\nthe dwarves as inferiors undeserving in comparison to himself and\nproceeded to speak ill of them, deeming they should be gone out of his\nrealm forever. Insulted and ever wanting the Silmaril, the Dwarves'\nhearts kindled to rage and they fell upon him and there was a great\nbattle within the palace, Thingol was seemingly defeated, and took the\nNauglamir and the Silmaril, but were driven out of the fortress.\n\nThe Dwarves left Menegroth, but it didn't take long for the alarm to be\nraised on what had been done, and soon all of Doriath was roused. With\ngreat wrath, the dwarves were pursued to the death and all but two\nreturned home to Nogrod. When they arrived, the survivors lied about\nwhat really happened, saying that their brothers had been slain at the\ncommand of the Thingol, hoping to cheat them of their reward. The\nDwarves of Nogrod then became filled will wrath and desired revenge.\nThey tried to get the Dwarves of Belegost to help them but they refused.\n\nLater the Dwarves were allowed past the Girldle with the help of\ntreacherous elves who were under the curse of the treasure. Meanwhile\nThingol was lured out of the fortress on a hunt with only a small\ncompany of arms. The dwarves were waiting for him an ambush finally slew\nthe king, and the fortress of the THousand Caves was taken unawares and\nplundered, bringing well nigh to ruin the glory of Doriath.\n\nMelian, full of grief and pain at the loss of her husband and seeing\nthat that the doom she had so feared had finally come upon Doriath,\nwithdrew her protection of the realm. The dwarves could neither harm nor\nseize her and she went forth...\n\nHere there is a split in the accounts...\n\nIn Beren and Luthien (2017) to sought after Beren and Luthien, to warn\nhem of the Dwarves approach. Giving them a chance with help of the\nGreen Elves to stop the Dwarves at the battle of the Stony Ford. Melien\nalso tells Beren the dangers of the Mim's cursed treasure, and has\ndiscussions with her daughter Luthien. She gives the Silmaril to Beren\nfor safe keeping. In time Luthien faded, and Beren died, and their son\nDior became heir to Doriath (taking the Silmaril with him) and helped\nraise its glory anew, though Melian dwelt in that place, and she\nreturned back to and of the Gods.\n\nAlternatively another somewhat later account (closer to how it appears\nin The Silmarillion (1977)) Dior leaves later while his family was still\nalive and become the new king of Doriath. It was when Green Elves\nbrought him a coffer with the Necklace of the Dwarves, that he knew his\nparents had died. He stared at the Silmaril long with grief that death\nhad come upon his parents so soon.\n\nIn the Silmarillion (1977), the co-author Guy Kay was tasked with coming\nup with an explanation for why the girdle/veil of Melian was brought\ndown to allow dwarves back into the city to sack it. It is not clear how\nmuch of it was J.R. Tolkiens ideas and how much of it was Guy Kay's but\nUnfinished Tales and HoMe series attribute much of that chapter as a\nconstruction of Kays.\n\nIn the story as it appears in Of the Sacking of Doriath, she entrusted\nMablung to send word to Beren at Tol Galen and gave him the Silmaril for\nsafe-keeping. She then left Middle-earth and returned to Valinor leaving\nDoriath vulnerable.\n\nAs per HoMe Christopher Tolkien mentions never being fully happy with\nhaving used a construction (that was not wholly of his fathers) and in\nhindsight and with discovery of later works of his father (which\nincluded the intent to go back and incorporate much of the elements of\nthe earlier stories), he admits he could have retained much the elements\nof both accounts, with very little editorial involvement (and should\nhave included the extended parts of the story). In the 2017 Beren and\nLuthien work, he has reached that goat to a certain degree.\n\n\n\n\nThe Attack\n\nThe Dwarves of Nogrod assembled a great host and marched out of the Blue\nMountains, crossing the river Gelion, and headed westward to Doriath.\nCrossing the Aros River, the Dwarves reached Doriath with no magical\nenchantments (i.e. the Girdle of Melian) or barriers to stop them. The\nElven sentinels and their captains there were no match for them, and\nwere quickly defeated; then with few losses the Dwarves passed over the\ngreat Bridge of Menegroth, and entered the caves thus beginning the\nBattle of the Thousand Caves. After fierce fighting in which many on\nboth sides were killed, they were victorious and pillaged, plundered,\nand destroyed at their leisure and much was taken from the Great Hall of\nThingol. Then, they came to the the treasury and slew Mablung before its\ndoors and took the Nauglamir and the Silmaril.\n\n\nAfterwards\n\nThe Dwarves left Doriath but didn't live to enjoy the fruits of their\nvictory. At Sarn Athrad, they were ambushed by an army of Laiquendi led\nby Beren with his son Dior. The Dwarven host, heavily weighed-down with\nloot, were destroyed and the survivors that fled into the forest ran\ninto the Ents and were killed. The Silmaril and Nauglamir were taken by\nBeren to Tol Galen. This marked the end of the first kingdom of Doriath\nuntil Dior and his wife Nimloth came to refounded it later ruling over\nthe surviving Sindar, soon afterwards.\n"

    "text": "ORKISH was the general term for the jumble of languages used by the\nOrcs, composed of corrupted borrowings from other languages of\nMiddle-earth, including Sauron's Black Speech and later Westron.\n\nWhen they were originally bred in the First Age, the Orcs had little\nmore language than beasts, but borrowed what they could from other\nlanguages and corrupted it to their liking. In the Second Age, Sauron\ncorrupted and combined Valarin and Quenya to create Black Speech, which\nhe intended to make the official language of all who served him. He\nultimately failed in this purpose, although several generations of Orcs\nwere probably bred in Mordor and raised on this language before the War\nof the Last Alliance.\n\nAfter Sauron's defeat at the end of the Second Age the Orcs were\ndivided. Eventually they had almost as many dialects as they had groups\nand settlements, and “Orkish” quickly became useless to them for\ninter-breed communication. So most Orcs learned to speak a debased form\nof Westron for this purpose. By the late Third Age the Goblin tribes of\nthe Misty Mountains adopted this primitive dialect as their official\nlanguage, and Saruman later had it taught to the Half-orcs and Uruk-hai\nof Isengard. The Black Uruks and Uruk-hai of Mordor also spoke Westron,\nbut their first language was a debased form of Black Speech combined\nwith Orkish. There was also a new breed of small tracker Orcs known as\n“Snufflers” originally bred in Mordor. These particular Orcs spoke\nWestron in the company of Uruk-hai and Black Uruks, which meant that\nthey did not share the same language, and instead had their own language\nor knew only Westron."

Bilbo Baggins encountered one that\nbelonged to the Stone-troll, William, in _The Hobbit_. \n\n\nHistory\n\nWhen Bilbo was sent by Thorin to steal something from the Troll Camp;\nBilbo snuck up behind William and took his purse, but the purse yelled\nand alerted William, getting Bilbo caught. It is unknown what happened\nto the purse after its owner was turned to stone.\n\n\nOrigin\n\nIt is unknown what these creatures are or where they came from. They\ncouldn't have been made by Trolls (Trolls can't make much of anything)\nas even Morgoth can only alter (not truly create) life. They could have\nbeen bred by Sauron for the purpose of making sure that important goods\ncarried by trolls could not be stolen. However (since it would be\nstrange to create such a being just for trolls); it is likely that they\ngo all the way back to the First Age, bred by Morgoth to resemble\npurses. In this case, they were probably used by spies and thieves.  \n\nIf one of the pre-mentioned possibilities is correct, then trolls\nprobably took these \"purses' for themselves after the fall of Sauron at\nthe end of the Second Age. Either trolls figured out how to breed them;\nor the purses live forever and were antiques among trolls (unlikely).\nApart from the pre-mentioned, the only other possibilities are; they are\ncreatures that have an uncanny resemblance to purses, or they were\nanimals of some sort decorated to look like purses. It is unknown\nwhether trolls actually keep their valuables in the troll purses; or if\nthey keep their valuables else-where and the troll purse is just a lure.\nIf the latter is the case; then the fourth and fifth possibilities are\nmore likely than the first three (and vice versa).\n\nGiven that when Bilbo took the troll purse from WIlliam's pocket it\nyelled; “'Ere, 'oo are you?”, we can either assume that troll purses are\nsentient, or are trained to respond in certain ways."

The Citadel\nwould have been around 500 feet across.\n\n\nLayout\n\nThe Citadel is set out this way: In the centre is the White Tower,\nrising to a great height. Behind is the large sprawling King's House,\nwhere the Kings of Gondor once lived. In front of the tower is the Place\nof the Fountain, a courtyard containing the White tree and a central\nfountain. Around the Tower are ringed several other important buildings,\nincluding Merethrond, the Feasting Hall. The Citadel is accessed via a\nwide tunnel through the hill that leads to a small gate. The wide cliff\nnarrows to its point around 200 feet beyond the Citadel. As with all the\ncity's levels, the Citadel has a high wall and seven towers.\n\n\nThe Place of the Fountain\n\nProbably the most important symbolic area of the city, the Place of the Fountain was the\nhome of the great White Tree. It was a large circular grass area, around\n50 feet wide, with the White Tree being the central feature. The\nfountain was positioned some way before the tree. It flowed into a small\npool, then back round to the fountain. The Tree symbolised Gondor, and\nwas the flag and emblem of the City Guards. The Tree was grown from a\nseed of Nimloth, the tree given to the Númenóreans by the Eldar. It was\nplanted by Isildur, and grew to symbolise the blessings of Men. But in\nthe third age the tree was withered, perhaps symbolising Minas Tirith's\ndecline. It was only with the crowning of Aragorn Elessar that a new\nsapling was founded, showing the City's rise to glory under the new\nKing.\n\n\nThe Tower and other buildings\n\nThe Tower of Ecthelion is a tall white stone structure, rising 300 feet\nabove the citadel. The elevation of the city means it's topmost floor is\n1000 feet above the Pelennor Fields. It's name implies that it was\nprobably built by Denethor's father, Ecthelion, but it was possibly much\nolder. The Tower was used as a main business building, and contained\nseveral large council halls, and the imposing Throne Room. At the summit was the small\nchamber where Denethor kept Minas Tirith's Palantir.

It was guarded by the tower of Barad Eithel.\n\n\nCourse\n\nSirion flowed southwards along the border of the Ered Wethrin, passing\nthrough the Fen of Serech before entering the narrow steep-sided valley\nbetween the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath named the Pass of Sirion.\nSirion then continued south into Beleriand, with the Forest of Brethil\nto the west, and Dimbar and then Doriath to the east. After leaving\nDoriath at Aelin-uial (the Fens of Sirion) it plunged below ground in\nthe Falls of Sirion at Andram (the Long Wall), where the ground fell\nsteeply. Three leagues southwards the Sirion exited the underground\ncaves at the Gates of Sirion. It then flowed southwards through\nNan-Tathren until it reached the Bay of Balar, part of Belegaer, at the\nMouths of Sirion.\n\n\nTributaries\n\nIn order from north to south, the principal tributaries of the Sirion\nwere the Rivil, flowing from Dorthonion until it met Sirion in the Fen\nof Serech; the Mindeb, which had its source in Nan Dungortheb and the\nEred Gorgoroth, the Teiglin, the Esgalduin of Doriath; theAros flowing\nsouth from Dorthonion and west along the Forest of Region (and also\ncontaining the waters of the Celon from the Hills of Himring and Himlad)\nwhich met at Aelin-uial, and the Narog, which joined Sirion in\nNan-Tathren.\n\n\nCrossing Points\n\nThe main crossing point was the Ford of Brithiach where the road from\nHimlad which crossed the Esgalduin at Iant Iaur crossed Sirion. King\nThingol of Doriath also kept secret ferries in Doriath to cross the\nriver.\n\n\nSettlements\n\nBarad Eithel, at the source of the Sirion in the Ered Wethrin, was a\nchief fortress of Fingolfin and his son Fingon, which guarded the pass\ninto their realm of Mithrim. Further south, in the Pass of Sirion, lay\nTol Sirion (see below). After the Coming of Men, the Edainof the House\nof Haleth made their home in the Forest of Brethil, and the Sindar ruled\nby Thingol lay secure within the Girdle of Melian in their realm of\nDoriath. At the outflow of Sirion into Belegaer, after the\ndestruction of Eglarest and Brithombar, the Havens of Sirion were built\nby Círdan and his people.\n\n\nIslands\n\nThe most important island in Sirion was Tol Sirion. The original Minas\nTirith was built here by Finrod Felagund in the strategic location\ncontrolling the Pass of Sirion where it entered Beleriand between the\nEred Wethrin and the Echoriath. Shortly after Dagor Bragollach it was\ncaptured by Sauron and the island became known as Tol-in-Gaurhoth.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nSirion is a Sindarin/Noldorin name which contains the element sîr.\nDepending on the meaning of the second element, the name could either\nmean “great river” or “land of waters” (-ion as augmentative suffix or\narchaic plural genitive suffix).\n\nIts name in Khuzdul was Gabilān, with the element Gabil - “Great”."

Famous practitioners of dark sorcery are mostly dark\nservants of the infamous Dark Lords Melkor and Sauron. Its users, as\nwell as all human practitioners of magic, were called Sorcerers. The\nIstari used light magic, similar to the Elves and the Ainur in Valinor\nand outside of Arda, rather than dark sorcery.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nBefore his defeat, the Dark Lord Morgoth (Melkor) had used dark sorcery\nin his fortress of Utumno and later Angband. He was most infamous for\nhis experiments in creating and mutilating monsters, including the orcs,\nWargs and Dragons and used much of his powers to corrupt Arda.\n\nDark sorcery was also used in the Second and the Third Age by the Black\nNúmenóreans, a group of corrupted Númenóreans who grew during the later\nperiod of Númenor (especially after the arrival of Sauron) and who\nsurvived in the Númenórean colonies south of Gondor. Originally the\nstyled themselves as “King's Men” and persecuted The “Elf-friends”\nbecause of their loyalty to the Valar (The King's Men had grown jealous\nof the elves' immortality). After Sauron's arrival at Númenor they begun\nworshipping Melkor and the darkness they so feared, bringing human\nsacrifices to him. After the fall of Númenor the Black Númenóreans\ncontinued to serve Sauron. Two Black Númenóreans who were infamous for\nusing sorcery within Sauron's armies were the Witch-king of Angmar and\nthe Mouth of Sauron.\n\nAt around the late Third Age, in the fortress of Dol Guldur, the\nNecromancer (Sauron in disguise) was believed to be an Úlairi. He was\neventually forced out by the White Council, but he returned to his\nformer kingdom of Mordor and publicly declared himself alive, shown as\nMount Doom erupted once again.\n\nAfter Sauron's final destruction that began the Fourth Age, a Man by the\nname of Herumor had rose to power and was rumored to have established a\ncult that worshipped the Dark Powers in Gondor.\n\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nDark sorcery included a variety of spells, potions (alchemy) and other\nghastly things that belonged to the Dark Arts. Dark sorcery was\nfrequently used as a weapon, shown by the Witch-king's bewitched sword\nat the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.\n\nMorgul-blades were noted to have been enchanted with dark sorcery, so\nthat a victim would go through the Shadow World and turn into a wraith\nif stabbed.\n\nThe Fires of Orthanc were said to be sorcery invented or created by\nSaruman.\n\nMany of the Rings of Power (the only known exception being the three\nElf-rings) amplified the wearers abilities as a sorcerer and warrior and\nwhere presumably forged with the help of Dark Magic. The fortresses of\nDol Guldur and Minas Morgul were enchanted with sorcery, hence their\ntranslated names in Sindarin. \n\n\nKnown Practitioners\n\nPractitioners of dark sorcery were named 'Sorcerers' and these included:\n\n-   All the Dark Powers\n    -   Melkor\n    -   Sauron\n        -   Dark Servants of Sauron\n            -   Mouth of Sauron\n            -   Herumor\n            -   Saruman\n            -   Nazgûl\n                -   Witch-king of Angmar"

It was possibly due to the ancient hatred of the Men of the West\ngoing all the way back to the Edain, or toward the Númenóreans and the\nDúnedain in general for many defeats they handed them over the\ncenturies, most recently in the Last Alliance. The most likely\nanswer was probably revenge or more likely greed and a desire to covet\nthe lands of the Dúnedain. Gondor was in the midst of peace so they had\nthe element of surprise.\n\nEarly stages\n\nThe war began in TA 490 when the Easterlings suddenly invaded Gondor.\nNot fully prepared for war, the Easterlings were successful and no doubt\nravaged, pillaged, plundered, and caused much death in north-eastern\nGondor particularly North Ithilien. As King Ostoher was growing old, he\ncharged his son Tarostar with driving out the invaders. Gondor endured\nten long years of their attacks until TA 500 when Tarostar, afterwards\ncalled Rómendacil I, the East-victor defeated them ending the long\nperiod violence.\n\nTemporary Cessation of Hostilities\n\nTarostar's victory defeated the invaders but not utterly. The\nEasterlings continued to survive and recoup themselves in Rhûn while\nRómendacil was busy with affairs of the realm. Forty-one years after\ntheir defeat, the Easterlings renewed their attacks on Gondor.\nRómendacil once again led a host against them but was slain in battle\nthat was probably lost by Gondor.\n\nFinal Defeat of the Easterlings\n\nThe Easterling's new threat didn't last long. Rómendacil's son Turambar\nimmediately became King of Gondor. Eager to avenge his father's death,\nTurambar assembled fresh armies and decisively defeated the Easterlings\nin a battle somewhere in the north-east of Gondor in TA 541.\n\nEnd of War and Conquest of Rhûn\n\nAfter his victory over the enemy, Turambar did not disband his armies\nand instead led them into Rhûn. After nine years of campaigning against\nthe Easterlings, his armies finally conquered a large portion of Rhûn in\nTA 550. The conquered territory became the East-lands province of\nGondor.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe aftermath of the First Easterling War left the Easterlings defeated,\nnon-threatening, and not able to make war on Gondor for over 1,300\nyears. It also laid the groundwork for the expansion of the\nrealm of Gondor. The Northmen people of Rhovanion also became later\nallies of Gondor.",

During the\nlate fifth century of the Third Age in TA 490, the Easterlings invaded\nGondor from this land and were at war with Gondor periodically for about\nfifty-one years until King Turambar decisively defeated them in TA 541.\nAfter which, the King led his armies into the land and after about nine\nyears of campaigning there the land became a province of Gondor by TA\n550, and the Easterlings were forced further east.\n\nMiddle years and Loss\n\nThe East-lands remained a part of Gondor for over 1,300 years during\nwhich the province apparently remained well-preserved even during the\ndisastrous Kin-strife. The province suffered heavily during the Great\nPlague. The traditionally hostile Easterlings could have threatened the\nprovince but was not attacked probably because the Easterlings were hit\nhard by the Plague as well.\n\nTwo-hundred years later in TA 1851, the Easterling Wainriders invaded\nGondor thru the East-lands and in TA 1856 the King Narmacil loss a key\nbattle that lost Gondor the East-lands completely for over a thousand\nyears. After this time, the land became a haven of Easterling invaders\nagain who were frequently stirred up by Sauron directly or\nindirectly.\n\nWar of the Ring and Recovery\n\nThe Easterlings allied themselves with the forces of Sauron during War\nof the Ring were defeated along with him and gradually pushed back into\nthe Far Eastern part by King Elessar, and the East-lands once again\nbecame part of Gondor and the Reunited Kingdom\n"

Seeing that he now possessed the two\nmost beautiful things ever created by the Children of Ilúvatar, Thingol\ndesired to combine them into one great creation. From this, he\ncontracted the Dwarven craftsmen working in his smithies who were\nstrongly motivated because the Nauglamir was a creation of their own\nrace, and they too desired the Silmaril but hid it well.\n\nLong did they labor in the deep smithies of Menegroth and when the\nmarvelous creation was complete, King Thingol came to claim it but the\nDwarves coveted it and withheld it from him saying he had no right to\nit. Seeing their true minds, Thingol scorned the Dwarves with hurtful\nwords in praise of himself. Then, the Dwarves unable to bear anymore\nrose before him and slew him then and there took the Nauglamír and the\nSilmaril within it and fled. The killers managed to get out of Menegroth\nbut not out of the realm for word quickly spread on who was responsible\nand the Dwarves were pursued to the death. Most of them were killed and\nthe Nauglamír and Silmaril returned to Doriath. Only two Dwarves\nescaped. Melian, unable to bear the loss of her husband and seeing that\nthat the doom she had so feared had finally come upon Doriath withdrew\nher protection, and entrusted Mablung to send word to Beren at Tol Galen\nand gave him the Silmaril for safe-keeping. She then left Middle-earth\nand returned to Valinor.\n\nPrelude\n\nThe two surviving Dwarves that made it back to Nogrod and when asked\nwhat had happened they lied to their Lord saying that their brethren\nwere slain on the command of Thingol, who intended not to pay them for\ntheir works. Then, great anger came to the Dwarves and the halls of\nNogrod filled with their wrath, and the Dwarves prepared for war\nintending to avenge this wrong. They tried to get the Dwarves of\nBelegost to help but they refused and also tried to dissuade them from\ntheir intent, but they did not succeed. The Dwarves marched westward\nthrough the Beleriand with a great host, and all trembled at the sight\nof host of the Dwarves. They passed through the now open and unguarded\nborders of Doriath, and no one opposed them and retreated before them.\nThen, the host came to Menegroth, crossed the Bridge of Menegroth and\nentered the caves and so the battle begun.\n\nThe Battle\n\nThe battle took place entirely underground in the many thousands of the\nCaves of Menegroth. It is not known how long the two foes fought one\nanother only that many died on both sides but the Dwarves emerged\nvictorious.\n\nAftermath\n\nAfter the Dwarves won the battle, they pillaged and plundered all they\ncould and then eager to get their hands on the Nauglamir and the\nSilmaril, they came to the treasury of the realm and slew Mablung before\nits doors taking both the treasures. Doriath was sacked but the Dwarves\ndid not claim the realm and instead left for home. Doriath ceased to be\nwithout the King or his Queen. Even Beren's avenging of the defeat at\nSarn Athrad did not resurrect the kingdom, not until the coming of age\nof Beren's son Dior. The battle also remained in the racial memories of\nboth the Elves and Dwarves for many ages to come."

    "text": "The WAINRIDER WAR was a war between the Easterling Wainriders with their\nallies and Gondor with its Northmen allies.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nIn the more than 600 years following Minalcar's defeat of the\nEasterlings in TA 1248, the Easterling tribes of Rhûn were no longer a\nthreat as Gondor ruled the lands of the east all the way to the shores\nof the Sea of Rhûn, and Gondor now had the loyalty of the Northmen of\nRhovanion. While during this long period, Gondor switched its\nterritorial ambitions to the south and built a great naval fleet that\nruled the seas. However, the hatred of the Dúnedain and the Men of\nGondor survived in the remaining tribes apparently living further east\nbut the reasons for the unification and attack of these hostile\nEasterling tribes is not known. The only thing that is known is that it\nmust have happened before TA 1851 with no doubt great preparation and\nplanning.\n\nInvasion Begins and Gondor Defeated\n\nIn TA 1851, the Wainriders fell upon Gondor and the realm of\nRhovanion causing much destruction and leaving many dead especially\namongst the Northmen. After five years of attacks, Gondor finally\nassembled an army led by King Narmacil II himself. The battle was lost\nand King Narmacil was slain in it as was his faithful Northman ally\nMarhari. Afterwards, Gondor lost its eastern lands and the realm of\nRhovanion was occupied and enslaved.\n\nRule of the Wainriders\n\nFor forty-five long years, the Wainriders ruled in Rhovanion where they\nbuilt homes, settlements, outposts, and storehouses most likely with the\nuse of forced labor. They also no doubt had freedom of movement between\ntheir conquests in the west and Rhûn that they never had had before,\nwithout opposition from Gondor or anyone else.\n\nThe Beginnings of the Éothéod\n\nAlthough most of the Northmen of the former realm of Rhovanion fell into\nslavery, some survivors of the sack and people made into fugitives by\nthe Wainrider's takeover followed Marhwini, the son of the Marhari\nnorthwest into the Vales of Anduin where they settled. Out of these\npeople came the Éothéod, who opposed the invaders and maintained\nfriendship with Gondor. Surviving the Wainriders rule, they somehow knew\nof the Wainrider's plans and found out that they had grown hunger from\nmore conquests and that there was great hatred of the Wainriders in\nthose that they ruled. By TA 1899, they knew of their plans to attack\nthe Gondor province of Calenardhon from over the Undeeps and gave that\ninformation to the Gondor. They also planned to rouse and assist a\nrebellion in Rhovanion when such an attack begun.\n\nThe Tables Turn\n\nAs the Wainriders prepare for war, the Gondor king Calimehtar sent a\ngreat host against them from out of North Ithilien. With this, the\nWainrider's plans for Calenardhon changed and they sent all against\nGondor. This worked in Gondor's favor as it allowed for the two foes to\nmeet with all force in one place instead of many, leaving the Undeeps\nundefended. Gondor and its Éothéod allies took quick advantage of this\nand sent their own cavalry over the Undeeps, meant to attack the enemy\nfrom behind. The two armies met in Dagorlad, and the Wainriders were\ndefeated with Marhwini's _éored_'''s ''support and with Gondor's cavalry\nassailing them from behind.\n\nThe Wainrider's defeat led to an uprising in Rhovanion by the slaves but\nthe Wainriders were not completely expelled from the west, as they still\nremained in Rhovanion due to the slow progress of the slave rebellion.\nThe Éothéod also continued to harass them from the northwest as well.\nNever-the-less, it was the beginning of the end to the Wainriders hold\non the west.\n\nA New Threat\n\nFor forty-five more years, the Easterling Wainriders were still a\nproblem despite their losses in the west and plotted a new campaign.\nNeeding more support to recoup their losses and defeat Gondor, they\nformed alliances with the Men of Harad and those of Khand. Once again,\nthe Éothéod again warned Gondor of this new threat to the west. In the\nmonth of Cermië of TA 1944, war resumed with the Wainrider alliance\nthreatening Gondor from both the north and the south. Ondoher prepared\nto meet the enemy in the north while Eärnil, his most trusted captain of\narmies prepared to face them in the south.\n\nThe King marched his army out of Ithilien intending to fight the enemy\nonce again on the Dagorland, but is driven to the Black Gate by\nWainriders from Rhovanion and a combined Wainrider/Khand army from Rhûn\ntraveling along the Ash Mountains to battle. There King Ondoher was\nutterly defeated losing his life and his two sons: Artamir and Faramir.\nThere were some survivors of the defeat that scattered south but field\nwas lost.\n\nThe Wainriders occupied Northern Ithilien was no opposition setting up\ncamps. Here, the victors celebrated believing Gondor was at last\ndefeated but it was not true for Eärnil's smaller but well led Southern\nArmy defeated an army of Haradrim in Southern Ithilien, and proceeded to\nmarch north to face the Wainriders. He met up with some of the\nretreating troops of Ondoher's defeated army and fell upon the\nWainrider's camp in a surprise attack. The Wainrider's were completely\ndefeated in a great rout. Those Wainriders that didn't escape back to\nRhûn died in the Dead Marshes. The war was over.\n\nAfterwards\n\nThe Wainrider threat was over and the Northmen realm in Rhovanion was\ncompletely freed and cleared of the invaders and some of these Men\nmigrated to Gondor where they were welcome as distant brethren. In\nTA 1945, Eärnil was crowned King of Gondor. The Éothéod also\nmaintained friendship with Gondor. Gondor's policy switched to\naiding Arnor in the defeat of Angmar.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe Wainrider War led to a series of events that created the Éothéod who\nlater became the Rohirrim. Their long friendship with Gondor led to the\nlater Oath of Eorl taken by their Lord and later King Eorl the Young\nafter coming to the aid of another war against another Easterling\nthreat, and the afterwards granting of Calenardhon to his people which\nafterwards became Rohan.\n",

However, Gondor never faced them in any major open battle\nsolely on their own preferring to rely on their allies to check the\ninvaders. This changed when word reached Minalcar, the Regent of Gondor\nthat some of their Northman allies were unreliable and at times fought\non the side of the Easterlings out of promises of a share in the spoils\nof war, greed, or out of the need of allies to aid in the settling of\nfeuds between their princes.\n\nThe Battle\n\nFinding this situation unacceptable, Minalcar assembled a great army and\nmarched it out of Gondor and met a large Easterling army somewhere\nbetween Rhovanion and the Sea of Rhûn. Minalcar utterly defeated them\nwith possibly only minimal losses. The losses however for the\nEasterlings were devastating as Minalcar's armies obliterated all their\nencampments east of the Sea of Rhûn, threatening both the realm of\nRhovanion and Gondor.\n\nAftermath\n\nMinalcar's victory marked the end of the Second Easterling War putting\nan end to any further attacks by the Easterlings on Gondor and the\nNorthman realm of Rhovanion, as well as their influence on its people.\nMinalcar declared himself 'Rómendacil' increasing his popularity at\nhome. Gondor's victory led to the west shore fortifications on the\nAnduin and the building of the Argonath. The Northman of Rhovanion were\nalso brought under full influence of Gondor.\n"

The earlier king was the first to fully\nembrace the necessity of a strong navy, and through its use extended the\ninfluence of Gondor around the Mouths of Anduin. On March 13 3019,\nshortly before the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, some hundreds of\nfishermen went to aid Minas Tirith without a captain. Much later,\nAragorn vanquished a brief Umbarian invasion of the area. Aragorn, along\nwith Grey Company and the Army of the Dead, liberated Pelargir and the\nsurrounding Anduin estuary from the Corsairs of Umbar, after having\nprogressively pushed them out of the delta for much of that week.\nBecause the victory on 13 March was so complete, Umbar was left with no\ntools to effect its sovereignty. Thus, what might be thought of as the\n“Battle of Ethir Anduin” led directly to Umbar's reintegration with\nGondor in Aragorn's Reunited Kingdom.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe land on the delta was long settled by Men, and indeed it was a rich\nsource of Mannish culture. Part of the reason for this was because it\nwas contested between different types of Men, probably including groups\nlike the Nandorians and Haradrim, but definitely including\nNúmenóreans, Gondorians and Umbarians. Early Westron was said to have\ndeveloped there. The reason for the region's importance to the\ndevelopment of Mannish language was likely because the lands of the\ndelta supported Men of all stations in life, from lowly “lesser men” who\nwere largely fishermen and other folk dependent on the sea, as well as\nthe loftier Númenóreans."

From TA 830 to TA 1149, these kings\nworked hard at, and were largely successful at, adding territory to\nGondor with their increasingly superior naval might. The Ship-kings\npushed the boundaries of Gondor to the south and to the west, such that\nGondor came to include land down to the Mouths of Anduin and Umbar and\neven south of the River Harnen. Indeed, it was under the Ship-kings that\nGondor achieved the zenith of its influence, at least until the\ncoming of Aragorn and the Reunited Kingdom.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFalastur began the building of great fleets of ships that increased\nGondor's power in Middle-earth down past the Mouths of Anduin. Eärnil I\nrebuilt the ancient haven of the Faithful Pelargir and from here built a\ngreat fleet to conquer the enemy realm of Umbar. In TA 933, Eärnil's\nnavy and armies attacked Umbar and won it from the Southrons and their\nBlack Númenórean masters. Afterwards, it became an important part of\nGondor, serving as a great harbor and fortress of Gondor. During\nHyarmendacil I's time, the Kingdom of Gondor reached its highest peak\nand the realm extended from the Field of Celebrant, to the borders of\nMirkwood, to the west of the Greyflood, just east of the Sea of Rhûn,\nsouth of the river Harnen, and finally to the coastal province of Umbar.\n\nThe Ship-kings ushered in a 'Golden Age' bringing Gondor great power and\nwealth. At this time, the Men from the Vales of Anduin and those of the\nsouth acknowledged its authority and did homage to it. Mordor was well\nwatched and the fortresses built to watch over it were well-manned and\nmaintained and it remained desolate and unpeopled. The line of\nShip-kings ended with the death Hyarmendacil I leaving behind a great\nempire that his son Atanatar II and subsequent later successors, did\nlittle to maintain."

The battle was fought for control of the major\nGondorian fortress-city of Minas Ithil, in the east of Gondor; and was\nthe first engagement of the War of the Last Alliance.\n\n\nCauses\n\nWhen Númenor was sunk in SA 3319, the Elendili escaped and founded\nthe Realms in Exile in SA 3320. In the southern kingdom of Gondor,\nAnárion founded the city of Minas Anor and Isildur Minas Ithil, where he\nplanted the White Tree. Minas Ithil was a fortress-city strategically\nbuilt in the Ephel Duath to threaten Mordor. After Númenor was sunk,\nSauron secretly returned to Mordor and mustered a huge army of Orcs,\nTrolls and Evil Men within Mordor, desiring to once more go to war with\nthe West now that Númenor was destroyed.\n\n\nThe Battle\n\nIn SA 3429, Sauron sent a huge army from Gorgoroth to besiege Minas\nIthil. An army of Gondorians under Isildur defended the city. In the\ncourse of the siege, Sauron's forces drove into the fortress and set\nfire to the White Tree. Isildur, his wife, his sons, and an unknown\nnumber of Gondorian soldiers escaped the citadel, and Isildur brought\nwith him a seedling of the White Tree. Isildur's family retreated to\nElendil, while Anárion, hearing of the fall of Minas Ithil, sent a\nstrong force to garrison Osgiliath in the advent of attack.\n\n\nAftermath\n\nFollowing the capture of Minas Ithil, the Army of Mordor terrorized the\nEastern side of the Anduin, then a territory of Gondor. The battle\nsparked the War of the Last Alliance, and led to the Western kingdoms\nforming an alliance to, so they hoped, stop Sauron once and for all.\nMinas Ithil was retaken a year later, but by the Third Age, the citadel\nwas nearly abandoned.

Their language appears\nto be based on an ancient form of Common Eldarin, later enriched by\nQuenya and Sindarin, although it includes many unique 'tree-ish'\nadditions.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOld Entish\n\nOriginally, the Ents had a language of their own, described as long and\nsonorous.

The only extant sample,\na-lalla-lalla-rumba-kamanda-lindor-burúme, the word for hill (or\npossibly even just part of the name of a specific hill), was described\nas a very inaccurate sampling. Even the Elves, master linguists, could\nnot learn Old Entish, nor did they attempt to record it due to its\ncomplex sound structure. The grammar structure of Old Entish was also\nquite bizarre, often described as a lengthy, long-winded discussion of a\ntopic. There may not even have been a word for yes and no: such\nquestions would be answered by a long monologue on why the Ent in\nquestion did or did not agree with the Ent who asked the question. Ents\nas a rule would say nothing in Old Entish unless it was worth taking a\nlong time to say. For everyday language function, they usually resorted\nto “New” Entish.\n\nNew Entish\n\nDue to contact with the Elves, the Ents learned much from them. The Ents\nfound the Elvish language Quenya to be a lovely language, and adapted it\nafter their fashion to everyday use. However, they basically adapted\nQuenya vocabulary to Old Entish grammatical structure. Thus, unlike Old\nEntish, the individual words of “New Entish” that characters such as\nTreebeard spoke were easily translatable.\n\n\nWords and Translations\n\nMost of the Entish words and vowels are almost entirely based on Quenya\nand Sindarin, the two most common languages spoken by the Elves.\n\nde:Entisch ru:Язык энтов"

Cardolan did not oppose this as there the Dúnedain had grown few,\nbut the kingdom of Rhudaur resisted the claim by Argeleb, led by an evil\nhill-chief who was in secret league with Angmar. At this, Argeleb\ndecided to fortify the Weather Hills to resist an invasion from the east\nby the forces of Angmar and Rhudaur, but he was slain in battle in the\nyear TA 1356 along the frontier.\n\n\nPrelude\n\nIn 1409 the Witch-King of Angmar led a great host across the river\nHoarwell against land of Cardolan, after being beaten back out of the\nlands of the Dúnedain many years before.\n\nThe son of Argeleb, King Arveleg I continued his fathers defence against\nAngmar along the fortified Weather Hills, the Great East Road, and the\nlower Hoarwell, and for many years he held back the assaults of Angmar\nand Rhudaur. It was also at this time that the Elven haven of Rivendell\nwas besieged by the forces of Angmar. Arnor's capital of Fornost lay\nupon the North Downs only a few dozen miles away from the Weather Hills,\nand Angmar sought a way to break through the frontier and lay siege to\nthe city. It was to this end that in the year TA 1409 a great host came\nout of Angmar, and crossing the river it entered Cardolan and surrounded\nAmon Sûl. After a fierce siege the Dúnedain of Arnor were defeated, the\ntower of Amon Sûl destroyed, and King Arveleg slain. However, the\nWitch-king's victory was not complete, as the palantír of Amon Sûl, the\ngreatest of the three in the north, was carried back in retreat to\nFornost.\n\nAfter the destruction of Amon Sûl, the power of Arnor to resist the army\nof Angmar was severely weakened. The tower's destruction meant that the\narmy of Angmar had now made the fortified line along the Weather Hills\nuntenable, and its forces gained easy access to the heart of Arnor.\nRhudaur was now absorbed by Angmar and populated by evil men subject to\nthe Witch-King. The few Dúnedain who remained were either slain or fled\nfar westwards, never returning to the lands now claimed by Angmar. The\nkingdom of Cardolan was ravaged by the forces of Angmar who entered its\nnorthern borders uncontested by the crippled army of Arthedain, and its\npeople fled into hiding on the ancient Barrow Downs, or Tyrn Gorthad in\nSindarin. It was in this desperate defence against Angmar that the last\nprince of Cardolan fell in battle, and he was entombed by the survivors\namong his people in what some say was the very same barrow that Frodo\nand his companions had been imprisoned during the War of the Ring.\n\nAlthough the situation was dire, the young King Araphor, son of Arveleg,\ndefended the city of Fornost against the host of Angmar. Although he was\nstill a youth by the reckoning of his people, Araphor proved valiant,\nand with the help of Círdan of Lindon he repulsed Angmar's army from the\nNorth Downs and won a great victory. It was at this time that Angmar was\nsubdued by Elven-folk from Lindon, Rivendell, and even Lothlórien for\nElrond had brought help over the passes of the Misty Mountains. At the\nsame time, the Stoors (one of the three peoples who were named Hobbits)\nwho had previously dwelt in the angle between the Hoarwell and the\nLoudwater fled south-westwards because of the wars and the dread of\nAngmar, and because the land and clime of eastern Eriador worsened and\nbecame unfriendly. Some of these returned to Wilderland in Rhovanion and\ndwelt alongside the banks of the Gladden, becoming a riverside people of\nfishers, but others migrated westwards to a land known by the Dúnedain\nas Sûza, which the Stoors named the Shire. These peoples were granted by\nthe eleventh king of Arthedain, Argeleb II, land that had become\nsparsely populated by war, and dwelling there as a people became the\nHobbits known by the end of the Third Age for their love of peace and\ndomesticity.\n\n\nAftermath\n\nAmon Sûl was the main defensive outpost in the Weather Hills and\nnorthern Cardolan. With it gone the Witch-King was able to take and\nravage Cardolan, as well as consolidate his new conquests in Rhudaur,\nwhich his Hill-Men allies and subjects had taken, as well as launch\nattacks against the whole of Arthedain.\n\nHowever despite permanently ending the threat that was Cardolan, Angmar\nwas unable to ride its momentum, and was driven away from the city of\nFornost and the North Downs by the forces of the new King Araphor and\nLord Círdan of Lindon.\n"

    "text": "The CORSAIR WARS were a long, predominately naval struggle between Kings\nand Stewards of Gondor and a series of renegade rebel forces based at\nUmbar and Pelargir.\n\n\nHistorical Background\n\nThe fortress haven of Umbar was founded by Númenórean colonists during\nthe Second Age, during the peak of Númenorean power. When Ar-Pharazôn\nthe Golden landed in Middle Earth to challenge the power of Sauron, he\nlanded at this heavily fortified port city. After the Downfall of\nNúmenor, these colonists continued to be influenced by Sauron, and\nshowed great antipathy to the exile Kingdoms founded by the Faithful of\nNúmenor, Arnor and Gondor. They became known forever afterward as the\nBlack Númenoreans, battling Gondor by land and sea. It is likely that\nUmbar was conquered for Gondor under one of the Ship-Kings, possibly by\nTarannon Falastur. During the reign of Earnil I and his son, Ciryandil,\nthe Haradrim constantly laid siege to Umbar and in T.A. 1015, Ciryandil\nhimself was slain defending it. This caused his son to conquer Harad and\neventually take the name, Hyarmendacil I.\n\n\nEarly Years\n\nIn the aftermath of the Kin-strife, the great civil conflict between\nEldacar and the usurper Castamir, Castamir's sons fled to to Umbar.\nThere they established a breakaway government in opposition to Gondor,\nand continued to clash with Gondor for centuries to come.\n\n\nPelargir Battles\n\nIn T.A. 1551, Hyarmendacil II conquered Harad when his father, Aldamir,\nwas slain in a skirmish with the Corsairs. However, Umbar held out\nagainst Hyarmendacil's attacks, but suffered grievously.\n\nIn T.A. 1634 the Corsairs learnt that King Minardil, son of\nHyarmendacil, was holidaying in the port city of Pelargir.\n\nLater the Corsairs staged a surprise attack, and Minardil was slain\nbefore he could organise a proper defence of the port. The Corsairs then\nmade a sudden withdrawal.\n\nUnfortunately for Gondor, Pelagir remained a prime target for the\nCorsairs throughout the rest of the Third Age, and by the time of the\nWar of the Ring, the city was a shadow of its former glory.\n\n\nThe Siege of Umbar\n\nThis may refer to several different events in history, when Umbar\nconstantly changed hands between Gondor, and the Corsairs with their\nHaradrim allies.\n\nThe first time Umbar was involved with the wars between Gondor and Harad\nwas when one of the Ship-Kings conquered it from the Haradrim and Black\nNumenoreans who resided there. At this point, Harondor was still under\nGondorian control so it can be assumed that perhaps Umbar was connected\nby land to Gondor, and not just a port outpost surrounded by enemies.\n\nThe wars with Harad never ceased and in T.A. 1015 the Haradrim staged an\nassault on Umbar and King Ciryandil was slain defendings its walls.\nAlthough the port was not taken, it effected the Gondorian populace and\nabove all else, Ciryaher, Ciryandil's son. 35 years later, King Ciryaher\nnot only lifted the Siege of Umbar, but conquered a huge portion of Near\nHarad, crushing the power of the Haradrim.\n\nFor the next four hundred years, Umbar was to remain in Gondorian\ncontrol until after the Kin Strife, when the Sons of Castimir fled\nPelagir and seized Umbar for their own. This proved to be the start of\nGondor's rapid decline.\n\nAldamir, son of Eldacar, still holding a grudge against Castimir and his\nsons for the murder of his brother in the burning of Osgiliath,\nassaulted Umbar and was slain in the process, but the Corsairs victory\nwas soon avenged when Vinyarion, Aldamir's son, conquered Harad and laid\nsiege to Umbar.\n\nBut Gondor's temporary territorial claims in the south were soon\nreversed when the Gondorian siege of Umbar was lifted and the Corsairs\nraided Pelagir, killing King Minardil in the process.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Plague, both sides were temporarily\nweakened, but Telumehtar of Gondor struck first and conquered Umbar for\nGondor, the last descendants of Castimir perished in the process.\n\nIt is never stated when the Corsairs reconquered Umbar, but it is likely\nthat it fell back to the Corsairs sometime during the reigns of the next\nfew Kings, when Gondor itself was nearly toppled by Wainriders."

Even centuries\nbefore the beginning of the war, the Dragon Scatha had stolen treasure\nfrom the Dwarves and kept it in his hoard; unfortunately, Scatha was\nslain by Fram of the Éothéod, who kept the treasure for himself.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nIn TA 2570, the Dragons made war on the Dwarves of the Grey Mountains,\nsacking and plundering their halls and mines. The war lasted for almost\ntwenty years, but in TA 2589 the Dragons attacked the halls of King Dáin\nI, and outside city a great Cold-drake killed the king and his second\nson Frór.\n\nAfter this defeat, most of Durin's folk abandoned the Grey Mountains.\nKing Thrór and some of his followers went back to the former Dwarven\ndwelling of the Lonely Mountain, while his younger brother Grór led\nothers to the Iron Hills.\n\n\nAftermath\n\nThe Dwarves of the Iron Hills, as well as the Dwarves of the Lonely\nMountain, managed to prosper for the following couple of centuries.\nHowever the threat of Dragons would revisit their history: in TA 2770,\nSmaug flew south from the North “like a hurricane” and attacked the\nwealthy Dwarven Kingdom."

    "text": "The DUEL IN DOL GULDUR is a battle that took place in Dol Guldur between\nSauron and Gandalf. After investigating the tombs of the Nazgûl in the\nHigh Fells of Rhudaur, Gandalf entered the old fortress of Dol Guldur\nand bring forth the evil. That was when he was ambushed by strange\nfigure who was revealed to be Thrain, son of Thrór and father of Thorin\nOakenshield. Gandalf saved him bu removing the insanity and planned to\nget him out of the fortress. However, their efforts came to late when\nthey were ambushed by Azog and group of Guldur Orcs that prevented them\nfrom escaping. Gandalf and Thrain managed to elude them, but they both\nencountered the Sauron, who killed Thrain and managed to beat Gandalf.\nAfter subduing the wizard, Sauron revealed himself, much to Gandalf's\nhorror.\n\n\nBiography\n\nPrelude\n\n In TA 2941, Gandalf was forced to abandon Company of\nThorin Oakenshield near the borders of Mirkwood and travel to the High\nFells of Rhudaur, the eastern part of Arnor. After leaving the Company,\nGandalf reaches the High Fells, revealed to be a chamber built\nprecariously into the side the a mountain and barred by an iron gate,\nwhich has been ripped open violently. As Gandalf steps inside, he slips\nand begins sliding down a slanted chute leading to a bottomless chasm,\nnearly falling to his death but managing to land on a narrow staircase\nbuilt into the wall at the base of the chute just in time. It is\nimmediately revealed that High Fells was neither meant to be found nor\nleft once entered, but Gandalf continues his descent down into the\ndarkness nonetheless. He managed to reach one of the a chamber built\ninto the wall whose iron gate has also been crudely smashed, where it is\nrevealed to hold a tomb whose massive stone lid broken has been broken\nin two from the inside and now lies empty.\n\nWhile trying to solve this alone, Gandalf was startled by the sudden\nappearance of Radagast, who questions why they have chosen to meet in\nthe High Fells. There, Gandalf went on to reveal much of the tombs and\nthat the chamber had been designed to hold a being whose name has long\nbeen forgotten, and would be known only as a “servant of evil.” Gandalf\nthen shines his staff down the chasm to reveal the presence of eight\nsimilar chambers, all similarly broken out of by their captors,\nindicating that the chamber is the prison of the Nazgûl, the nine\nservants of the Dark Lord Sauron. As they left the Fells, Gandalf and\nRadagast discuss the Nazgûl's reawakening, and Gandalf asserts that they\nhave been summoned to Don Goldur by the Necromancer. When Radagast\nasserts that no human sorcerer could possess such powerful dark magic,\nGandalf relays his growing suspicion that the Necromancer is actually\nSauron in disguise, but was still too weak to assume his true form, as\nthe Nazgûl only answer to their one true master. When Gandalf decided to\nreturn to the dwarven company and meet them at the slopes of Erebor,\nRadagast insists that they must investigate Dol Guldur at once. Gandalf\ncounters that the dwarves are in great danger without him, but Radagast\nreminds him that if Sauron has indeed returned, the entire world would\nsoon be in great danger.\n\nEncounter with Thrain\n\nReluctantly convinced by Radagast's words, the two wizards arrive near\nthe entrance of Dol Guldur. Radagast seems uncertain that the fortress\nis occupied, but Gandalf immediately recognises that a spell of\nconcealment lies on the Hill of Sorcery. Before entering the fortress\nhimself, Gandalf ordered Radagast to warn Galadriel of their discovery.\nRadagast warned him that it could be a trap, but Gandalf denied and\nenters the fortress at once. Upon entering, Gandalf began to chant\nspells in Quenya to bring forth all hidden evil and remove the shroud of\nconcealment. While Azog and his army remained hidden, Gandalf continued\nto investigate deep in the abandoned fortress, but that was not until he\nencountered a strange diminished figure who had been following the\nwizard. The figure was known to be an insane dwarf and jumped down onto\nGandalf and attacked him under his madness. The two engage in battle\nuntil the wizard managed to to restrain him and used his power to bring\nback his senses.\n\nAfter Gandalf healed the dwarf from his madness that infected him, he\nwas so surprised and relieved that the dwarf was revealed to be Thráin,\nson of Thrór. Thráin began to remember what had happened to him and\nrealized that he was in Dol Guldur for a long time. Before leaving the\nold fortress, Thráin wanted to know if the map and key (that he gave to\nGandalf) were kept safe, but when the wizard told him that he gave the\nitems to Thorin who was embarked on the Quest of Erebor, Thráin was\nshocked by this and told Gandalf that his son, nor anyone, must never\nenter the mountain due to the sickness that lied upon the treasure.\nGandalf also discovers that the last of the Seven Dwarf Rings is\nmissing, and Thrain remembers how he lost it to Azog when he brutally\ncut off his ring finger.\n\nDuel in the Fortress\n\nAt around nightfall, Thráin helped Gandalf navigate through the fortress\nand continued to explain to him that Smaug and The One were in league\nwith each other until Azog himself launched a surprise attack and was\nable to stun Gandalf and scatter his staff and sword. Gandalf however\nwas able to reclaim his staff and easily repelled Azog with a\ntelekinetic force, enraging the pale orc. Gandalf keeps Azog and his\norcs at bay with his staff and demands to know where Sauron is, to which\nAzog replies “he is everywhere”. Gravely outnumbered, Gandalf used a\nflash spell for him and Thráin to flee from the orcs; he either\nteleported or simply ran away afterwards. Gandalf and Thráin make their\nescape, but are soon pursued by a group of Warg-riders. Gandalf uses his\nstaff to strike a wall; the resulting blast crumbles an entire tower\nthat crashes down on the Warg Riders and breaks the bridge. As they soon\nreached the entrance, Gandalf and Thráin found a cloud of darkness\nbarring their way out. It was the Necromancer, who warned “there is no\nlight which can defeat the darkness”. Seeing no way out, Thráin told\nGandalf to tell Thorin that he loved him, to which Gandalf replied he\ncould tell Thorin himself once they got out of there. Despite Gandalf's\nattempts to protect him, Thráin was sucked into the black mist and\nconsumed by the Necromancer.  After Thráin's death, Gandalf and the Necromancer engage\nin a battle of light and dark as the Necromancer launches a barrage of\nshadow energy at Gandalf, who repels it with a force field of light\npowered by his staff which makes his crystal grow with great light in a\nsmall radius. The Necromancer repeatedly launches himself at Gandalf's\nmassive spherical light shield, while Gandalf struggles to maintain it.\nSauron forces the shield to dissipate, but Gandalf conjures it again to\nhold off the dark energy. When Gandalf manages to push the energy\nfurther away from him, it stacks up and breaks through the shield a\nsecond time. Exhausted, Gandalf holds up his staff as a physical shield\nagainst his foe. The Necromancer then approaches him in a flaming\nspectral form, and the flames disintegrate Gandalf's staff. The smoke\nand flames telekinetically pin him against a wall, most of which\ncollapses from the surging energy. At this point the Necromancer can be\nseen as a figure with a horned helmet, in an aura of fire resembling a\ngreat eye. Gandalf's worst suspicions are confirmed as the Necromancer\nreveals himself to indeed be Sauron. Gandalf is later imprisoned in a\ncage and watches in horror as Azog's army of Guldur Orcs march towards\nthe Lonely Mountain."

The party reached the mountain later that\nyear on Durin's Day and sent Bilbo in through the secret door to carry\nout his duty as their burglar. Bilbo had already done some exploration\nof the old hallways using the Back Door and had stolen a golden cup from\nthe treasure. By this deed and by Bilbo's bold speech Smaug's anger was\nkindled. Erroneously believing, due to some remarks Bilbo had made\nduring his conversation with Smaug, that some scheme of the people of\nEsgaroth was the reason for the Dwarves' (and Bilbo's) presence, Smaug\nflew to Esgaroth to show them who is “the true King under the Mountain”.\n\nFire and Water\n\nSmaug appeared first in the north, his light turning the Lake golden. At\nfirst, the Lake-men thought it was gold flowing down the river, but a\ngrim-voiced man named Bard realized that it was the Dragon, awake and\nroused to wrath. At his warning, the bells were rung, and the town\nprepared for battle, by cutting off the bridge, covering the roofs with\nwater, and filling every vessel with water. When Smaug arrived, he tried\nto land on the bridge only to find it destroyed, and instead flew over\nthe town, spouting flames and smashing buildings with his tail.

    "page_id": "35831",
    "text": "The WAR BETWEEN ROHAN AND DUNLAND was a war fought between Rohan and the\nDunlendings in the late Third Age.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nEver since the former Gondor province of Calenardhon was awarded to the\nRohirrim by Cirion for the faithful loyalties of their founder Eorl the\nYoung instead of them, the Dunlendings remained forever hostile. For in\nthe building of their kingdom, the Rohirrim forced these uncivil and\nbarbaric Men out of their settlements in the northern valleys at the\nfoot of the White Mountains and the plains of what would become western\nRohan. They frequently raided Rohan and were always a source of trouble\nto it. However, the Rohirrim and Dunlendings still had to live side by\nside with one another and apparently intermingled and intermarried and\nhad peace for a time.\n\nIn the twenty-eighth century of the Third Age, a man known as Freca,\nsaid to have both Rohirrim and Dunlendish blood rose in power and wealth\nand lorded over the Dunlendings on both sides of the disputed Adorn\nriver. He peacefully cooperated with the Kings of Rohan and was supposed\nto obey the king's summons and attend his councils; however, in later\nyears when he sought the throne of Rohan, he grew arrogant and only came\nwhen he felt like it.\n\nPrelude\n\nIn TA 2754, Freca, drunken with pride and ambition he boldly rode into\nthe King's house with a force of men for a meeting. Freca began making\ndemands to King Helm that his son Wulf should be wedded to Helm's\ndaughter which would no doubt give he and his family power. Helm refused\nand insulted him before his men. Humiliated, Freca flew into an angry\nrage nearly starting a fight in the hall. Helm finally met him face to\nface outside of Edoras in a field and after insulting him further struck\nhim down with one blow from his fist, and he died soon afterwards. Still\nfurious, Helm proclaimed all of Freca's successors the enemy of\nRohan.\n\nWar and Siege\n\nFour years later in TA 2758, the Dunlending led by Wulf came for their\nrevenge at a time when Gondor could not help them. Rohan was invaded\nfrom the east and from Isengard assembling in great force at mouths of\nthe rivers Lefnui and Isen. The armies of Rohan were defeated. Edoras\nwas conquered and Wulf sat in the Meduseld calling himself King of\nRohan. The Dunlendings were cruel, taking slaves and forcing the\nsurviving Rohirrim to flee to the dales in White Mountains and Helm fled\nto the Hornburg taking great losses but the worse was yet to come. A\nlong and terrible winter fell upon all of Middle-earth affecting both\nsides. Helm and his loyal remnant of Rohirrim endured a long siege\nthroughout the long winter bringing terror to the enemy, but in time he,\nhis sons, and followers perished in the cold or in battle.\n\nWhen the Long Winter was over Fréaláf Hildeson, Helm's nephew came down\nfrom Dunharrow with a small force and regained the Meduseld and retook\nEdoras. Wulf was slain and soon all the remaining enemy forces were\ndriven out with the help of Gondor whose forces were now able to help\ntheir ally.\n\nAfterwards\n\nFréaláf Hildeson now became King of a second line of Kings in Rohan.\nSaruman also came to Rohan proclaiming friendship, wooing the new king\nwith gifts, and praising their victory over their enemies and for many\nyears appeared on the outside to be Rohan's friend, living peacefully in\nIsengard. Helm's body was brought down from the Hornburg and buried in\nthe ninth mound of the Kings of Rohan. Rohan was weakened for many years\nto come but so were its enemies and so no further threat of invasion\ncame again. Years after, King Folcwine restored the realm to its former\nstrength.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe defeat of Dunlendings in the war left behind bitter memories in the\nDunlendings who continued to hate Rohan and its rulers. They still\ncoveted the land of Rohan that they failed to capture for themselves. So\nhundreds of years later when the fallen Wizard Saruman became powerful\nand hostile to Rohan, they joined with him and his allies to harass\nRohan during the War of the Ring.\n",

The populace fled to\nthe dales in White Mountains to escape death or slavery. Their they took\nrefuge while King Helm and a modest group of loyal followers not willing\nsurrender or flee, fled to the Hornburg, a fortress in the White\nMountains. There began a deadly siege.\n\nUnder Siege\n\nWithin the fortification, Helm endured the enemy but the worst was yet\nto come. The Long Winter that began in November, 2758 brought heavy\nsnows and freezing colds. The terrible weather brought hardship to both\nsides and there was great hunger to near starvation during the Yule. The\nhardship and suffering led Háma, the son of Helm to attack the enemy and\nlook for food without the approval of the king. He and his company were\nlost in the snow. What followed afterward is unclear and possibly part\nlegend but apparently the resistance continued. For it was said that\nHelm himself grew terrible and fierce during the hardships of the siege.\nIt was said that he continued defending the Hornburg, apparently on just\nhis own dreadful personality with great losses. It was also said or\nimplied that he alone was left to defend the Hornburg, and that he would\noften go out alone in a mad frenzy apparently without any weapons\nslaying his enemies with only his bare hands, and seemed nearly\nunstoppable. Because of this apparent dread, all enemies retreated from\nthe Deeping Coomb. Despite all this, the defenders still perished\nincluding Helm.\n\nAfterwards\n\nOne day near the end of the winter, the Dunlendings heard his horn but\nneither he or any of his men appeared. When the sun broke the sky, Helm\nwas found on the dike frozen to death. It is not known if the\nDunlendings entered the Hornburg as victors but they probably did not\ndue to the fear of the ghostly terror of Helm's spirit, that had spread\namongst them.\n\nLegacy\n\nHelm's finial stand in the Hornburg led Rohan's enemies to fear ever\nafter the sound of his name and his horn. This fear was used again\nagainst Rohan's enemies during the War of the Ring when Saruman's Army\nbesieged the Hornburg during the Battle of the Hornburg, when the horn\nwas sounded as a sign of Théoden desire to continue resisting the\ninvaders despite the odds.",

What news of Boromir the bold? For he is long away.’\n‘Beneath Amon Hen I heard his cry. There many foes he fought, His cloven\nshield, his broken sword, they to the water brought.

Tolkien which explains\nthe shift from the monograph (letter) _þ_ (as in English 'thing') to ''s\n''in the spoken 'Exilic' Elven dialect of Quenya, and how this\nphonological change became connected to broader circumstances. Also\nincluded, however, are lengthy 'excursuses' from this essay regarding\nElven 'mother-names', the parentage of Gil-galad, the westward migration\nof the Edain, and the names of various prominent Noldor. There is\nadditionally a portion of the main body of the chapter that tells of\nGaladriel.\n\nThe premise of the discussion in this chapter is the 'anomolous' use of\n_s_: Tolkien reasons that since in Sindarin (the vernacular tongue of\nthe Noldor after their exile) þ was common, the change þ > s must have\nbecome widespread before the Noldor left Valinor. And on the basis of\nthe presence of þ in Vanyarin and Telerin, and its retention in written\nExilic Quenya the Noldor must have been able to produce this sound. It\nis thus concluded that the shift from þ to _s_ was “conscious and\ndeliberate”.\n\nWith that established, Tolkien explains the adoption of this linguistic\nchange by the majority of Noldor and its historical context within the\nMiddle-earth canon. Originally, he explains, the lingual change was\ncriticised by loremasters “who pointed out that the damage this merging\nwould do in confusing stems and their derivatives that had been distinct\nin sound and sense had not yet been sufficiently considered”. Chief\namong these 'reactionaries' was Fëanor, who opposed the shift from ''þ\n_to_ s_ because of his attachment to the _þ_ sound, which was due to its\npresence in the mother-name of his mother Míriel, _Þerindë_ (Quenya for\n'Needlewoman'). Following the death of Míriel and the antagonism this\nled to between Fëanor and Finwë's children by Indis, this formerly\nscholarly debate became, surprisingly, politicised. The use of _þ_ by\nFëanor and his followers became entrenched, and he saw the growing\nadoption of _s_ by the Noldor, and especially now by Finwë and Indis\nthemselves, as a deliberate insult to his mother and a plot by\nthe Valar to weaken his influence amongst the Noldor. In this way Fëanor\nmade _þ > s_ a political _shibboleth_; he would name himself the 'Son of\nthe _Þerindë', _and he once said to his children, \"_We speak as is\nright, and as King Finwë himself did before he was led astray. We are\nhis heirs by right and the elder house. Let them _sá-sí_, if they can\nspeak no better.\"''\n\n\nNote on the text\n\nThe text comprising this chapter was drawn from a single unfinished\ntypescript of Tolkien's, that included handwritten notes, composed\nsometime after 1968. According to Christopher Tolkien, it would be\ntypical of his father's latest work on the Middle-earth mythology in\nthat the production of new material resulted largely from discursive\nattempts to explain anomalies and unanswered questions in his earlier\nwork, usually concerning philology, which often resulted in a wide\nvariety of subjects being addressed."

    "text": "“THE NAUGLAFRING” is the name of the fourth chapter of _The Book of Lost\nTales Part Two_, which is the second volume of _The History of\nMiddle-earth_. It tells of the earliest version of the tale of the\nNecklace of the Dwarves, the Nauglafring (which later would be named the\nNauglamir), and much of the story does not appear in the Quenta\nSilmarillion. It is not stated by Christopher Tolkien when his father\nfirst had written the tale.\n\nThe chapter that follows is “The Tale of Earendel”.\n\n\nChapter synopsis\n\nAt the Cottage of Lost Play, Ilfiniol suggests that Gilfanon tell to the\nfolk gathered the tale of the Nauglafring, and Gilfanon does so. He\nrecounts the dispute over the gold Húrin had brought to King Tinwelint\n(Thingol) between Tinwelint, Gwendelin his wife, and Ufedhin, one in\nleague with the Nauglath - and the deal made between Tinwelint and the\nDwarves that goes awry and results in a slaughter by the Nauglath over\npossession of the Necklace. In this version of the story, Tinwelint dies\noutside of Artanor in a later battle with the Nauglath (who are under\nNaugladur), alongside Mablung, his hunter.\n\nBeren and Tinúvuel enter this tale when Huan, Tinwelint’s hound, goes\nwandering after the skirmish and brings them the dreadful tidings of the\nfall of Tinwelint’s land by the Orcs and the ransacking by the Dwarves.\nIn grief and anger, Beren summons his fellowship of neighboring elves\nand set out to find the Nauglath. Ufedhin murders Bodruith, the Lord of\nBelegost who was in hiding with Naugladur, and flees. Near Sarnathrod on\na following day, the battle between the Nauglath and Beren’s company\ntakes place, at the end of which Naugladur relinquishes the Necklace to\nhim in turn for his life, but is later is slain by Beren after\nattempting to turn back and kill him. Gwendelin returns to the land of\nLórien, and after many years, the Necklace is stolen away from the reach\nof the sons of Fëanor by Evranin, Elwing’s nurse, and Gereth, a Gnome.\nThe sons of Fëanor’s fates thereafter are narrated, and in conclusion,\nGilfanon tells that these events where what gradually weaved together\nthe great tale of Eärendel, who, within the story, would soon be born of\nElwing.\n\nEditor's commentary\n\nFollowing Gilfanon's narration of this tale of the Necklace, Christopher\nTolkien gives his annotated notes and commentaries on the many\nalterations by his father of character names, places, and circumstances\nthroughout the versions of the tale."

    "text": "'''Aldarion and Erendis: The Mariner's Wife '''is the second chapter in\nPart Two of _Unfinished Tales_. It mainly concerns the first Ship-king\nof Númenor, Tar-Aldarion, and his wife, and how they differed. J.R.R.\nTolkien composed this tale's final form no earlier than 1965.\n\nThe chapter preceding is “A Description of the Island of Númenor”, and\nthe chapter that follows is “The Line of Elros”.\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nAt the beginning of the chapter, Aldarion's father Tar-Meneldur is\ndescribed, as a rightful king devoted to the Island of Númenor, but\nwhose true passion was the study of the stars. He had two daughters and\none son, named Anardil, who would be known among the Kings of Númenor as\n_Tar-Aldarion_.\n\nThrough time, disagreement arose between Aldarion and his father\nconcerning the Sea, for Aldarion loved it ever since he was a child. His\nfirst odyssey towards Middle-earth was made in the year SA 725, under\nthe guidance of Vëantur his own grandfather, and it was during that\njourney upon his ship _Númerrámar_ that he befriended Elves Cirdan and\nEreinion (Gil-galad).\n\nMore sea voyages followed afterwards, against the wish of his father,\nand in between them at one point he founded the Guild of Venturers. In\nthe hundredth year of his life, he was proclaimed heir to the throne,\nand at the celebration of this event he met Erendis, daughter\nof Beregar. Though she seemed beautiful to him, Aldarion refused to\ncommit to marriage because of his commitment to his passion for marine\nlife.\n\nWhen Aldarion finally courted her, it was Erendis who avoided the union,\nfor she did not want to share Aldarion with the sea. Only after many\nyears they were engaged, and even more passed until they were married,\nin the year SA 870. While being husband and wife, they did not manage to\nreconcile their differences. A few years after their only child was\nborn, named Ancalimë, Aldarion continued his explorations in\nMiddle-earth. Erendis grew bitter of the perpetual waiting, until\nfinally she left their home in Armenelos, taking their young daughter\nwith her into the heart of Emerië.\n\nUpon his return, Aldarion found his home locked and his father even more\ncold towards him. It was the same with his wife, when he pursued her to\nher new home. But here the tale takes an unexpected turn, as it is\nrevealed in a letter Gil-galad wrote towards King Meneldur that Aldarion\ndid not leave his home out of selfishness, but rather his voyages were\ncaused by the threat from Sauron, which he had long seen and tried to\nprevent by building the outpost Vinyalondë at the mouth of\nthe Gwathló river in Middle-earth. Tar-Meneldur, realizing that he did\nnot share the visionary mind of his son, nor his capacity to face\nupcoming events, announced his abdication and proclaimed Aldarion as the\nsucceeding King of Númenor.\n\nAldarion's reign ends in the year SA 1075, and his and Erendis' daughter\nsucceeded him as queen. Aldarion's death was two decades following, in\nSA 1098.\n"

Their arrival prompted Varda to create new stars to add to the\ncelestial glory of the earth. At the end of this task, Varda was\nreturning in great haste to Valinor, and she dropped Morwinyon in the\nwest where it blazes high above Arda's edge.\n\nLater in chapter 8, it was said that jewel-makers caught their\ninspiration from the stars and “..._not least did they love Morwinyon of\nthe west, whose name meaneth the glint at dusk._” In the commentary in\nthis chapter, Christopher Tolkien notes that Morwinyon was identified in\nboth the Quenya and Gnomish word-lists as Arcturus. Strangely, it is\nrepresented as always being in the western sky. Apparently in the\nancient mythology of the Elves, not all heavenly bodies moved from East\nto West.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Morwinyon_ is a Quenya word, the roots of which are _moro_, meaning\n“glint in the dark”, and ''gwini - _which has a derivative word _wintil\n- _meaning “a glint”. The Gnomish translation is _Morwinthi_, probably\nconnected to _gwim_ or _gwinc_ “spark, flash” or _gwimla'' “wink,\ntwinkle”."

In later times it was was seen as a symbol of pure-blooded\nnúmenórean descend, as the former free working classes rose to the\nstatus of urban citizens and the lower classes were replaced by unfree\nslaves imported from all over Middle-Earth and a mixed-blooded class of\nunfree and semi-unfree freedmen evolved. The original Adûnai were a tall\nfolk, 6 feet, 4 inches being not uncommon among them, although their\nlater descendants used to be smaller in statue. Most common Adûnai were\nblack or brown haired, being largely descendants of the Beorians and\nHalethrim, but in the royal line there also were some flaxen or\ngolden-haired families, offspring of the house of Hador. Adûnai were\nusually grey-eyed, though brown or blue eyes were not uncommon.\n\n\nReligion\n\nThe Adûnai revered the One-god Êru and his subject-spirits the Avalôi or\nÊru-bêni, especially Gimilnitîr or Avradî and Amân or Adûnakhôr, but\nalso Abâr, Agân, Azâr and Magân.Later under Zigurûn's tutelage they\nlargely abolished the reverence of Êru and made the cult of Alkar or\nMulkhêr their imperial religion, the few remaining faithful or Elendili\nmostly left Númenór for the colonies of the northwest.\n\n\nCulture\n\nThe Adûnai were the greatest Seamen and Scholars among the mortals and\ncertainly also the most skilled artificians and warriors.However with\nthe drowning of Númenór much of the Adûnai's knowledge was lost forever\nand their Dúnadan and Aruwanai descendants only inherited a shadow of\ntheir forefathers' former glory.\n\n\nLifespan\n\nWhile the early half-elven royal line of the númenórean Kings lived up\nto 400 years and even the lesser Númenoreans often lived up to 200\nyears, their Elendili and Aruwanai descendants of the late third age\nonly came to live for no longer than 100 years, 150 years being a sign\nof royal descent, with the notable exception of Elessar I who died at\nthe age of 210.",

They were the\npeoples of the Kingdom of Arnor.  They were descended from the\nNúmenórean colonists who settled there throughout most of the Second Age\nand their noble kin who escaped the destruction of Númenór in SA 3319.\nBeing mostly of Númenórean stock and ruled by exiled Númenórean\noverlords, the people continued most of the customs and traditions of\nNúmenór.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the foundation of Arnor there was already a sizable Númenórean\npopulation living in Eriador, a result of the slow emigration of\nNúmenóreans which had started under Tar-Meneldur and Tar-Aldarion. The\nregion was home to Middle Men of Edainstock, and the early colonists\nsoon interbred with the indigenous population.\n\nThe people of Arnor, the North-kingdom founded by Elendilin Middle-earth\nafter the Downfall of Númenor. Elendil was its first King, and was held\nas High King over both the North- and South-kingdoms (hence the name\n_Arnor_, which means 'Land of the King').\n\nThe Men of Arnor were severely depleted by the War of the Last Alliance,\nin which many of them fell. Nonetheless, the land of Arnor survived for\nnearly a thousand years under ten different Kings. The eldest son,\nAmlaith, claimed Kingship over all Arnor but was reduced to only ruling\nthe region of Arthedainas his kingdom, while the other sons founded the\nkingdoms of Cardolanand Rhudaur. The largest part of the populace were\nEriadorian Commoners, who were ruled by an upper class of Northern\nDúnedain, though there was a broad mixed-blooded middle-class,\nespecially in the urban centers and the lesser Nobility or Gentry.\n\nTheir realms were lost during the Third Age, and for the millennium\nbefore the War of the Ring, they were a wandering people. Their leader,\nwho took the title 'Chieftain', was the descendant of the ancient King,\nIsildur.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, Aragornwas crowned the King of Gondor, and he\nwas also crowned as the King of Arnor, and thus, he became the first\nHigh King of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor.\n\n\nGalleries\n\nUntitled2.png\n\nUntitled3.png Untitled4.png Untitled5.png Untitled6.png Untitled7.png\nHalbarad.jpg\n\nElendil11.jpg|Elendil the Tall Arador card.jpg Arathorn\nlo-rez.jpg|Arathorn in _Born of Hope_ King Aragorn.PNG|Aragone, the\nfirst High King of the Reunited Kingdom Eldarion.jpg",

The poem\nthus appears in that context as a means of identifying Aragorn. Aragorn\nindeed later quotes the first two lines, not knowing the poem is in the\nletter, and this does help to confirm his identity. Bilbo himself\nrecites the poem at the Council of Elrond when Boromir expresses doubts\nabout Aragorn's claim to be the Heir of Isildur.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe first line is clearly a re-working of the traditional proverb “All\nthat glitters is not gold”, reversing its meaning. The second line,\nperhaps one of the lines from Tolkien's work most often quoted out of\ncontext, refers to Aragorn's travels. The third and fourth lines concern\nAragorn's heritage, he is Isildur's heir and his bloodline remained\nhidden from 'frost like terror' of Sauron, in the North as Rangers.\nWhile the remaining lines describe his destiny. The “blade that was\nbroken” refers to the Shards of Narsil, which is indeed remade for\nAragorn into Andúril.\n"

After the rise of Sun, a\nvast plain of green grass stretched across the great plain of Ard-galen\nsouth of the Gates until the end of the Siege of Angband at the\nconclusion of the Dagor Bragollach.

It ran 600 miles\nfrom its source in the Tûr Betark, in the mighty Káraskon Ravine, south\nof Ny Chennacatt, to its delta in the Bay of Ormal. The cities of Sirayn\nwere founded along the Sîresha river and its tributaries.\n\nMeltwater from two glaciers, as well as the torrential rains falling on\nthe mountain peaks, feed its upper reaches to create a fastmoving\ncurrent. The yellowish color of the water is due to the yellow sediment\nor loess eroded from the cliffs of the Tûr Betark. During Sadayn, the\nwettest season, a traveller following the foothills east from\nCiryatandor must detour north to the Mára Gaib (“Bridge of the\nOld-settlers”) to cross the flood-swollen Sîresha. This remarkable\nengineering feat bridges the river at the narrowest point between\nTartaust and Baud Selen.\n\nDropping through the Skara Riskál (“Wraith’s Teeth Rapids”), the river\nis joined at Tartaust by a small tributary and broadens to sweep\nsmoothly along the bottom of a wide gorge. The current passes rapidly\nthrough chasms carved from mesas and rock outcroppings as well as across\nthe vast plains of the scrubland typical of Chennacatt. Just above Rask,\nbefore the Maudar adds its flow to the Sîresha, the river drops in the\nSkara Sársus (“Cougar’s Gullet Rapids”), the last of the white water\nthat makes the upper half of the Sîresha unnavigable.\n\nThe lower Sîresha is a tamer stream, flowing between low banks and\nmeandering in ever greater loops as it approaches the Bay of Ormal. It\nshrugs once more at the ruins of Charnesra, where unusal rock formations\nin the river create lethal undercurrents and an obstructed channel for\nwater traffic.

    "text": "'''You and Me and the Cottage of Lost Play '''was the title of the first\nversion of a poem by J.R.R. Tolkien, written in April 1915 . It is\nalso the earliest mention of the Cottage of Lost Play of Tolkien's early\nprecanonical Middle-earth mythology - two years later, his tale _The\nCottage of Lost Play_, which would become the first of the “Lost Tales”\n, was finished.\n\nMany renditions later, this poem became “The Little House of Lost Play:\nMar Vanwa Tyaliéva”.\n\nThis first version read:\n\n_You and me - we know that land_\n\n_And often have been there_\n\n_In the long old days, old nursery days,_\n\n_A dark child and a fair._\n\n_Was it down the paths of firelight dreams_\n\n_In winter cold and white,_\n\n_Or in the blue-spun twilit hours_\n\n_Of little early tucked-up beds_\n\n_In drowsy summer night,_\n\n_That You and I got lost in Sleep_\n\n_And met each other there -_\n\n_Your dark hair on your white nightgown,_\n\n_And mine was tangled fair?_\n\n_We wandered shyly hand in hand,_\n\n_Or rollicked in the fairy sand_\n\n_And gathered pearls and shells in pails,_\n\n_While all about the nightingales_\n\n_Were singing in the trees._\n\n_We dug for silver with our spades_\n\n_By little inland sparkling seas,_\n\n_Then ran ashore through sleepy seas,_\n\n_And down a warm and winding lane_\n\n_And never never found again_\n\n_Between high whispering trees._\n\n_The air was neither night or day,_\n\n_But faintly dark with softest light,_\n\n_When first there glimmered into sight The Cottage of Lost Play._\n\n_'Twas builded very very old_\n\n_White, and thatched with straws of gold,_\n\n_And pierced with peeping lattices_\n\n_That looked toward the sea;_\n\n_And our own children's garden-plots_\n\n_Were there--our own forgetmenots,_\n\n_Red daisies, cress and mustard,_\n\n_And blue nemophile._\n\n_O! All the borders trimmed with box_\n\n_Were full of favourite flowers - of phlox,_\n\n_Of larkspur, pinks, and hollyhocks_\n\n_Beneath a red may-tree:_\n\n_And all the paths were full of shapes,_\n\n_Of tumbling happy white-clad shapes,_\n\n_And with them You and Me._\n\n_And some had silver watering-cans_\n\n_And watered all their gowns,_\n\n_Or sprayed each other; some laid plans_\n\n_To build them houses, fairy towns,_\n\n_Or dwellings in the trees;_\n\n_And some were clambering on the roof;_\n\n_Some crooning lonely and aloof;_\n\n_And some were dancing fairy-rings_\n\n_And weaving pearly daisy-strings,_\n\n_Or chasing golden bees;_\n\n_But here and there a little pair_\n\n_With rosy cheeks and tangled hair_\n\n_Debated quaint old childish things -_\n\n_And we were one of these._\n\n_But why it was there came a time_\n\n_When we could take the road no more,_\n\n_Though long we looked, and high would climb,_\n\n_Or gaze from many a seaward shore_\n\n_To find the path between sea and sky_\n\n_To those old gardens of delight;_\n\n_And how it goes now in that land,_\n\n_If there the house and gardens stand,_\n\n_Still filled with children clad in white -_\n\n_We know not, You and I._\n\n_And why it was Tomorrow came_\n\n_And with his grey hand led us back;_\n\n_And why we never found the same_\n\n_Old cottage, or the magic track_\n\n_That leads between a silver sea_\n\n_And those old shores and gardens fair_\n\n_Where all things are, that ever were -_\n\n_We know not, You and Me._\n"

This reference can be seen in “Flies and Spiders”, the\neighth chapter of _The Hobbit_, and also in “Errantry” , a poem\nwritten by Bilbo Baggins.\n\nIn real-word mythology, “Faerie” had been the name of the realm of the\nfairy king in the Middle English tale _Sir Orfeo._\n\nAs a concept\n\nWhen discussing what today are referred to as “fairy-tales”, J.R.R.\nTolkien once wrote this explanation of his own use of the word:\n\nThis usage of “Faerie” as a proper noun appears a total of forty times\nin “On Fairy-Stories”.\n\nIn the works of Tolkienian authors later on, this connotation of\n“Faerie” is not often touched on.

Like Tolkien's essay, it deals with the term's contexts and\nmeaning.\n\nWhen discussing Elves and their likeness to angels, Peter Kreeft cites\nTolkien's statements that “Faërian Drama”, which the Elves frequently\npresented to Men, “produce Fantasy with a realism and immediacy beyond\nthe compass of any human mechanism”, and that Fantasy “aspires” to the\nelvish craft, which is enchantment.

    "page_id": "44534",
    "text": "_'_Crist _'_is the name of a set of three 10th century Old English poems\nthat concern Jesus Christ, found in the Anglo-Saxon “Exeter Book”. The\nthree constituent poems have been simply named _Christ I_, ''Christ II\n''(which was known to be written by the poet Cynewulf), and _Christ\nIII_. They concern Christian topics such as Christ's advent and\nascension.\n\n\nRelevance\n\nThe character Eärendil, who at the end of the First Age was responsible\nfor the intervention of the Valar upon Morgoth and Morgoth's subsequent\ndefeat, originated from a seeming revelation Tolkien experienced in 1913\nwhen he first read a particular line from _Christ II_:\n\n Eala éarendel engla beorhtast\n\nofer middangeard monnum sended\n\nIn English, this is closest to meaning _Hail Earendel, brightest of\nangels, sent over middle-earth to mankind!_\n\nTolkien is cited to have said that upon reading this he “_...felt a\ncurious thrill as if something had stirred in me.....There was something\nvery remote and strange and beautiful behind those words, if I could\ngrasp it, far beyond the ancient English._” This moment and\ninspiration is noted by Tolkien scholars to have been important in the\nfirst shaping of the legendarium of Middle-earth as a mysterious\nphilological realization , or even in fact to have been the\nlegendarium's first cause  (since Eärendil was the first character\nto take shape). It prompted Tolkien's writing of a poem initially\nentitled “The Voyage of Éarendel the Evening Star”, of which he would\nwrite five successive versions , starting in September of 1914 .\nFrom the poem would stem _The Tale of Eärendel_ which Tolkien later\ncomposed, also in multiple schemes and emendations, but never completed.\nThis tale became the fifteenth of the posthumously published ''Lost\nTales ''- and it was implied by its narrator, the character Gilfanon, to\nbe the great culmination of all tales that preceded it.\n\n_The Tale of Eärendel_ also evolved into the final climax of _Quenta\nSilmarillion_: the chapter “Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of\nWrath”, in which Eärendil indeed journeys across Middle-earth to and\nfrom the West, seeking and then gaining the help of the Valar, and\ncarrying the morning star across the sky. Two ages after this event,\nFrodo Baggins invoked Eärendil in two different instances - calling him\n“brightest of stars” as the original poem suggested - in the Quenya\noutcries _Aiya Eärendil Elenion Ancalima!_ and _Aiya elenion\nancalima!_.\n\nThe quoted line of Cynewulf from _Christ II_ also inspired Tolkien's use\nof the very term “Middle-earth”.\n"

It was written around 1920.\n\nThe chapter that follows is “The Chaining of Melko”.\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nRúmil finishes telling Eriol of the Music of the Ainur, and Eriol asks\nfor more stories of Valar, but Rúmil refuses, saying that there are too\nmany for him to tell. It is midday, and Eriol contemplates in the\ngarden, exhausted and hungry. Littleheart brings food and bedding for\nEriol. That evening, the party in the Cottage of Lost Play entertain\nthemselves with music and song, until Rúmil agrees to recount to them\nthe Coming of the Valar.\n\nThe Coming of the Valar\n\nManwë and Varda enter Arda with their companions, only to find Melko\nthere inadvertently causing destruction. Manwë becomes upset at this.\nUlmo, Aulë, and Palurien enter after them with their servants, including\nUlmo's vassal, Ossë. Then came the rest of the Valar. Manwë summons the\nValar (except Melko) to council, in order to determine what to do about\nMelko's recklessness. Mandos and Tulkas, both of whom Melko fears, set\nout to deal with him. Tulkas lands an excellent punch on Melko's face,\nand for that Melko nurtured a grudge. He maintains an amicable exterior,\nurging that the Valar go to their own realms. The Valar are perceptive\nof him, however, and instead determine to dwell together, for Arda at\nthis time was a dark place. Aulë asks Melko to make great pillars for\ntwo lamps of light. Melko deceives the Valar, telling the pillars he had\nmade, merely of ice, were in fact indestructible. The lamps, lit by the\nliquid light in the sky, melt thesece pillars, and the Valar escape west\nin the destruction of those lamps. Ulmo is sent to gather the spilled\nlight into two cauldrons named “Kulullin” and “Silindrin”. Two large\npits hold the two cauldrons, into which are put precious metals and\ngems, covered with earth. Palurien, Vána the youthful, and Lórien “of\nDreams” weave spells of power and life about the pits, and from them\nsprout two trees, of gold and silver: “Laurelin” and “Silpion”\nrespectively. These great Trees give light, and all of Valinor is\nilluminated again. The Valar build their homes: Manwë atop the highest\nmountain, a place for Ossë when he grows weary of the waters, Lorien in\ngreat sleepy gardens, Tulkas a place of laughter and feats of strength.\nThus the Valar establish the realm of Aman for their own.\n\nIn the Cottage, one of the listeners (proficient at his current\noccupation) wishes to be in the warlike abode of Makar and his\nsister Meassë, but says he would be better off a guest of Oromë the\nhunter, to the amusement of the others. Lindo the host calls it a night,\nand the group retires to sleep.\n\nOther material\n\nChristopher Tolkien also outlines (without reproducing) an alternative\nstory of the Lamps his father had written, the earliest version of the\ncreation of the Two Trees, a different account of the Valar's mansions,\nand a complicated tale explaining the role of Mandos (named “Vefántur\nMandos”) and the afterlife of Elves and Men. An early poem of J.R.R.\nTolkien's named “Habbanan beneath the Stars” is also included;\n_Habbanan_ was the earliest conception of the land of Araman."

The nobility usually learned\nSindarin, and used it to be polite to other nobles and strangers\nalike. Because it was both an acquired and a learned language, it had\nsome notable differences with “regular” Third Age Sindarin.\n\n\nPhonetical\n\nLike any acquired language, the second language's sound range is\ndirectly influenced by the speaker's original sound range. Westron did\nnot possess _ch_ or _y_, and pronounced them differently.\n\n\n“Y”\n\nThe _y_ was pronounced by Sindarin Elves as IPA , a close front\nrounded vowel. Of all languages, only Sindarin had this sound, so it was\nproblematic for speakers of other tongues. Gondorians generally\npronounced it as an _i_, though it was sometimes substituted with an\n_e_, as in the Gondorian plural for _onod_, _ened_ (rather than the\nusual _enyd_).\n\n\n“CH”\n\nAlso frequent in Sindarin was the _ch_, the velar fricative, which the\nGondorians also encountered among pre-Númenórean placenames such as\nErech and Eilenach.\n\nThe most notable use of the voiceless velar fricative was in the name of\nGondor's new northern neighbour, Rohan. Originally envisioned as\n_Rochand_, in Gondor this became _Rohan_. Though the tongue of the\nÉothéod did possess the voiced _ch_, it adopted the southern use. The\nvoiced velar fricative, which is found in _Rochand_, was pronounced as a\nsounded _h_, while the voiceless variant, at the end of words, was\npronounced as a _k_. Those very learned would pronounce them correct,\nbut forcibly so.\n\n\nPhilological\n\nAnother notable difference from regular Sindarin was purely\nphilological. Those Gondorians learned in lore wished to speak like\nNoldor, and the Sindarin they spoke in the First Age was North Sindarin.\nAt least one feature from North Sindarin was reintroduced: whereas “true\nSindarin of the Elves” changed both the voiced and voiceless combination\nof a sonorant consonant and a spirant to a long sonorant, the Gondor\nSindarin retained the spirant. Thus in the case of the former, _malt_\n(“gold”) and _orn_ (“tree”) became _Mallorn_, in Gondor this remained\n_Malthorn_."

Throughout the First and\nSecond Age, the Grey Mountains had been mined and inhabited by Dwarves\nof Durin's Folk.\n\n\nThe Awakening of Durin's Bane\n\nDurin's folk started to gather in the Grey Mountains in TA 1981 after a\nBalrog was awakened in their ancestral home of Khazad-dûm, which its\npeople fled in fear. Another portion of Durin's folk lead by King Thráin\nI established the Kingdom under the Mountain at Erebor.\n\nSome years after leaving Moria Scatha, the Great Worm of the Ered\nMithrin began to afflict the Dwarves and all who lived in that region,\nuntil Fram of the Éothéod slew him, bringing peace from the Long-Worms\nfrom many years till the War of the Dwarves and Dragons.

A year later most of Durin's folk abandoned the Grey\nMountains. Grór, youngest son of the king went with many followers to\nthe Iron Hills.

Unbeknownst to\nthem, Merry and Pippin were able to escape into the woods.\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe Orc-host had recently attacked the Fellowship of the Ring, killing\nBoromir of Gondor and capturing the hobbits Merry Brandybuck and Pippin\nTook. Among the Orc-host, there was some disagreement on what to do with\nthe hobbits: Uglúk and Grishnákh wanted to search them, while the Moria\nOrcs, called “Northerners,” wanted to just kill them. This disagreement\nslowed down their pace and allowed Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, who were\npursuing them, to gain on them.\n\nAt the same time, scouts sent ahead by the Orcs were seen by a Rohirrim\nscout, who alerted the Éored of Éomer that a large band of Orcs was\ncrossing the Eastemnet, headed for Isengard. Éomer, without official\nsanction from King Théoden, immediately headed for the Orcs.\n\nAt this point, Uglúk and Grishnákh were disagreeing over who would take\nthe prisoners. The Isengarders overtook the Northerners and were joined\nby around 40 Mordor Orcs led by Grishnákh.\n\n\nThe Battle\n\nAs the combined Isengard-Mordor force overtook the Northerners,\nGrishnákh saw Éomer's force riding quickly towards them. The orcs put on\na new spurt of speed, however the riders had already hemmed them in,\npreventing them from scattering, and driving them along the banks of the\nriver. The Rohirrim then used a tactic of shooting stragglers and moving\nout of range of answering bows, which they did many times before\nnightfall. This tactic killed many orcs, and forced the others to run\nfaster, thus tiring them out.\n\nDuring the night, the Orcs stopped on a hillock, but the horsemen had\nsurrounded them near Fangorn. Several orcs went off towards the forest,\nbut only three returned. Uglúk put three Isengarders to guard the\nhobbits, who were told to kill the captives only if the Rohirrim were to\nbreak the circle. During their talk, several Rohirrim crawled over to\nthe camp, killed several orcs, and vanished quickly. As Grishnákh tried\nto escape with Merry and Pippin, he was killed by a spear, which allowed\nMerry and Pippin to free themselves. As the Orcs realized that they had\nlost the hobbits, a group of Isengarders led by Mauhúr, which had come\nout of Fangorn, tried to break the Rohirrim's encirclement. The Rohirrim\ndrew their circle close around the hillock to prevent a sortie, while a\ngroup rode off to attack the reinforcements. The Orcs' reinforcements\nwere soundly defeated, and so the riders returned to their siege.\n\nAt dawn, the riders charged from the East at the Orcs, who shot all the\narrows they had remaining. Although several horsemen fell, the line held\nas they passed over the hill. They wheeled around and charged again.\nMost Orcs now fled helter-skelter and were killed one by one. One band\nhowever, led by Uglúk, charged towards the forest, heading straight for\nthe riders trying to contain them. They charged up the slope, and killed\nthree riders in their way. After watching the battle unfold, Merry and\nPippin escaped into Fangorn. Uglúk, on the other hand, was overtaken by\nÉomer, who dismounted and fought him sword to sword. All the orcs who\ncould still escape were run down and slaughtered by the riders.\n\n\nAftermath\n\nThe Riders built a mound for their 15 fallen comrades, sung their\npraises, and set an equal number of spears around it. They then burned\nthe piled carcasses of the Orcs and scattered their ashes. Pippin and\nMerry were met by Treebeard in Fangorn. Two days later, Éomer's Éored\nencountered Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, who he told of the battle. He\ngave to them two horses whose masters had fallen in the battle, Hasufel\nto Aragorn and Arod to Legolas. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli later traced\nthe Hobbits' steps into Fangorn, and there met Gandalf.",

There is also a\nunfinished (consisting of around 130 lines) and unpublished poem: _The\nLay of the Fall of Gondolin._ Sections of _Of Maeglin_, and name list\nin _Parma Eldalamberon volume 15_.\n\nThe _Lost Tales_ chapter goes more in depth than the account in _The\nSilmarillion_, telling notably in detail of Tuor's and Ecthelion's feats\nin battle, and mentioning every captain of the Houses of the\nGondolindrim.\n\nBackground\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien actually began writing the story that would become “The\nFall of Gondolin” in 1917, in an army barracks on the back of a sheet of\nmilitary marching music. It is more or less the first traceable story he\never wrote down on paper about the Middle-earth legendarium.\n\nBecause Tolkien was constantly revising his First Age stories, the\nnarrative he wrote in 1917 (published posthumously in _The Book of Lost\nTales Part Two_) remains the only full account of the fall of the city.\nThe narrative in _The Silmarillion_ was the result of the editing by his\nson Christopher of various different sources.\n\nA partial new version of “The Fall of Gondolin” was published in the\n_Unfinished Tales_ under the title “Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin”.\nActually titled “Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin”, this narrative shows\na great expansion of the earlier tale. It can be surmised from this text\nthat Tolkien would have rewritten the entire story, but for reasons that\nare not known he abandoned the text before Tuor actually arrives in the\ncity. For this reason Christopher Tolkien retitled the story before\nincluding it in _Unfinished Tales_.\n"

    "text": "The PRINCES OF BELFALAS was a noble title among the Men of Gondor.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the Downfall of Númenor, a family of the Faithful abandoned the\nIsle and travelled to Middle-earth, settling the shoreland between the\nrivers Ringló and Gilrain. This family of Númenóreans were akin to the\nLords of Andúnië and thus related to Elendil. When Elendil himself came\nto Middle-earth and founded the Kingdoms of the Dúnedain, he granted\nthis family a noble title, making them the hereditary Princes of\nBelfalas.\n\nWe have few details of the history of the Princes, though at one time\nthey were powerful enough to give their name to the region where they\nlived: Dor-en-Ernil, the Land of the Prince. The line had definitely\ncome to a formal end by TA 2076, having lasted for more than two\nmillennia, when Galador son of Imrazôr became the first Prince of Dol\nAmroth. This new style continued in use to the end of the Third Age and\nbeyond.\n\nThough there were no further Princes of Belfalas after Galador's time,\nthey remained important in history. In particular, we know that one\nbranch of their descendants removed to Lossarnach. Morwen Steelsheen, a\ndaughter of that family, married Thengel of Rohan. Through Morwen, both\nThengel's heir Théoden and his grandson Éomer carried the blood of the\nancient Princes of Belfalas."

    "text": "The DWARVES OF THE IRON HILLS were Dwarves belonging to the house of the\nLongbeards, otherwise known as Durin's Folk, who lived in the Iron\nHills.\n\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\n\nThe Longbeard Dwarves of Khazad-dûm colonized the Iron Hills in the\nFirst Age. The Hills were their primary source of iron-ore. The\nDwarf-road of Mirkwood ran north-east from Khazad-dûm to the Hills for\nuse by dwarf-traders and merchants.\n\nAfter Sauron destroyed Eregion in the Second Age, the Longbeards sealed\nKhazad-dûm and Orcs took control of the northern Misty Mountains and the\nGrey Mountains. This ended communication between the Iron Hills and\nKhazad-dûm for some time.\n\nThird Age\n\nFounding of Grór's Realm\n\nIn the Third Age, many Longboard Dwarves lived in the Grey Mountains,\nbut they were greatly troubled by Dragons in that region. After King\nDáin I was slain by one of these dragons, his surviving sons led an\nexodus into the east. Dáin's elder son Thrór recreated the Kingdom under\nthe Mountain at Erebor, while his younger brother Grór led a part of the\npeople further into the east to join their kindred living in the Iron\nHills.\n\nGrór settled in the Iron Hills in the year TA 2590 and became Lord of\nthe Iron Hills. During his reign, the realm became the strongest in the\nNorth, being the only realm standing between Sauron and his plans to\ndestroy Rivendell and taking back the lands of Angmar. Also, following\nthe Sack of Erebor many of Durin's folk fleeing from Smaug and those\nwandering in exile, except for Thrór and his small company of family and\nfollowers, came to the Iron Hills, bolstering their numbers.\n\nWar of the Dwarves and Orcs\n\nDuring the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, many Dwarves from the Iron Hills\nfought several battles, but they are mostly remembered from the Battle\nof Azanulbizar in the year TA 2799. Naín and his army came to the battle\nin the most crucial moment when the main Dwarven army was being\ndecimated by the great host of Orcs. With these fresh reinforcements,\nthe Dwarves were able to route and destroy their opponents, fighting\ntheir way all up to the steps of the East-gate of Moria. There, Nain\ndueled with Azog, the Orc commander, resulting in his death. Later in\nthe battle, Dáin II Ironfoot killed Azog out of vengeance for his\nfather, achieving recognition because he was very young by dwarven\nstandards. After this battle, Dain led his Dwarves back to Grór's Halls.\n\nDáin's Reign\n\nGrór ruled the Dwarves of the Iron Hills for 215 years, and he died in\nTA 2805 at 241 years of age. Dáin Ironfoot became the next Lord of the\nIron Hills. During his reign, the Iron Hills evolved to the mightiest\nDwarf-realm of its time.\n\nYears later, Dáin's cousin Thorin attempted to restore the kingdom at\nErebor, but he was trapped by the Elves of Mirkwood and Northmen of\nEsgaroth and sent to the Iron Hills for aid. Dáin arrived with over 500\narmored Dwarves and as events developed, the Dwarves of the Iron Hills\nproved crucial in winning the ensuing Battle of Five Armies against the\nOrcs of the Misty Mountains. Thorin died in that battle, and with him\nthe royal line of Thrór. Through his ancestor Grór, the Kingship of\nDurin's Folk then fell on Dáin. Dáin II Ironfoot removed from the Iron\nHills and re-established a kingdom under the Lonely Mountain. It is\npossible that both Iron Hills and Erebor were ruled by him and later by\nhis son Thorin III Stonehelm.\n\nThe Dwarves of the Iron Hills fought alongside the Dwarves of Erebor in\nthe Battle of Dale against the Easterlings during the War of the Ring.\n\n\nOther information\n\nThey became well-known for making a metal mesh that could be used for\nmaking flexible items like leg-coverings.\n\nThese Dwarves of Durin's folk were known for being some of the most\nfierce and elite of all Dwarf armies capable of matching Sauron's army\non equal footing. Their main weapon of choice seemed to have been the\nmattocks, though they also carried a short broad sword with a round\nshield.\n\nNot much is said on whom were enemies of these dwarves, but it seems\nlikely that the Easterlings were one of them since their empire was near\nand around the Iron Hills, and possibly the Dragons that lived nearby in\nthe northern wastes.",

The Dwarves of\nBelegost were friends to the Sindar and later allies of the Noldor of\nBeleriand. They first met the Noldor Elves near Mount Rerir and a great\nfriendship began between the two peoples; Maedhros once saved Lord\nAzaghâl from an Orc-assault. They joined the Union of Maedhros and\nfought bravely beside each other during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, where\nthey lost their ruler Lord Azaghâl in battle to the dragon Glaurung.\n\nWhen the Dwarves of Nogrod assembled a great host of Dwarves to attack\nDoriath, the Dwarves of Belegost tried to dissuade them from war, but\ntheir brethren from Nogrod did not heed their advice. These Dwarves went\non to fight in the Battle of the Thousand Caves, and later met their\ndemise the Battle of Sarn Athrad. After this tragedy the Dwarves of\nBelegost started leaving for Khazad-dûm, for fear of reprisal from the\nElves. There was much loathing between Elf and Dwarf from there on.\n\nBelegost was later ruined in the War of Wrath, and most of the dwarves\nleft for Khazad-dûm. Some stayed to build, or rebuild, new homes and\nmines, along with the remaining Dwarves of Nogrod.\n\nIn smithing, the Dwarves of Belegost were second only to the Dwarves of\nNogrod. They learned many secrets in smithing from the Elves, and Elves\nfrom them. They created many weapons for the Elves when evil began to\nstir in Beleriand, and the smiths of Belegost were the first to create\nlinked ring mail.\n"

Here he called the tale of _Beren and\n    Lúthien_ ‘the chief of the stories of _The Silmarillion_’, and of it\n    he said: ‘the story is (I think a beautiful and powerful)\n    heroic-fairy-romance, receivable in itself with only a very general\n    vague knowledge of the background. But it is also a fundamental link\n    in the cycle, deprived of its full significance out of its place\n    therein.’ ‘There are other stories almost equally full in\n    treatment,’ he went on, ‘and equally independent, and yet linked to\n    the general history’: these are _The Children of Húrin_ and _The\n    Fall of Gondolin_.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n    It thus seems unquestionable, from my father’s own words, that if he\n    could achieve final and finished narratives on the scale he desired,\n    he saw the three ‘Great Tales’ of the Elder Days (_Beren and\n    Lúthien_, the _Children of Húrin_, and the _Fall of Gondolin_) as\n    works sufficiently complete in themselves as not to demand knowledge\n    of the great body of legend known as _The Silmarillion_.\n\nChristopher also stated in the _The War of the Jewels_:\n\n    The completion of the _Quenta Silmarillion_ remained an aim; but the\n    'great tales', vastly developed from their original forms, from\n    which its later chapters should be derived were never achieved.\n\n\nOther Great Tales\n\nTolkien has used the term 'great tale' to refer to other works in his\nlegendarium as well.\n\nFor example in _Letters 131_ (quote mentioned above) which Tolkien\nrefers to all of the stories in the _Quenta Silmarillion_ as 'great\ntales', he also discusses _Lord of the Rings_ as being the last 'great\nTale':\n\n    But as the earliest Tales are seen through Elvish eyes, as it were,\n    this last great Tale, coming down from myth and legend to the earth,\n    is seen mainly though the eyes of Hobbits: it thus becomes in fact\n    anthropocentric.\n\nSam makes reference to this in _The Return of the King_ when he states\n(when comparing their own story to Beren and Lúthien's tale):\n\n    “Why, to think of it, we’re in the same tale still! It’s going on.\n    Don’t the great tales never end?”\n\nOne of the earliest references to the term 'great tale' is included in\nthe “The Cottage of Lost Play” in _The Book of Lost Tales_:\n\n    Now it happened on a certain time that a traveller from far\n    countries, a man of great curiosity, was by desire of strange lands\n    and the ways and dwellings of unaccustomed folk brought in a ship as\n    far west even as the Lonely Island, Tol Eressëa in the fairy speech,\n    but which the Gnomes1 call Dor Faidwen, the Land of Release, and a\n    great tale hangs thereto.\n\nThe _Book of Lost Tales_ makes several other references to 'great tales'\nas well\n\n    \n\nThe chapter _The Hiding of Valinor_ is also called a 'great tale':\n\n    And thus ended Vairë, and the great tale fell silent in the room.\n\nIn _The Tale of Tinúviel_ Beren uses flattery towards Melko (Morgoth) by\nstating:\n\n    Many a great tale has my father made to me aforetime of thy\n    splendour and glory, wherefore, albeit I am no renegade thrall, I do\n    desire nothing so much as to serve thee in what small manner I\n    may...\n\nOne of the earliest references to the Fall of Gondolin being a 'great\ntale':\n\n    Yet now those exiles of Gondolin dwelt at the mouth of Sirion by the\n    waves of the Great Sea. There they take the name of Lothlim, the\n    people of the flower, for Gondothlim is a name too sore to their\n    hearts; and fair among the Lothlim Eärendel grows in the house of\n    his father, and the great tale of Tuor is come to its waning.\n\nFinally, the references to the unwritten _Tale of Eärendel_ in the\nchapter _The Fall of Gondolin_ which includes _Tuor and the Exiles of\nGondolin (which bringeth in the great tale of Eärendel)_:\n\n    And thus did all the fates of the fairies weave then to one strand,\n    and that strand is the great tale of Eärendel; and to that tale’s\n    true beginning are we now come.\n"

During the First Age he was lord of the Falas, a\nshoreland region in which stood two great havens, Brithombar and\nEglarest. After the defeat of the Elves in the great battle of the\nNirnaeth Arnoediad, the forces of Morgoth broke down the walls of\nCírdan's Havens and laid them in ruin. Círdan himself escaped the\ndestruction aboard a ship, in which he sailed to the Isle of Balar and\ncreated a new haven and refuge far from Morgoth's ravaging armies.\n\nThus Círdan had been a lord of Havens back into the history of\nMiddle-earth, but the title 'Lord of the Havens' is only used after the\nbeginning of the Second Age, when he served High King Gil-galad as the\nMaster of the Grey Havens. These Grey Havens, or Mithlond in Elvish,\nwere founded on the new western coasts of Middle-earth in Lindon, after\nthe Sea had claimed most of the lands westward of the Blue Mountains.\nFrom there Círdan oversaw the making of the ships that would sail out\ninto the Great Sea and on to Aman in the Uttermost West.\n\nThe importance of Círdan as Lord of the Havens is shown by the fact that\nhe bore, for a time, one of the Three Rings of the Elves. When\nCelebrimbor sent two of the Rings north to Gil-galad for safekeeping,\nGil-galad passed one of them, Narya the Ring of Fire, to Círdan. Círdan\npassed it on in turn, for he was at the Grey Havens when the Wizards\nsailed into harbour. He chose to grant the Ring to one among them - the\none later named Mithrandir or Gandalf - as an aid in his work in\nMiddle-earth.\n\nThe Grey Havens had been founded at the very beginning of the Second\nAge, and still stood at the end of the Third. Círdan had been their Lord\nfor all this time; as he watched the White Ship carry the Ring-bearers\nout from his harbour, he had held the Lordship of the Havens for a\nperiod of nearly six and a half millennia. At some point in the Fourth\nAge, it seems, Círdan finally boarded the Last Ship to sail from\nMithlond, and passed from Middle-earth after thousands of years as Lord\nof the Havens."
