    "text": "AULË (Quenya; IPA: - “Invention”) was an Ainur, one of the Aratar and a\nValar, who was responsible for fashioning and crafting the substances of\nwhich Arda, the world, was composed. He was also called '''Mahal\n'''(Khuzdul; IPA: “Maker”), '''Oli '''(Sindarin; IPA: “Dream”) or\nNÁVATAR and delights in the nature of substances and in works of skill,\nbut not concerned with possession or mastery. Besides the shaping of\nArda, Aulë's greatest works were the Two Lamps of the Valar, the vessels\nof the Sun and Moon, and the Dwarves, whom he created out of impatience\nfor the Children of Ilúvatar. He also created Angainor (the chain of\nMelkor). Biography As Aulë was a smith, he was the Valar most similar in\nthought and powers to Melkor, in that they each gloried in the\nfashioning of artful and original things. Both also came to create\nbeings of their own. But while Aulë strove to be true to the original\nintent of the Music of the Ainurs, and submitted all that he did to the\nwill of Ilúvatar, Melkor wished to control and subvert all things, and\nwas jealous of the creations of others so that he would try to twist or\ndestroy all that they made. There was long strife between Aulë and\nMelkor both before and after the creation of Arda. Aulë, however,\ntraditionally opposed attempts to fight Melkor, for fear of the damage\nthat would be wrought to Arda. When the Elves came to Valinor, the\nÑoldor became the students of Aulë. Fëanor was his greatest pupil, and\nfrom him learned to make gems through craftsmanship that is now\nforgotten. This would eventually lead to the Silmarils, the greatest\ncreation of handiwork within Arda. On the Flight of the Noldor, the\nNoldor who returned to Valinor under Finarfin named themselves the\n_Aulendur_, Followers of Aulë. Despite his lordly skill, Aulë was humble\nand compassionate, and indeed the Dwarves survived only because Aulë\nsubmitted them to the will of Ilúvatar. His spouse was Yavanna, with\nwhom he dwelt in central Valinor. The Creation of the Dwarves Desperate\nfor pupils onto whom he could pass his knowledge, and unwilling to wait\nfor the emergence of the Children of Ilúvatar, Aulë created his own race\nof beings, the dwarves. However, he did not have a clear idea of what\nthe Children of Ilúvatar would be like, and because of the presence of\nthe chaos caused by Melkor, Aulë made the Dwarves strong and unyielding,\nand not willing to endure the domination of others, as well as embodying\nsome of his values and desires for Middle-earth. However Aulë did not\nhave the power to give independent life to his creations, they could act\nonly when his thought was on them. When Aulë completed his work he began\nto instruct the Dwarves in a language he had made for them, Khuzdul.\nThen Ilúvatar spoke to Aulë, asking why he would seek to exceed his\npower and authority by attempting to make new life. Aulë repented,\nanswering that the drive to create was kindled in him by Ilúvatar, and\nthat he only wished for other beings to love and teach, with whom to\nshare in the beauty of the world. He admitted that his impatience had\ndriven him to folly and submitted his creations to Ilúvatar. Assuming\nthat they should be destroyed, he made to smite the seven Fathers of the\nDwarves with a great hammer.  As he raised the hammer the Dwarves shrank\nfrom the coming blow, but Ilúvatar stayed Aulë's hand and showed that he\nhad accepted Aulë's offer by gifting the Dwarves with spirits of their\nown, else they could not have been afraid. Ilúvatar accepted the Dwarves\nas his adopted children however, as it was ordained that the elves were\nto be the first-born race, Ilúvatar set the Dwarves to sleep until after\nthe Awakening of the Elves. He told Aulë that while both were his\nchildren, their creation was outside the scope of the Music of the\nAinur, and strife would arise between the Dwarven race and the Elven\nrace as the events of the world unfolded. The Dwarves believe that after\nthey die their spirits move to halls that Aulë has set aside for them\nalone, and that their role will be to rebuild Arda after the Final\nBattle. Maiar of Aulë - Mairon (Sauron), the mightiest of the Maiar of\nAulë who used his knowledge of the metaphysical structure of Arda to\ngreat effect as a servant of Melkor in the First Age of Middle-earth and\nthen was his own master in the Second and Third Ages. When Sauron sought\nto corrupt the elves in the Second Age one of the names he assumed was\nAulendil, meaning devotee of Aulë.   - Curumo (Saruman), the leader of\nthe wizards sent to lead the people of Middle-earth against Sauron, only\nto betray his fellow wizards and ally with Sauron himself (who he also\nbetrayed in the end). It is interesting to note that two of the greatest\nMaiar sent to Middle-earth, that fell, were in the beginning both\naligned with Aulë. The reason for this is probably that this is the\norder most associated with craft, skill, and by these means, power.\nWeaker-willed spirits often fall prey to craving for power in Tolkien's\nworks, and these prove no exception. Also, Tolkien generally sees\nindustry as corruption. It seems Maiar of Aulë are the most powerful\nMaia because they are the closest to Ilúvatar's creation skills. Powers\nAulë seems to have a power most akin to Ilúvatar's - he can create an\ninnumerable amount of things. He made the Two Lamps, and made Angainor,\nMorgoth's chain. Although he does not have access to the Flame\nImperishable, he was able to create life (although it does not have free\nwill). As a Valar, he possesses incredible strength, and has been noted\nto have rebuilt Arda during and after Morgoth's period of destruction\nbefore the coming of the Elves. He likely forged the Valar's weaponry\nand armor for the War of Wrath. His strength is in the construction of\nnew things, and he is as near to the antithesis of the destructive\nMorgoth as one can be.﻿ Etymology _Aulë_ means ''invention ''in Quenya.\n_Mahal_ means ''maker ''in Khuzdul. _Oli_ means _dream_ in Sindarin.",

He was bred by Morgoth during the First Age, and was the\nlargest dragon to have ever existed in Middle-earth. Biography After\nEärendil made his journey to Valinor to convince the Valar to overthrow\nMorgoth and rescue the overmatched and defeated Elves and Edain, The\nHost of Valinor made war upon Morgoth and destroyed his armies. Facing\nfinal defeat, Morgoth unleashed his last and greatest weapon; a fleet of\nwinged fire drakes, led by Ancalagon. So terrible was their onslaught\nthat the armies of the Valar were driven back from the gates of Angband,\nand their coming was said to have been accompanied by a tempest of fire\nand lightning. But Eärendil came out of the West in his blessed ship\nVingilot, accompanied by the Eagles of Manwë led by Thorondor. The\nEagles and Eärendil dueled with Ancalagon and the other Dragons for an\nentire day. Eventually, Eärendil was victorious, casting Ancalagon down\nupon Thangorodrim and destroying the volcanic mountains in his fall. The\ndeath of Ancalagon marked the end of Morgoth's final resistance.

Other Names The Middle English translation\nfor _Ancalagon_ is ANDRACCA, from _and-_ (“opposition”), _anda_\n(“hatred, envy”), and _draca_ (“dragon”). Character Ancalagon's size is\nnot specified, but must have been colossal due to the destruction of\n“the towers of Thangorodrim”, which are elsewhere identified with the\nthree smoking peaks of the mountain. He was however, said to be as big\nas a mountain. However, his size is never directly specified and some\npowerful but small creatures are able to cause great destruction even in\ndeath, such as Durin's Bane breaking the slopes of Celebdil.

History Eldar Days and Second Age Originally, mortals were\nallowed to trade with those from Valinor in the Undying Lands, but were\nforbidden to sail west beyond the sight of Númenor. However, in SA 3319\n(Second Age), Sauron deceived Ar-Pharazôn, the King of Númenor, that the\nruler of the Undying Lands would be granted immortality. To prevent the\nking's invasion, Ilúvatar destroyed Númenor beneath the ocean and set\nthe Undying Lands forever beyond the reach of mortal Men.

    "text": "The FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING was formed as a brotherhood among members of\nthe various Free Peoples of Middle-earth. Its purpose was to take the\nOne Ring to Mordor that it might be cast into the fires of Mount Doom,\nthe mountain in which it was forged, so that it would be destroyed and\nultimately kill the Dark Lord Sauron. The '''Fellowship '''was also\nknown as the COMPANY OF THE RING, the NINE WALKERS, or more simply the\nCOMPANY. Each of the members of the Company were representatives of\ntheir respective races, with Legolas and Gimli being the only Elf and\nDwarf chosen. History Formation Formed after the Council of Elrond, the\nFellowship consisted of nine members: four Hobbits, two Men, one Elf,\none Dwarf, and one Wizard. It is the only known organisation/group ever\nformed in the history of Middle-earth, to hold members of each of these\nraces within it (and with the departure of the Elves and the Wizards\nfrom Middle-earth, there would never be another like it), who largely\nlived and acted independently of one another (or in the case of Elves\nand Dwarves, felt active animosity toward each other). This number was\nchosen to match the number of Ring Wraiths, also known as Black Riders,\nthe Nazgúl or the Nine Riders. Merry and Pippin were never intended to\nbe a part of the Fellowship, with Elrond considering two Elf-lords from\nhis own house. He wished to send the two younger hobbits back to the\nShire as messengers to warn other Hobbits of the growing evil. However,\nthe Halflings persevere: Merry is chosen and Gandalf convinces Elrond of\nthe loyalty of Pippin. The Fellowship of the Ring was formed by Elrond\nafter the Council of Elrond. The Fellowship, being led mainly by\nGandalf, headed down the path to Mordor. After a long and difficult\njourney south from Rivendell, and a near-catastrophic attempt to cross\nover the Misty Mountains, the Fellowship descended into Moria. In the\nformer Dwarf-kingdom, they found evidence that Orcs had slain Gimli's\nkinsman Balin and other Dwarves who had returned there. They were soon\nconfronted by the Balrog known as _Durin's Bane_, who had many Orc and\nTroll minions under his control. Gandalf fell facing this menace, and\nthe Company was forced to go on without him. Once they escaped Moria,\nthe Fellowship headed to the Elven forest of Lothlórien where they spoke\nwith the Elven Lord Celeborn and Galadriel, Lady of Light. Galadriel\nsupplied them each with special Elven Gifts from Lothlórien, boats and\nsupplies so that they could travel down the river Anduin. This route was\nquicker than an overland march, but the group was attacked by Orc\narchers and shadowed by Gollum, who had begun following them in Moria.\nForced to portage their boats around the waterfall called Rauros, the\nFellowship soon ran into difficulties. Boromir finally succumbed to\ntemptation, and attempted to seize the Ring from Frodo. This led to\nFrodo using the Ring to escape and he and Sam leaving to spare the\nothers the lure of it. The repentant Boromir died trying to defend Merry\nand Pippin against a large force of Uruks from Isengard. The Fellowship\nwas dissolved on the banks of the Anduin that day. Frodo and Sam carried\non towards Mordor; Boromir was given funerary rites and sent floating\nover the falls, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli departed on their way to\nsave Merry and Pippin. Breaking of the Fellowship After Boromir died the\nFellowship split into three paths. From there Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli\nchased after the Uruk-hai who took Merry and Pippin. Their plan was to\ntake the hobbits to Saruman in Isengard. Along the way the trio crossed\nthrough the Gap of Rohan and came across Éomer who led the banished\nRiders of Rohan across the land. After questioning Éomer, they found out\nthat the riders had already slain the Uruk-hai they were meant to track,\nthe night before in a bloody massacre. So upon arriving to site of\nbattle, Aragorn discovers that the hobbits fled deep into Fangorn\nForest. Gandalf, though thought to be dead when he fell at the Bridge of\nKhazad Dum in Moria, came back to Middle-earth, reincarnated as Gandalf\nthe White. He encountered Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in Fangorn, and\nthey, mistaking Gandalf for Saruman, attempted to kill him. Gandalf\nassured them that Merry and Pippin were safe (knowing they were in the\nhands of Treebeard). From there they rode out to Edoras, capital of\nRohan. It was there they saw King Theoden in ill-condition, poisoned by\nSaruman's servant Grima Wormtongue. Frodo and Sam continued their\njourney, getting closer to Mordor. Gollum had tailed them. While\nattempting to take “the precious” in their sleep, Frodo and Sam awoke\nand captured him. Frodo realizing who he was decided Gollum could be\nused as guide into Mordor. The Second Fellowship In the book, Aragorn\ncontinues to call the company he leads (Legolas and Gimli, occasionally\njoined by Gandalf, Merry, and Pippin) the Fellowship of the Ring even\nafter the original Fellowship breaks up following Boromir's death. The\nfellowship is reunited again after the War of The Ring up until Rohan,\nwhere the fellowship ends.

Statistics These trolls were very large, dwarfing\nall the others seen previously, (about 25 feet tall or more) more\nimportantly they were either fully or partially armored, unlike the\nsmaller yet extremely similar Guldur Olog-Hai, which were fully armored\nbut as stated above much smaller (about the size of a regular troll in\nthe films) These trolls were fearsome weapons on the field and\ndevastated dozens of soldiers with one strike alone of their weapons.\nThese trolls were quite intelligent and kept formation with the orcs as\nthey marched to battle, in battle these trolls carried bladed axe/sword\nlike weapons upon their arms, (similar to the Guldur Orcs's shields)\nlong metal maces which could smash the very earth several feet into the\nair, taking down several men at once. Some even used their bare hands,\nballing them up into fists to smash the allied armies, or sweeping them\nup and throwing them like rag-dolls. The less fortunate of these trolls\nwere also hideously amputated by the orcs, giving them morning star\n(wrecking ball-like) arms in place of their flesh and blood ones, some\nhad metal hooks placed into their backs for goblins to take hold of, and\nthe most unfortunate was blinded and given reigns dangling from their\neye sockets for orcs to directly take control of. These trolls were\nprobably Mountain Trolls from Gundabad in the northern misty mountains,\nthis would explain their height, and color of their skin (being a peach\nlike hue) instead of the darker blue cave troll skin or dark grey\nolog-hai skin. Unlike the smaller Guldur Olog's these trolls couldn't\nsimply be taken down by a spear throw to the neck or a few arrows. It\nwould take dozens of arrows and several spears/pikes to be sent into the\nunarmored parts of the trolls in order to take them down. A premeditated\nattack upon a troll would usually work and need to be planned out well\nin order to take out the beast before it took down a whole garrison.\nHistory These trolls were used primarily in Azog the Defiler's\nDol-Guldur orc army, directed to come out as soon as Azog called for the\nwar beasts, almost immediately these trolls smashed into the allied\narmy, causing massive damage, when some of the orc regiments made their\nway to the ruins of dale, some of these trolls joined them, climbing\nover the walls or simply smashing them down to gain access. One of these\ntrolls was even given a stone headpiece to act as a battering ram to the\nwalls of dale. Most of these trolls survived until the end of the\nbattle, still fighting on when the bats of gundabad arrived. But once\nthe Eagles arrived, the remaining trolls either fled into the Were -Worm\ntunnels, or were eventually taken down by the combined allied forces."

By the close of the Second\nAge Númenóreans had become split between the Elendili and the King's Men\n— a faction centered around the King that sought to assert Númenórean\nauthority and self-determination. With Númenor reaching the apex of its\nmight, the King's Men eventually espoused open defiance of the Valar.\nThis split would eventually precipitate the Fall of Númenor.

But the King's Men became more powerful, and by the end of\nthe Second Age had begun to persecute the Elendili as rebels and\ndissidents.

The Ñoldor, on the other hand, particularly the\nSons of Fëanor, had come with the express purpose of defeating Morgoth.\nChief Battles of this Age - The Dagor-nuin-Giliath, so named because it\nwas fought before the rising of the Sun) was fought soon after the\narrival of the Ñoldor. Morgoth sent a raiding party from Angband to\nattack the Ñoldor encampment in Hithlum, but the elves drove it back.\nFëanor was killed. It is considered the second battle in the Wars of\nBeleriand, after one that took place during the Years of the Trees. -\nThe Dagor Aglareb was fought about seventy-five years after the return\nof the Ñoldor. Morgoth again attacked the Ñoldor, and (again) with no\nsuccess. The Ñoldor became so bold as to besiege Angband. However, the\nSiege was of limited effectiveness, because the northern side of Angband\non the north side of the Ered Engrin, and was unapproachable to the\nElven forces.   - The Dagor Bragollach began when Morgoth poured rivers\nof fire out of Angband, ruining the besieging Ñoldorin armies. The\nÑoldor eventually mustered a defense, but their losses were severe. For\ninstance, the green plain of Ard-galen had been permanently laid waste\nby the rivers of fire, and was now called _Anfauglith_, the Choking\nDust; and the highlands of Dorthonion, which had been inhabited by\nEdain, were made inhospitable.   - The Nirnaeth Arnoediad was the first\nbattle to be started by the Ñoldor for the purpose of ending the power\nof Morgoth. They massed an army composed of Elves, Edain, and the\nEasterling houses of Bór and Ulfang allied to the Sons of Fëanor. The\nElves and their allies came very close to Angband, but Morgoth's\ntrickery had upset their battle plan, and Ulfang proved to be\ntreacherous. The name “Unnumbered Tears” comes from the fact that the\nElves' last hope of victory was destroyed. The land of Hithlum was lost,\nthe Sons of Fëanor were largely scattered, and the free peoples of\nBeleriand had been decimated. The forces of Morgoth made a heap of the\nElven and Mannish dead in the center of Anfauglith.   - The War of Wrath\ntook place after Eärendil sailed to Valinor and persuaded the Valar to\nhelp those whom they had forsaken. The Valar gathered an army comprised\nof Maiar, Vanyar, and those Ñoldor who had stayed in Valinor. The Teleri\nrefused their aid, due to the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, but consented to\nferry the armies of the Valar in their famous ships. This battle marked\nthe first appearance of the winged dragons, most notably Ancalagon the\nBlack, but the Valar had the day. Morgoth was captured, and cast out of\nArda, but his lands, as well as most of Beleriand, had been destroyed\nand sunk under the sea in the heat of battle."

    "text": "ARNOR, also known as the NORTHERN KINGDOM, was a kingdom of men located\nin the land of Eriador in Middle-earth. The name probably means “Land of\nthe King”, from Sindarin ARA- (high, kingly) + (N)DOR (land). History\nArnor was founded in SA 3320 by Elendil and sons who went on to found\nthe southern realm of Gondor. The history of the two kingdoms is\nintertwined; both kingdoms are known as the Realms of the Dúnedain in\nExile. Before the foundation of Arnor there was already a sizable\nNúmenórean population living there, a result of the slow emigration of\nNúmenóreans which had started under Tar-Meneldur and Tar-Aldarion.\nBefore the arrival of the Dúnedain, Arnor was home to Middle Men of\nEdain stock, and the early colonists soon interbred with the indigenous\npopulation. Arnor was originally favoured over the more southern regions\n(Gondor) because the Elves under Gil-galad lived near it across the\nriver Lhûn. However, in later days after the Númenóreans fell under\nSauron's shadow they settled more to the south. This led to a situation\nwhere Elendil arrived in an area populated by people who, unlike his own\nNúmenóreans, were mainly still friends with the Elves, and unlike Gondor\nto the south in Arnor much knowledge of the Elder Days was preserved.\nArnor's second king Isildur (also King of Gondor) was killed in TA 2 by\norcs in the disastrous Battle of the Gladden Fields. His three eldest\nsons were killed with him, but the fourth and youngest, Valandil,\nsurvived and became king of Arnor (TA 2 or 10?). Because Valandil and\nhis heirs did not claim the throne of Gondor the realms were split, but\nArnor's ruler kept the title High King, whereas in the south the ruler\nwas just _King._ At its height, Arnor borders extended from the Ice-Bay\nof Forochel in the north, the river Greyflood down to Belegaer in the\nsouth, the river Hoarwell in the east, and the river Lune in the west.\nThe capital city was Annúminas, and the realm included other cities such\nas Fornost, Tharbad, Lond Daer, and Tyrn Gorthad. Decline Human folly\nand the plots of a deathless evil had undone this dream. Arnor was no\nmore; divided into the three kingdoms of Arthedain, Cardolan and\nRhudaur, the Dúnedain of the North spent their strength in foolish,\npetty wars and while corruption and ambition sapped their strength,\nenemies gathered on their frontiers. Arnor's capital was Annúminas on\nLake Evendim, but by TA 861 Fornost Erain had become the capital instead\nas Annúminas became depopulated. After the death of its tenth king,\nEärendur, in 861, Arnor was shaken by civil war between the three sons\nof Eärendur. The eldest son, Amlaith, claimed Kingship over all Arnor\nbut was reduced to only ruling the region of Arthedain as his kingdom,\nwhile the other sons founded the kingdoms of Cardolan and Rhudaur. Arnor\nwas refounded in name by Arthedain's king Argeleb I, when Cardolan\nplaced itself under the suzerainty of Arthedain. However, even Arthedain\nwas eventually destroyed. The people of Arnor were mostly wiped out by\nthe wars, but the Hobbits survived in the Shire, men survived in Bree\nand probably other villages, and the Dúnedain of Arnor created new homes\nin the Angle south of Rivendell, where some of them became known as the\nRangers of the North. Reunited Kingdom Aragorn II as King Elessar\nrefounded the Kingdom of Arnor as part of the Reunited Kingdom, and made\nAnnúminas his summer capital. After the fall of Sauron, Arnor was safe\nagain for human population, and although it remained less populated than\nGondor to the south, in time Arnor became a more densely populated area\nagain, even when it had dwindled in size due to the independence of the\nShire.",

    "title": "Sindarin",
    "page_id": "160",
    "text": "SINDARIN was the Elvish language most commonly spoken in Middle-earth\nduring in the Third Age - in the real world it is universally referred\nto as, when not in canonical context, “ELVEN” or “ELVISH”. The written\nalphabet of Sindarin, as with Quenya, is typically Tengwar (the\nFeanorian Characters), although Cirth (Runes) can also be used. History\nIt was the language of the Sindar, those Teleri who chose to stay behind\non the Great Journey of the Elves. It was derived from an earlier\nlanguage called “Common Telerin”. When the Ñoldor came back to\nMiddle-earth, they adopted the Sindarin language, for the Sindar were\nmore numerous and slower to learn the language of Valinor, Quenya the\nNoldor's native language. Later events led to the banning of the use of\nQuenya within and around Beleriand leading to it's eventual use as a\nhigh language of law. Before the downfall, most of the Men of Númenor\nalso spoke the language. Knowledge of it was kept in the Númenorean\nrealm in exile Gondor, especially among the learned. Dwarves, notably\nDurin's Folk, used Sindarin when communicating with Elves. Sindarin is\nthe language referred to as _the Elven-tongue_ in _The Lord of the\nRings_. Tolkien originally imagined that the language which would become\n_Sindarin_ was spoken by the Ñoldor (second clan of Elves). However he\nlater decided that it was the language of the Sindar. For this reason it\nis called _Noldorin_ in the older material, such as the Etymologies.\nWhen Noldorin became Sindarin, it also adopted some features of the\noriginally unrelated language _Ilkorin_. Tolkien based the sound and\nsome of the grammar of his Noldorin/Sindarin on Welsh, and Sindarin\ndisplays of the consonant mutations that characterise the Celtic\n(especially Brythonic) languages. The language was also probably\ninfluenced to an extent by the Germanic languages, as Tolkien was a\nscholar of both Old English and Old Norse. Grammar Sindarin is mainly\nanalytic, though traits of its highly inflected progenitor can still be\nseen. Phonology Sindarin was designed to have a Welsh-like phonology. It\nhas most of the same sounds and similar phonotactics. -------- -----\n------------------------------------------------------------- LETTER IPA\nNOTES a b c ch The “ch” in the German word “Buch”, not as in “church” d\ndh The “th” in “heather” e f Represents when final or before n,\neverywhere else. g h hw i Represents when initial, everywhere else. l lh\nɬ The same as the Welsh LL. m n ng Represents when final, everywhere\nelse. o p ph Represents when final, everywhere else. r rh s t th The\n“th” in “heath” u v w y Pronounced like German _ü_ -------- -----\n------------------------------------------------------------- An accent\nsignifies a long vowel (á, é, etc.). In a monosyllabic word, a\ncircumflex is used (â, ê, etc.). However, for practical reasons, users\nof the ISO Latin-1 character set often substitute ý for ŷ. Diphthongs\nare _ai_ (pronounced like AIsle), _ei_ (dAY), _ui_ (tOO Young), _au_\n(cOW), and _oi_ (bOY). If the last diphthong finishes a word, it is\nspelt _aw_. There are also diphthongs _ae_ and _oe_ with no English\ncounterparts; Tolkien recommended to substitute _ai_ and _oi_\nrespectively if one does not care about details. If one does care, it is\nsimilar to pronouncing _a_ or _o_ respectively in the same syllable as\none pronounces an _e_ (as in pEt). In archaic Sindarin, there was a\nvowel similar to German _ö_ (IPA: ), which Tolkien mostly transcribed as\n_œ_ (usually _not_ as _oe_ as is often found in publications like the\nSilmarillion, cf. _Nirnaeth Arnoediad_ , _Goelydh_ ). This vowel later\ncame to be pronounced and is therefore transcribed as such . Archaic\nSindarin also had a spirant _m_ or nasal _v_ (IPA: ), which was\ntranscribed as _mh_ (though always pronounced in later Sindarin). Nouns\nPluralization Sindarin plurals are characterised by _i-affection_, or\n_umlaut_. The Sindarin term for this is _prestanneth_ (disturbance,\naffection). Almost all Sindarin words form their plurals like English\nman/men and goose/geese — by changing the vowels in the word. The plural\npatterns are: - In non-final syllables: - a > e — galadh > gelaidh - e >\ne — bereth > berith - i > i — dineth > dinith - o > e — gowest > gewist\n- u > y — tulus > tylys - y > y — (no example available) - In final\nsyllables: - a > ai — anar > enair - â > ai — tâl > tail - e > i —\nadaneth > edenith - ê > î — hên > hîn - i > i — brennil > brennil - î >\nî — dîs > dîs - o > y — brannon > brennyn - ó > ý — bór > býr - ô > ý —\nthôn > thýn - u > y — urug > yryg - û > ui — hû > hui - y > y — ylf >\nylf - ý > ý — mýl > mýl - au > oe — naug > noeg Note that _ai_ can\nsometimes become _î_ (or, less commonly, _ý_). The reason for this is\nthat the primitive plural ending _-î_ (still present in Quenya as _-i_)\naffected the vowels in the word by making them higher and fronter. After\nthis sound change occurred, the suffix _-î_ disappeared when all final\nvowels were lost. Class Plural Sindarin also has several suffixes which\ndenote a so-called class plural. For example, _-ath_ indicates a group\nof something, e. g. _elenath_ from elen (an archaic form of _êl_),\nmeaning _star_ and _-ath_. It means _a group of stars_ or _all the stars\nin the sky_. Another ending, _-rim_, is used to indicate a race, e. g.\n_nogothrim_ from _nogoth_ — _dwarf_ and _-rim_, meaning _the race of\ndwarves_. The ending _-hoth_ is generally used in an unfriendly sense,\ne. g. _gaurhoth_ from _gaur_ — _werewolf_ and _-hoth_, meaning\n_werewolf-host_. Mutation Sindarin has a complex series of mutations.\nThere are three main different types of mutations: _soft mutation_ (or\nlenition), _nasal mutation_ and _stop_ (occlusive) _mutation_.\nAdditionally, a _mixed mutation_ is also observed after certain\nparticles or prepositions. Finally, it is presumed that Sindarin also\nonce had what we could call an _archaic spirantal mutation_ (also\nsometimes called _liquid mutation_ by scholars). It is still uncertain\nwhether this mutation is still productive or if it only occurs in\nancient constructs. Initial mutations must not be confused with\nassimilations that may occur in compound words (such as, for instance,\nin the names _Araphor_, _Arassuil_ and _Caradhras_). The following table\noutlines how different consonants are affected by the different\nmutations. ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ -------- BASIC SOFT\nNASAL MIXED STOP LIQUID b v m b b v c g ch g ch ch d dh n d d dh g ' ng\ng g ' h ch ch h ch ch lh thl 'l 'l thl 'l m v m m m v p b ph b b ph rh\nthr 'r 'r thr 'r s s s h s s t d th d th th ------- ------ -------\n------- ------ -------- Here the apostrophe indicates elision. Words\nbeginning in _b-_, _d-_, or _g-_ which descend from older _mb-_, _nd-_,\nor _ng-_ are affected differently by the mutations: ------- ------\n------- ------- ------ -------- BASIC SOFT NASAL MIXED STOP LIQUID b m\nmb mb mb b d n nd nd nd d g ng g g g g ------- ------ ------- -------\n------ -------- Take, for example, the deictic article _i_, which\ntriggers soft mutation. When added to a word like _tâl_, it becomes _i\ndâl_. In Sindarin's phonological history, _t_ became _d_ in the middle\nof a word. Because _i tâl_ at the time was considered one word, the _t_\nbecame _d_, and thus _i dâl_. However, without the article the word is\nstill _tâl_. Mutation is triggered in various ways: - Soft mutation, the\nmost widely occurring mutation, is triggered by the singular article\n_i_, the prefixes _athra-, ath-, go-, gwa-, ú-,_ and _u-_, as well as\nthe prepositions _ab, am, adel, be, dad, di, na, nu,_ and _î_, and after\n_avo_. It also affects the second element in a compound, an adjective\nfollowing a noun, and the object of a verb.   - Nasal mutation is\ntriggered by the plural article _in_, and the prepositions _an, dan,_\nand plural _'nin_.   - Mixed mutation is triggered by the genitive\narticle _en_, and the prepositions _ben, erin, nan, 'nin,_ and _uin_.  \n- Stop mutation is triggered by the prepositions _ed, ned,_ and _o(d)_.\n  - Liquid mutation is presumably triggered by the preposition _or_.\nPronouns Pronouns are perhaps the most poorly attested feature of\nSindarin. What has been reconstructed by the comparative method is\nlargely conjectural and is not agreed upon, and therefore will not be\naddressed in this article. Sindarin pronouns, like those in English,\nstill maintain some case distinction. Sindarin pronouns have nominative,\naccusative, genitive, and dative forms.   First Person Second Person\nThird Person   Singular Plural Singular Plural Singular Plural\nNominative im me le, ci le, ci e, te ti Accusative nin men len, cin len,\ncin ten, den tin, hain Genitive   mín   lín dîn   Dative anim, enni\nammen         Enclitic -n -m -ch   — -r Verbs Sindarin verbs are also\nquite complex. The number of attested verbs in Sindarin is small, so the\nSindarin verb system is imperfectly known; no verb has a full paradigm\nof forms available. There are two main types of verbs: _basic_ and\n_derived_. Basic verbs have stems which end in a consonant, and derived\nverbs have stems which incorporate some sort derivational morpheme (such\nas a causative ending) which ends in _-a_. Basic Verbs Basic verbs,\nthough smaller in number than derived verbs, have a very complex\nconjugation which arises from Sindarin's phonological history. Basic\nverbs form the infinitve by adding _-i_: _giri_ from _gir-_. This ending\ncauses an _a_ or _o_ in the stem to umlaut to _e_: _blebi_ from _blab-_.\nSindarin does not use infinitive forms very often, and rather uses the\ngerund to achieve the same meaning. For all persons except the third\nperson singular, the present tense is formed by the insertion of _-i_,\nand the proper enclitic pronomial ending: _girin_, _girim_, _girir_. As\nwith the infinitive, _-i_ causes an _a_ or _o_ in the stem to umlaut to\n_e_: _pedin_, _pedim_, _pedir_, from _pad-_. The third person singular,\nbecause it has a zero-ending, does not require the insertion of _-i_.\nThis leaves the bare stem, which, because of Sindarin's phonological\nhistory, causes the vowel of the stem to become long: _gîr_, _blâb_,\n_pâd_. The past tense of basic verbs is very complicated and poorly\nattested. One common reconstructed system is to use _-n_: _darn_.\nHowever, the only time this _-n_ actually remains is after a stem in\n_-r_. After a stem ending in _-l_, _-n_ becomes _-ll_: _toll_. After\n_-b, -d, -g, -v,_ or _-dh_, it is metathesized and then assimilated to\nthe same place of articulation as the consonant it now follows. The\nconsonant then experiences what could be called a “backwards mutation”:\n_-b, -d,_ and _-g_ become _-p, -b,_ and _-c_, and _-v_ and _-dh_ become\n_-m_ and _-d_. The matter is complicated even further when pronomial\nendings are added. Because _-mp, -mb, -nt, -nd,_ and _-nc_ did not\nsurvive medially, they become _-mm-, -mm-, -nn-, -nn-,_ and _-ng_. In\naddition, past tense stems in _-m_ would have _-mm-_ before any\npronomial endings. Because this all may seem rather overwhelming, look\nat these examples which show step-by-step transformations: - _cab-_ >\n**_cabn_ > **_canb_ > **_camb_ > _camp_, becoming _camm-_ with any\npronomial endings. - _ped-_ > **_pedn_ > **_pend_ > _pent_, becoming\n_penn-_ with any pronomial endings. - _dag-_ > **_dagn_ > **_dang_ (_n_\npronounced as in _men_) > **_dang_ (_n_ pronounced as in _sing_) >\n_danc_, becoming _dang-_ with any pronomial endings. - _lav-_ > **_lavn_\n> **_lanv_ > **_lanm_ > **_lamm_ > _lam_, becoming _lamm-_ before any\npronomial endings. - _redh-_ > **_redhn_ > **_rendh_ > **_rend_ >\n_rend_, becoming _renn-_ before any pronomial endings. The future tense\nis formed by the addition of _-tha_. An _-i_ is also inserted between\nthe stem and _-tha_, which again causes _a_ and _o_ to umlaut to _e_.\nEndings for all persons except for the first person singular can be\nadded without any further modification: _giritham_, _blebithar_. The\nfirst person singular ending _-n_ causes the _-a_ in _-tha_ to become\n_-o_: _girithon_, _blebithon_, _pedithon_. The imperative is formed with\nthe addition of _-o_ to the stem: _giro!_, _pado!_, _blabo!_. Derived\nVerbs Derived verbs have a much less complex conjugation because they\nhave a thematic vowel (usually _a_) which reduces the number of\nconsonant combinations which occur. The infinitive is formed with -o,\nwhich replaces the -a of the stem, e. g. _lacho_ from _lacha-_. The\npresent tense is formed without modification to the stem. Pronomial\nendings are added without any change. The past tense is formed with the\nending _-nt_, which becomes _-nne_ with any pronomial endings, e. g.\n_erthant_, _erthanner_. The future tense is formed with _-tha_. With the\naddition of the first person singular _-n_, this becomes _-tho_. The\nimperative is formed like the infinitive. Dialects During the First Age\nthere were several dialects of Sindarin: - _Doriathrin_ or the language\nof Doriath, a form of the language which preserved many archaic forms; -\n_Falathrin_ or the language of the Falas, later also spoken in\nNargothrond; - _North Sindarin_, the dialects originally spoken in\nDorthonion and Hithlum by the Sindar, these dialects contained many\nunique words and were not fully intelligible with the Sindarin of\nBeleriand proper. With the exception of Doriathrin, the dialects were\nchanged under Ñoldorin influence, and adopted many Quenya features, as\nwell as unique sound changes devised by the Ñoldor (who loved changing\nlanguages). The distinct dialects disappeared after the Ñoldor and\nSindar were dispersed during the later Battles of Beleriand. In the\nrefuges on the Isle of Balar and the Mouths of Sirion a new dialect\narose under the refugees, which mainly took after Falathrin. During the\nSecond Age and Third Age Sindarin was a lingua franca for all Elves and\ntheir friends, until it was displaced as the Common tongue by Westron, a\ndescendant of Adûnaic which was heavily influenced by Sindarin.\n_Sindarin_ is actually a Quenya term. The Sindarin word was perhaps\nEDHELLEN (“Elvish”). Sample Phrases In _The Lord of the Rings_ - _Ai na\nvedui Dúnadan! Mae govannen!_ - Ah, at last, Westman! Well met! - _Noro\nlim._ - Run fast. - _Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen! Fennas nogothrim,\nlasto beth lammen!_ - Elvish gate open now for us; doorway of the\nDwarf-folk listen to the word of my tongue! - _Mellon nîn!_ - My friend!\n- _Ennyn Durin Aran Moria: pedo mellon a minno.

    "text": "The FOURTH AGE was the time period that followed the War of the Ring. It\nwas an age of peace, and was also known as the “Age of Men”. History The\nFourth Age began after Sauron was vanquished and the One Ring was\ndestroyed. The Shire and the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor were restored.\nIt marked the ascent of Men and the final diminishing of the Elves.\nGandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Bilbo and Frodo sailed for the Undying\nLands. The allies of Sauron suffered a devastating blow that would take\nthem centuries to recover, if they did at all. Harad was defeated and\nconcluded a peace with King Aragorn II Elessar, by which Umbar, whose\nfleet had been completely destroyed in the mouths of the Anduin, was\nreturned to Gondor, and South Gondor also annexed. The Easterlings also\nsuffered a terrible defeat as their Orc allies fled in terror from the\nBattle of the Black Gate. However, King Elessar, his descendants and\nallies such as King Éomer still on occasion warred with their enemies\nover land, particularly over the bitterly contested region of the Sea of\nRhûn. King Elessar died in FO 120 and was succeeded by his son Eldarion\nwho ruled until about FO 220. Of the kings of the Reunited Kingdom after\nhim, nothing is known. Tolkien said that he thought the distance between\nthe end of the Third Age and the 20th century A.D. was about 6000 years,\nand that 1958 should have been around the end of the Fifth Age if the\nFourth and Fifth Ages were about the same length as the Second and Third\nAges. He said, however, in a letter written in 1958 that he believed the\nAges had quickened and that it was about the end of the Sixth Age or\nbeginning of the Seventh (this letter is referred to in the “Fourth Age”\narticle of _The Encyclopedia of Arda,_ as mentioned below)."

    "text": "VALINOR (Quenya; IPA: ; also VALINÓRË; ; meaning _Land of the Valar_),\nthe Land_' across the Sea_', was the realm of the Valar in Aman; the\nplace to which they migrated after being driven from Almaren by Melkor\nin times before the First Age. It was also known as the Undying Lands as\nonly immortal souls were allowed to reside there, with some exceptions\nwhen it came to the bearers of the One Ring; and additionally, even\nGimli, who accompanied his friend Legolas to these lands. Lay of the\nland Its major city was Valmar, where the Vanyar and the Valar resided.\nTwo other cities were Alqualondë and Tirion, the respective homes of the\nTeleri and the Noldor. It also had an island, Tol Eressëa, just off its\neast coast. Valinor as explained was the home of the Valar, the Powers\nof Middle-earth. The sea to the west of the island was called Ekkaia, or\nthe Encircling Sea; it surrounded both Valinor and Middle-earth. Each of\nthe Valar had their own region of the land where they resided and\naltered things to their desire. Yavanna, the Vala of nature, growth, and\nharvest, resided in the Pastures of Yavanna in the south of the island.\nOrome, the Vala of the hunt, lived in the Woods of Orome to the\nnorth-east of the pastures. The forest was home to many creatures which\nOrome could track and hunt. Nienna, the lonely Vala of sorrow and\nendurance lived cut off in the far west of the island in the Halls of\nNienna where she spent her days crying, looking out to sea. Just south\nof the Halls of Nienna and to the north of the pastures there were the\nHalls of Mandos. Mandos, the brother of Nienna, was the Vala of the\nafterlife. All inhabitants of Middle-earth went to the Halls of Mandos\nshould they happen to die, mortals and immortals alike (immortals could\nbe killed although they did not die of old age) although it was said\nthat in death as in life, they were separated. Also living in the Halls\nof Mandos was his spouse Vairë the weaver, who wove the threads of time.\nTo the east of the Halls of Mandos was the Isle of Estë, which was\nsituated in the middle of the lake of Lorellin which in turn was\nsituated to the north of the Gardens of Lórien (not to be confused with\nLothlórien in Middle-earth which was created by the same Valar, Lórien\nalso known as Irmo, the Vala of dreams). Este and Lórien being husband\nand wife lived close together. To the north of this were the Mansions of\nAule the smith Valar who was spouse to Yavanna. In the north-east lay\nthe Mansions of Manwe and Varda, the two most powerful Valar, also\nmarried. To the west of them stood the Trees of Valinor, Telperion and\nLaurelin. The entire great island of Valinor was surrounded on three\nsides (excluding the north which was instead protected by ices flows) by\na huge mountain range called the Pelóri mountains. In the extreme\nnorth-east, past the mountain range was the pass of Helcaraxë, a vast\nand treacherous ice sheet which in the beginning, before the fall of\nNúmenor, joined the two continents of Valinor and Middle-earth. In the\nbeginning, the Noldor, tricked by the evil Vala Melkor passed along this\npass to go back to Middle-earth, among those was Galadriel who was\nfeatured in the War of the Ring. Those who took this pass were not\nallowed back to Valinor for many years, but in the end pity was taken on\nthem when Middle-earth began to fade and pass into the age of men and\nthey were allowed to pass back to the Undying Lands of their own accord\nwhen they felt ready to do so. Also, for a time after the exile of the\nNoldor and before the ruin of Númenor, a long chain of small islands\ncalled the Enchanted Isles ran the full length of the east coast to the\ncontinent. The enchanted islands and a bewildering shadow created the\nShadowy Seas, which to prevent mariner, mortal or immortal, from\nreaching the land by sea (by the Belegaer, the Great Sea which separated\nMiddle-earth and Valinor. Until the Changing of the World in the center\nof this sea was the isle of Númenor. This defence lasted centuries until\nEärendil was guided through the Shadowy Seas by the light of the\nSilmaril brought on board by his wife Elwing. They sailed on Vingilot,\nsaid to be the fairest ship ever fashioned, constructed by Earendil and\nCirdan the shipwright. After the destruction of Númenor and the Changing\nof the World, the Undying Lands were no longer a physical part of Arda\nso that Men could no longer sail to Aman or Tol Eressea. Only the Elves\ncould sail there by the Straight Road and in ships capable of passing\nout of the Spheres of the earth. By special permission of the Valar, the\nHobbits Frodo Baggins, Bilbo Baggins, and Samwise Gamgee were also\npermitted to go to Valinor, and Legolas the elf brought with him Gimli\nthe Dwarf."

    "text": "ERIADOR was a large region situated in northwestern Middle-earth. It was\nlocated between the Blue Mountains (to the west) and the Misty Mountains\n(to the east). Description and Climate According to _The Atlas of\nMiddle-earth_, Eriador was about six-hundred miles (approximately 965.5\nkilometers) from east to west. It was mostly lowlands. Hill areas were\nmainly in around the realms of Arnor, the Shire in the center of the\nregion and in the far eastern parts near the Misty Mountains. Plains and\nbottomlands were in the south and southwestern parts. A plateau area\nexisted in the area where Rivendell and the Trollshaws were located.\nEriador was largely made up of scattered woodlands with scrublands in\nthe north and northeastern parts. The rest were short grasslands mainly\nin the center of the region. The climate was mainly humid with\nrelatively mild to cold winters with a constantly warm and moist\nprevailing wind blowing over the Blue Mountains. In the northern part,\ncold and dry prevailing winds blow down from the polar north influencing\nthe climate as well. Most of the population was concentrated in the\ncenter area around Arnor and the Shire and the dominant language was\nWestron at least by the Third Age. Its boundaries were: - To the east,\nthe Misty Mountains. - To the north, the Ice-Bay of Forochel, which\nflooded part of the lands of Morgoth after the War of Wrath. - To the\nwest, the Blue Mountains. - To the south, the river Greyflood and the\nland of Enedwaith. After the War of Wrath, part of the southwestern\nborder lies along the shores of Belegaer. Important rivers were the Lune\n(Elvish _Lhûn_), the Brandywine or _Baranduin_ in Elvish and the\nGreyflood. History In the Second Age, and possibly much earlier, it was\nlargely forested, but Men cleared the land for farming and the massive\nold forests never recovered. Much of it was encompassed in the early\nThird Age by the kingdom of Arnor, which later split into the rival\nkingdoms of Rhudaur, Arthedain and Cardolan. The Shire occupies part of\nthe former Kingdom of Arthedain, while Bree and its neighbouring\nvillages lie on the border with the former Cardolan. The Barrow-wights\ndwell within ancient burial mounds constructed in the First Age by the\nEdain as they journeyed to Beleriand. Other important places in Eriador\nare Rivendell and the abandoned kingdoms of Eregion and Angmar. At the\nbeginning of the Second Age, large populations of both regular Men and\nDúnedain inhabited the region. There was also a group of Noldorin exiles\nliving in Eregion, near Moria and also located in the western most\nregion of Eriador (and also in Middle-earth) was the High Elven Kingdom\nof Lindon, once the greatest and mightiest kingdom of Middle\nearth. Sauron's assault on the Elves of Eregion laid waste to that land,\nand many of the Elves of the Lindon fell in the War of the Last\nAlliance. Even after his fall, Sauron's evil spirit acted through his\nagents, such as the Witch-king of Angmar, and he also concocted virulent\nplagues which swept over the land. Between warfare against the surviving\nDúnedain kingdoms, the plagues, and the general lawlessness sweeping\nover the land, the population dropped considerably. The Angmar War\nturned Eriador into a beautiful, but mostly wild and untamed land, and\nthe only concentration of Elves was either in the valley of Rivendell or\nLindon. Etymology _ERIADOR_ is a Sindarin word that meant 'Lonely land'\nor 'Lone-lands'.",

    "title": "War of the Ring",
    "page_id": "209",
    "text": "The WAR OF THE RING was fought between Sauron and the free people of\nMiddle-earth for control of the One Ring and dominion over the\ncontinent. It took place at the end of the Third Age. Together with the\nQuest of Mount Doom, it is one of the overarching plot-lines of _The\nLord of the Rings_. The war was initiated by Sauron, who had gained\nstrength since the end of the Second Age and sought the One Ring. During\nthe War of the Ring, many thousands of Men of Rohan and Men of Gondor\nwere killed. The overall number of combatants in the war is estimated to\nbe over one million—tens of thousands from the side of the Free Peoples\nand hundreds of thousands from the Evil side. The war also signified the\ndecline of the Elves' power in Middle-earth, the rise of Men in the\nWest, the restoration of the King of Gondor and Arnor and the start of\nthe Fourth Age. Battles were fought in Gondor, Rohan, Lórien, Mirkwood,\nat the Lonely Mountain and at Dale. These were primarily waged against\nSauron's forces, but Saruman, a third contender, also had armies, who\nfought battles at the Fords of Isen and Helm's Deep. The first\nfull-scale battle fought in the war was the first Battle of the Fords of\nIsen, and the war ended after the Battle of Bywater and, shortly\nafterwards, the deaths of Saruman and Gríma Wormtongue. Towards the end\nof the War of the Ring, Elessar was crowned King of Gondor, and forgave\nthe Men who had fought under Sauron, heralding a great renewal of\ncooperation and communication between Men, Elves, and Dwarves. Origins\nof the War According to Mithrandir, the War of the Ring had begun at the\ntime Thorin Oakenshield met Bilbo Baggins in The Shire. Gandalf's\nreasoning is explained in the book _Unfinished Tales_. This is an\nexcerpt from a narrative of Gandalf to Frodo set in a house in Minas\nTirith. “_You may think that Rivendell was out of his reach, but I did\nnot think so. The state of things in the North was very bad. The Kingdom\nUnder the Mountain and the Strong Men of Dale were no more. To resist\nany force that Sauron might send North to regain Angmar were only the\nDwarves of the Iron Hills, and behind them lay desolation and a Dragon.\nThe Dragon Sauron might use with terrible effect._” That is why Gandalf\nthought that he had to get rid of Smaug, and he chanced upon Thorin and\nBilbo at different times, and saw the way to do it, which is told in\n_The Hobbit_. Gandalf's role Gandalf was to the Free Peoples of\nMiddle-earth as a field marshal is to his army fighting on the field—a\nmaster strategist and tactician. As seen in the opening stages of _The\nFellowship of the Ring_ book and movie, Gandalf the Grey would spend\nmany hours, searching, scavenging, and sifting out archaic maps and\naccounts in long-hidden archives strewn about Middle-earth. He would\noften carefully examine them, figuring out the best way to defeat the\nEnemy and marshal as many allies as possible to his cause. Gandalf\nlikely spent much thought in strategy, before implementing his plans to\nmaximum effect. He had been roaming Middle-earth for many years during\nthe Third Age, before Sauron's power was at its apex. He might have had\na 'hit list' of targets to neutralize that Sauron might use in the next\nwar upon the Free Peoples. One of these targets was Smaug, as seen in\n_The Hobbit._ Gandalf's adaptability and aptitude for strategy proved\ninvaluable to his allies during the complicated web that was to prove to\nbecome the War of the Ring. As told in _Unfinished Tales_, Gandalf had\nknown for quite a while that Sauron's use of Smaug would virtually\nguarantee victory over his enemies, namely those of Gondor. He and his\nDwarf companions thus set out to destroy Smaug, and bring the victory of\nthe War of the Ring one step closer for the Free Peoples. The Roles of\nthe other Istari Saruman became the secondary enemy in the War of the\nRing, originally having served the Free Peoples and eventually\nsuccumbing to the power of the One Ring. The two Blue Wizards, Alatar\nand Pallando, also served an important role in the outcome of the war.\nAlthough they weren't directly mentioned in the _Lord of the Rings_,\nthey were enemies of Sauron, and might have used the Dark Elves and the\nDwarves of the Red Mountains to weaken the Easterlings. Events Southern\nTheatre The objective of Sauron's grand strategy was to defeat the\nstrongest of the nations that opposed him, Gondor, and to do so he would\nneed to take the capital city and greatest fortress of Gondor, Minas\nTirith. To this end, the war effort of Mordor was focused in the south\nin and around Gondor, in a strategy of divide and conquer. To keep\nGondor's ally Rohan, on its northern border, from sending aid, Sauron\npromoted the rise of Saruman at Isengard to the west of Rohan. Thus all\nof Rohan's forces would be focused in the west trying to stem the tide\nof the Isengard attack, and none would be sent to Minas Tirith's\ndefence. Meanwhile, Sauron sent the Mordor-allied Corsairs of Umbar to\nattack Gondor's populous southern coastal fiefs, which as a result sent\nonly a fraction of their forces to defend Minas Tirith in northern\nGondor, while the rest stayed on the coasts preparing for the Corsair\nassault. However, Sauron's divide and conquer strategy was ultimately\nfoiled and a united front of Gondor and Rohan's forces faced Mordor.\nRohan The War of the Ring started in Rohan when Saruman's troops crossed\nthe Fords of Isen. Théodred, the son of the King Théoden, had mustered\nhis forces on the fords in order to launch a surprise attack against the\nenemy. On February 23, 3019 he attacked the vanguard of the Orcs\nmarching out of Isengard. Reinforcements were quickly sent from Isengard\nhowever, and Théodred ordered a retreat. His forces retreated to an\nisland in the fords, but they were soon surrounded and he was killed.\nGrimbold managed to hold the island, but would not have succeeded if\nElfhelm had not come with reinforcements from Helm's Deep. Thus the\nfirst battle of the Fords of Isen ended in victory for the Rohirrim. Now\nthat the Marshal of the Westmark was dead, Erkenbrand took command of\nthe Westfold. He placed Grimbold and Elfhelm at the Fords. However, they\nwere unable to withstand the force of Isengard, and were surrounded.\nThough they successfully broke through the enemy's lines, they ended up\nscattered around the Westfold, giving Saruman clear passage into Rohan.\nMeanwhile, Gandalf drove Gríma Wormtongue out of Edoras and went to\ngather Erkenbrand's scattered forces, advising King Théoden to move to\nthe stronghold of Helm's Deep. The king and his forces arrived\nunmolested, but soon the fortress was surrounded by Saruman's troops.\nAll through the night of March 3rd-4th a combined force of Orcs and Wild\nMen from Dunland besieged Helm's Deep, and despite the efforts of the\nRohirrim (aided by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli) hope appeared lost.\nBelieving Rohan was lost, Théoden decided to mount a final, suicidal\ncharge against Saruman's forces. Unexpectedly, however, Gandalf arrived\nin the nick of time with Erkenbrand and the scattered Rohirrim, along\nwith a forest of Huorns who had been sent to the battle by Treebeard.\nThe Orcs were trapped and utterly annihilated. The wild Men were taken\ncaptive, however, were freed after swearing an oath of loyalty to Rohan\nand clearing the battlefield of the dead. (The mercy of this act amazed\nthe captives, who had been told by Saruman that the men of Rohan were\ncruel and burned their captives alive.) Days before, at an Entmoot in\nFangorn Forest, the Ents, furious over the destruction Saruman had\nwrought upon the forest, decided to march on Isengard. They were to move\nup to Isengard and destroy it. By 3 March the destruction was completed,\nand the command of Isengard was taken by the Ent Treebeard. At Gandalf's\nrequest he sent a large herd of Huorns to the Battle of Hornburg, to aid\nthe Rohirrim. Gondor For over 3000 years, the realm of Gondor had held\nback the threat from the East. In time, the kingdom declined, and Sauron\nprepared to swoop in for the kill. Faramir, captain of Gondor, had\ndivided his forces to too many fronts. The two most important of these\nwere in the island citadel of Cair Andros and the ruined city of\nOsgiliath. In a strict sense, the War of the Ring began with the Great\nSignal from Minas Morgul and the answering signal from Mount Doom, and\nthus the attack on Osgiliath was the first battle of the war proper.\nSauron's two armies obliterated the fortresses, and Faramir was forced\nto retreat to the causeway forts, the last defence against the Morgul\nforces. Soon these too were destroyed, and only Minas Tirith remained.\nThe attack soon began, as the Nazgûl hovered above and spread terror and\nconfusion, and siege towers tried to take the walls but were all\ndestroyed. After several repulsed attacks, the Gate of Minas Tirith was\nbroken, and the Lord of the Nazgûl entered. He was the first and only\nenemy to do so. All seemed lost — until six thousand Rohirrim, under\nKing Théoden's command, came and somewhat relieved Gondor's defenders.\nStill, the battle was in doubt until Aragorn arrived with a large force\nout of South Gondor. The joint force of Gondor and Rohan then\nsuccessfully defeated their enemies after an exhausting day of fighting.\nThis battle resulted in the deaths of the Witch-king of Angmar, King\nTheoden, and Denethor, Steward of Gondor. The Battle of the Morannon was\nthe final major battle against Sauron in the War of the Ring, fought at\nthe Black Gate of Mordor. The Army of the West, roughly 6,000 strong,\nled by Aragorn marched on the gate and faced a vastly larger force as a\ndiversionary feint to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo and Sam,\nwho were carrying the One Ring through Mordor. It was hoped that Sauron\nwould think Aragorn had the Ring and was now trying to use it to\noverthrow Mordor. Despite the seemingly impossible odds the Army of the\nWest was eventually victorious, for when the Ring was destroyed,\nSauron's forces fled or surrendered in dismay. Northern Theatre Mordor's\nwar effort was focused in the south against Gondor, but using his\noutstretched right arm Sauron attempted to flank the lands of the Free\nPeoples through Rhovanion, using orcs and allied barbarian nations of\nMen. In this theatre of the war (which had spread far across\nMiddle-earth) Sauron's primary objective was to use the forces at his\nprimary base of operations in the area, Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood,\nto defeat Lothlórien, then pass the Misty Mountains (attacking\nRivendell), and wheel around to take Rohan and Gondor from the rear.\nHowever, Dol Guldur had to deal with the threat of the Woodland Realm of\nThranduil, and thus split their forces between the attack on Lothlórien\nand the one on the Woodland Realm. Sauron wanted to use his barbarian\nEasterling allies in a joint attack with the Orcs from Dol Guldur on the\nWoodland Realm, and then have this victorious army link up with the\nother ones attacking Lothlórien and defeat it. However, unfortunately\nfor Sauron a strong and extremely powerful Dwarf nation now existed at\nthe Lonely Mountain thanks to the efforts of Gandalf, as well as the\nDwarves of the Iron Hills and allied Men of Dale. Mordor's Easterling\nallies were tied up fighting the Dwarves of Erebor and Men of Dale,and\nnever linked up with the Mordor forces assaulting the Woodland Realm,\nwhich in turn could not link up with those attacking Lothlórien, and the\nline held. Bridging the gap between the northern and southern theatres\nof the war was the line of the River Anduin between Lothlórien and\nGondor, running along the Rohan border. Orc armies peeling off from the\nassault on Lothlórien tried to enter Rohan via this route, while almost\nits entire army had left to fight at Minas Tirith, but the Ents of\nFangorn forest counterattacked and drove the orcs back in a panic, and\nmost if not all drowned while attempting to flee by crossing the river.\nDale and the Lonely Mountain When the war began, the Dwarves of Erebor\nrefused to cooperate with Sauron in his hunt for the Ring. And so Sauron\nsent an army of Easterlings to Dale. On March 17 they met the armies of\nthe Dwarves of Erebor (and of the Iron Hills as well) and the Men of\nDale. After three days of fighting, Men and Dwarves were overrun, Dale\nwas sacked and razed to ash (the second, possibly third, time in a\ncentury) and sought refuge in Erebor. The defenses of the Lonely\nMountain were prepared for the battle that would decide the fate of\nnorthern Middle-earth, and possibly even the War of the Ring itself. The\nEasterlings hurled their full force at the allied armies, exploiting\ntheir dreaded heavy infantry force to punch a hole in the Dwarvish and\nMannish lines. A furious melee ensued, evolving into a tempest of fire,\ndead and dying men, and the flash of steel. Both sides took horrendous\nlosses, the Easterlings from the arrows, spears, and rocks cast from the\nLonely Mountain's cliffs, and the Men and Dwarves from the scimitars and\nmaces of the Easterlings. Finally, King Brand of Dale fell before the\ngate of the Lonely Mountain, and King under the Mountain Dáin II\nIronfoot fell as he was defending Brand's body. The Dwarves of Erebor\nhad learnt a crucial lesson from the devastation of Smaug and the Battle\nof the Five Armies nearly a century earlier, a lesson bought with the\nblood of loved ones. They fortified all of the sides of the Lonely\nMountain, preventing the breakthrough of orcs that nearly caused the\nloss of the Battle in the days of Bilbo Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield.\nThe defenders knew with grim fatalism that there would be no Beorn and\nno Eagles to save them this time, and they were thus determined to fight\nto the last. The Lonely Mountain was staged to become the Minas Tirith\nof the North, a ruthless battle of the will of the defender and the will\nof the aggressor. The invaders from the east constructed siege works,\nbattering rams, and assorted siege catapults to bombard their enemies\ninto submission. However, despite all of their efforts, the great gates\nof the Lonely Mountain withstood the tidal wave of invaders from the\nEast. Many Men and Dwarves made their escape to Erebor however and were\nable to withstand the siege of the mountain fastness. When news spread\nabout the victory in the South, the Easterlings became extremely\ndemoralized and proceeded to scatter, while the sons of Brand and Dáin\nlet their army out of Erebor to break the encirclement. Lothlórien and\nMirkwood On March 11, Lothlórien was first attacked from Dol Guldur. It\nwas attacked two further times, on the 15 and the 22. When the Dark Lord\nhad fallen, Celeborn led his army out of Lóerin, and crossed the Anduin.\nDol Guldur was captured and destroyed by Galadriel. Thranduil of\nMirkwood was also attacked from Dol Guldur on March 15 resulting in the\nlong Battle Under the Trees, in which Thranduil's kinfolk won a hard\nvictory. After the destruction of Dol Guldur, Celeborn met Thranduil on\nApril 6, and as the shadow had passed, they divided Mirkwood and renamed\nit Eryn Lasgalen. The Shire After the defeat of the Dark Lord, Saruman\nused the magic of his voice to convince Treebeard to release him from\nIsengard. He travellled to the Shire, where he replaced Lotho\nSackville-Baggins as the Chief under the name _Sharkey_. Under his\ncommand Ruffian men entered The Shire and ruined it. They were defeated\nby Hobbits under the lead of Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took in\nthe Battle of Bywater on the 3rd of November. The Hobbits headed to\nHobbiton where Frodo ordered Saruman and Wormtongue to leave the Shire.\nWormtongue, however, killed Saruman, before he himself was killed by the\nHobbits and their arrows. With the death of the wizard Saruman, the War\nof the Ring finally ended, as did then the Third Age. Consequences and\nLegacy The War of the Ring had great influence on all of the lands of\nthe northwest of Middle-earth. Most importantly it led to the\nrestoration of the Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor as the Reunited Kingdom,\nunder King Elessar Telcontar. The Steward of Gondor was dead, but he was\nsucceeded by his son Faramir, who kept the office and was given the\ntitle _Prince of Ithilien_. In Rohan the heir apparent, Théodred, was\nkilled, and, during the Battle of Pelennor Fields, King Théoden died as\nwell. He was succeeded by his nephew Éomer. In the Glittering Caves at\nthe Hornburg, a Dwarven colony was established, and Isengard was given\nto the Ents, who filled Saruman's pits and reforested the land, renaming\nit The Treegarth of Orthanc In Dale, both King Brand and King Dáin II\nIronfoot were killed, who were succeeded by their sons Bard and Thorin\nIII Stonehelm. They sent their emissaries to the crowning of Elessar,\nand were in alliance with Gondor until their Kingdoms ended. For the\nElves, the final decline had begun. With the destruction of the One\nRing, the power of the Three Rings faded, and the kingdoms that had been\npreserved by their magic began to fade with them. The bearers of the\nRings left Middle-earth, and Lórien was eventually abandoned. The Elves\nof Lothlórien who did not depart over the Sea moved east to the southern\nthird of Mirkwood, below the Narrows, which they named East Lórien. In\nEryn Lasgalen however, Thranduil's rule continued, and they had peace.\nThere was also an Elven colony in Ithilien. Many of the Elves of\nRivendell departed over the Sea, and by Aragorn's death 120 years later,\nit was entirely deserted. In the Shire life continued as it had prior to\nthe war. It was declared a free land under the Sceptre of Annúminas, and\nMen were forbidden to enter it. The Westmarch was added to the Shire by\nKing Elessar in SR 1452. The different races of Men that had served\nSauron suffered grievously at the hands of what appeared to be booty and\nloot just begging them to come; much of Harad's army was annihilated on\nthe Pelennor Fields, slaughtered by the swords of Gondor and the lances\nof Rohan. The mighty Easterlings hastily retreated back to their\nhomelands after Sauron's fall and fought several territorial wars with\nKing Elessar over lands near the Sea of Rhûn, but ceased to be a threat\naltogether. While they were still a menace, much like a sleeping viper,\nthey never troubled the Reunited Kingdom again. Once the Fourth Age\nbegan, the elves stopped having an active influence on the affairs of\nMiddle-earth, having started fading away ever since the Third Age. Orcs\nnever became a serious threat again, reduced to small bands of mountain\nbrigands they were never more than a nuisance. All the Nazgûl were\nkilled, with Sauron reduced to a mere shadow of malice. Wars would still\nbe fought by the Reunited Kingdom and Rohan against the Men that had\nallied with Sauron, the Haradrim and Easterlings."

    "title": "Gondor",
    "page_id": "163",
    "text": "GONDOR was the prominent kingdom of Men in Middle-earth, bordered by\nRohan to the north, Harad to the south, the cape of Andrast and the Sea\nto the west, and Mordor to the east. Its first capital was Osgiliath,\nmoved to Minas Tirith in TA 1640. The city of Minas Tirith remained the\ncapital of Gondor for the rest of the Third Age and into years of the\nFourth Age; other major fortresses include Dol Amroth in Belfalas and\nOsgiliath, which was a city on the Anduin. Gondor was founded by the\nbrothers Isildur and Anárion, exiles from Númenor. Gondor was an allied\nkingdom with Arnor, whose line of king chieftains came from Isildur,\nwhile the Line of the Kings of Gondor was from Anárion. Gondor was at\nthe height of its power in its early years due to the ships and the\nmilitary might that its armies possessed. However, continued attacks by\nallies of Sauron, civil war, and a devastating plague caused it to\ngradually decline over the course of the Third Age until Sauron's final\ndefeat and the crowning of Aragorn II Elessar. Following that time the\npower of Gondor once again expanded, until the former lands of Arnor\nwere brought under the banner of the Reunited Kingdom.  In all, there\nwere thirty-one kings of Gondor after Anárion, who was slain before\nBarad-dûr at the Siege of Barad-dûr.  History Like Arnor to the north,\nGondor was a Mannish kingdom founded by Anárion, the youngest son of\nElendil, after the Downfall of Númenor. It was located to the South of\nRohan and to the West of Mordor, on the Bay of Belfalas. Early years\nBefore the Downfall of Númenor, Gondor was home to many Númenórean\ncolonists, who either mixed blood with the indigenous Middle Men if they\nwere friendly, or dispersed them into Ras Morthil, Dunland, and Drúadan\nForest. Gondor, at a latitude comparable to Venice, was a more fertile\nregion than Arnor to the north, and therefore it already had a larger\npopulation before the ships of Elendil's sons arrived, including a\nwell-established city, Pelargir. The Faithful or Elendili from Númenor\nwere given a warm reception upon their arrival by those that had already\ncolonized Middle-earth, including a colonial branch of Númenorean\nroyalty at Dor-en-Ernil. The colonists north of Anduin accepted\nElendil's claim to kingship over them. South of the Great River,\nhowever, the newly exiled Númenoreans did not recognize Elendil's claim.\nGondor was being founded after Númenor's population had already split\nbetween The Faithful and King's Men, and all of the more southern\ncolonies (such as Umbar) remained enemies of The Faithful. The newly\nfounded kingdom of Gondor was then part of the Last Alliance of Elves\nand Men which overthrew Sauron for the first time at the very end of the\nSecond Age, and when Isildur cut the finger of Sauron. Gondor Prospers\nAfter the war, Gondor's power and wealth grew steadily (only interrupted\nby an Easterling invasion in TA 492). Its power would continue to grow\ninto the 9th century Third Age. While the power of Gondor's sister\nkingdom Arnor peaked during the 9th century, when it broke into various\nsuccessor states, Gondor's greatest glory was yet to come. Gondor's\ngreat cities Minas Anor, Minas Ithil, Osgiliath and Pelargir only grew\nand the Dunedain of Gondor started to rule over more and more of the\nlesser people. Gondor's Golden Age Gondor's power reached its Golden Age\nunder the four “Ship-kings”: - Tarannon Falastur r. TA 830 – TA 913.\nFirst of the Ship-Kings, died childless - Eärnil I r. TA 913 – TA 936.\nNephew of Tarannon - Ciryandil r. TA 936 – TA 1015 - Hyarmendacil I\n(Ciryaher) r. TA 1015 - TA 1149. Last of the Ship-Kings. In the reign of\nthe powerful king, Hyarmendacil I (c. 12th century TA) Gondor reached\nthe height of its power. During Hyarmendacil's reign, Gondor's borders\nreached their furthest extent. The Kingdom extended east to the Sea of\nRhûn, south to the nearest lands of the Haradrim, as far north as\nMirkwood, and west towards the borders of Arnor. Such was Gondor's\nwealth during the period that men from other lands would say in envy:\n“In Gondor precious stones are but pebbles for the children to play\nwith.” Gondor would also enjoy several centuries of peace due to its\nmilitary might. The Decline of Gondor However, after decadence spread\nunder the Kings of Gondor and a long period of decline began (although\nGondor experienced several revivals). Three great calamities struck\nGondor during the second millennium of the Third Age, which are held to\nbe the chief reasons for its decline: the Kin-strife, the Great Plague,\nand the invasion of the Wainriders (a tribe of Easterlings). The\nKin-strife In the 15th century TA a great civil war named the Kin-strife\ntore the nation apart. The current King Eldacar was of mixed blood: his\nmother was of the Northmen. Popular displeasure at this led to the\noverthrow of King Eldacar by Castamir, the admiral of all of Gondor's\nnaval forces who possessed some royal blood. Eldacar's son was slain,\nand he fled north. Castamir was afterwards known as Castamir the\nUsurper. During his ten-year rule, he proved to be very cruel, and\nbecause of his love of his old fleet, he lavished attention on the\ncoastal regions while the interior provinces were ignored and left to\nrot. Eldacar then returned with an army of his Northman kinsmen, and the\narmies of the Men of Gondor joined them from interior provinces such as\nAnórien. Osgiliath was devastated during this conflict, its great bridge\ndestroyed and its _Palantír_ lost. Eldacar slew Castamir and reclaimed\nhis throne, but Castamir's sons and their forces were besieged in\nPelargir, the great port of Gondor. They eventually retreated to Umbar,\nwhere they joined with the Corsairs, and troubled Gondor for many years,\nuntil their descendants died out. The Great Plague Later, the Great\nPlague struck and the White Tree died. This Plague was no localized\nevent: the Plague swept through all of Middle-earth, reaching the\nsuccessor states of Arnor and the Hobbits of the Shire in the North.\nKing Tarondor found a sapling of the White Tree, and moved the capital\nfrom Osgiliath to Minas Anor, the City of Anárion. During this time,\nGondor was so depopulated that the fortifications guarding against the\nre-entry of evil into Mordor were abandoned. It is believed that had the\nHaradrim or Easterlings been capable of attacking Gondor at this time,\nit would have fallen. However, the Plague left Gondor's enemies in no\nbetter condition than Gondor itself, and neither side was capable of\nmounting new offensives. The Invasion of the Wainriders Following the\nsapping of Gondor's strength by the plague, it did recover but then the\nWainrider (Easterlings) invaded and devastated Gondor, and the conflict\nlasted for almost a century. The Wainriders destroyed the Northern Army\nof Gondor, but survivors linked up with the victorious Southern Army of\nGondor which destroyed the Haradrim as they crossed the river Poros, led\nby a general named Eärnil, and they destroyed the Wainriders as they\ncelebrated their victory during the Battle of the Camp. The Line of the\nKings Fails Reunification Rejected In TA 1944 Gondor faced a succession\ncrisis when King Ondoher was slain in battle with both his sons.\nArvedui, Prince of Arthedain, Ondoher's son-in-law, and the victorious\ngeneral Eärnil, who was a distant blood-relative of Ondoher, claimed the\nthrone. Arvedui's claim lay mainly in the reintroduction of the old\nNùmenorean law of accession, which stated the eldest (remaining) child\nshould succeed the king. If the law was reintroduced, then Arvedui's\nwife Fíriel, Ondoher's daughter and last remaining child, would become\nRuling-Queen, making their descendants Kings of both Arnor and Gondor.\nArvedui also tried to put weight behind his claim, as he was Isildur's\nheir. The council of Gondor recognised that the name of Isildur was held\nin honour in Gondor, but they dictated that the South-Kingdom must be\nruled by an Heir of Anarion. Due to his ancestry from Fíriel and\nArvedui, more than a millennium later, Aragorn Elessar put forward his\nclaim as the heir of both Isildur and Anarion. Eärnil laid his claim as\nbeing a direct descendant of King Telumehtar Umbardacil. His claim was\nalso greatly bolstered by the popularity he had gained as the victorious\ngeneral who saved Gondor from the Wainriders after winning the southern\ntheatre of the war. Steward Pelendur who was temporarily ruling Gondor\nas serving as arbiter of succession, intervened in favour of Gondor's\nvictorious general who would rule as Eärnil II. The Last Heir of Anárion\nDuring the Battle of Fornost, Eärnil II's heir Eärnur led Gondor's\nforces to victory over the Witch-king of Angmar, who was actually the\nLord of the Nazgûl. Although Eärnur wished to fight him, Eärnur's horse\nwas terrified and fled the battle against his wishes. By the time, he\nmastered his horse and returned the Witch-king had fled. Glorfindel the\nElf then prophesied to him that it was better that he not fight the Lord\nof the Nazgûl because “never by the hand of man shall he fall”. Eärnur\nlater ascended to the throne, ruling from Minas Anor (“Tower of the\nSun”). During this time, the Ringwraiths captured the city of Minas\nIthil (“Tower of the Moon”), renaming it _Minas Morgul_ (“Tower of Dark\nSorcery”) and taking it as their lair. Minas Anor was renamed _Minas\nTirith_ (Tower of Guard) as a result. The Lord of the Nazgûl repeatedly\nsent messengers to Minas Tirith challenging Eärnur to single combat,\ntaunting him that he had fled out of cowardice from facing him during\nthe Battle of Fornost. Eventually, King Eärnur was overcome by wrath and\nrode with a small company of knights to Minas Morgul, to accept the\nchallenge. They were never heard from again; and so ended the Line of\nAnárion. The Stewards of Gondor The Ruling Stewards A long line of\nhereditary Stewards governed the realm after the disappearance of\nEärnur, son of Eärnil, since there was no proof that the last king was\ndead, and no claimant had enough support to be accepted as his\nsuccessor. The line of Anárion was held to have failed, and Gondor was\nnot willing to risk to another Kin-strife, which would surely have\ndestroyed it. Whenever there was a new Steward, he would swear an oath\nto yield rule of Gondor back to the King, in essence only an heir of\nIsildur, if he should ever return. In Gondor, there was no one who could\nclaim descent from Isildur in direct line, and the northern line of\nArnor had effectively disappeared, so this oath was not considered\nseriously. The line of Stewards ruled as Kings, without having the\ntitle. During the War of the Ring, the ruling Steward of Gondor was\nDenethor II, and his two sons were Boromir and younger Faramir- the\nlatter being the last Ruling Steward of Gondor. Cirion and Eorl In TA\n2510 when Steward Cirion ruled over Gondor, the nation faced one of its\ngreatest perils: an Easterling tribe named the _Balchoth_ invaded Gondor\nwith mass force. Gondor's army marched to fight the Balchoth but were\ncut off from Minas Tirith and pushed back in the direction of the\nLimlight. Messengers were sent to get help from the Éothéod, a tribe,\nwhich lived in the northern vales of the Anduin, but nobody expected the\nmessengers to reach their destination. When certain peril came upon\nGondor, however, the Éothéod turned the tide of the Battle of the Field\nof Celebrant. After the victory the Éothéod were awarded the fields of\nCalenardhon north of the White Mountains from the Gap of Rohan at the\nsouthern end of the Hithaeglir, Fangorn forest, rivers Limlight to\nAnduin, western Emyn Muil, and the Mering Stream, where they established\nthe kingdom of Rohan with Eorl the Young as their first king. A\npermanent alliance between Gondor and Rohan was established by the oath\nEorl swore to Cirion. The War of the Ring and the Restoration Several\ncenturies later, Sauron had prepared for the final conquest, and in TA\n3018 his forces overran Ithilien. The attack was stopped at Osgiliath\nwith the destruction of the bridge across the Anduin. The following year\nMinas Tirith faced a larger attack from Mordor, with additional threat\nfrom the Corsairs of Umbar. Aragorn summoned the Dead Men of Dunharrow\nto destroy the forces from Umbar, freeing forces in the south of Gondor\nto come to the aid of Minas Tirith. Gondor then defeated the army of\nMordor with the aid of the Rohirrim in the Battle of the Pelennor\nFields, though with heavy losses. The combined army of the West then\ncarried the battle to Sauron at the Battle of the Morannon, a feint to\ndistract Sauron's attention from Frodo Baggins's quest to destroy the\nOne Ring in Mount Doom, thus causing Sauron's destruction and the\nallies' ultimate victory. After the second and final defeat of Sauron,\nthe Kingship was restored, with Aragorn crowned as King Elessar of the\nReunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor. Faramir, last heir of the Ruling\nStewards, retained his office as the Steward to the King, and ruled over\nGondor's eastern region of Ithilien; a fair land between the river\nAnduin and the Ephel Dúath. The oaths between Gondor and Rohan were\nrenewed, and several joint campaigns were fought in the east and south\nagainst the remnant of the Easterlings and Haradrim; all former\nterritories of the South-kingdom were won back during the following\ncenturies, and its power and wealth were restored. Several Tolkien's\nwritings state that _“...of Eldarion son of Elessar it was foretold that\nhe should rule a great realm, and that it should endure for a hundred\ngenerations of men after him, that is until a new age brought in again\nnew things; and from him should come the kings of many realms in long\ndays after”_. Armies Second Age The soldiers of Gondor were renowned\nduring the Second Age for their skill and valour. Training men of Gondor\nduring the Second Age instilled within their soldiers a martial spirit\nand ardor, goading them to fight to the death against the hordes of\nMordor, Rhûn, and Harad. Every man was physically imposing: being very\ntall at over six feet, very broad, and very strong as well. Every single\nsoldier was in peak fighting condition and ready to fight against\nSauron's hordes (especially during the War of the Last Alliance). The\nthree major weapons they used were spears, longswords, and longbows.\nThey also knew how to form cohesive box-formations, which were sturdy\nenough for both offensive and defensive purposes. The soldiers wore\nheavy plate armour and utilised large shields made out of multi-layered\nwood and edged in metal for reinforcement. Third Age Gondor's armies\nprevented Mordor and its allies from overwhelming the rest of\nMiddle-earth. Gondor was in a very crucial position, in order to guard\nMiddle Earth and because of Gondor's proximity to Mordor, its military\nforces had to be proficiently trained and vigilantly on guard at all\ntimes. Because of this, they were arguably the strongest country that\nopposed Sauron. During the Third Age, most of Minas Tirith's armies were\ntrained and drilled to fight in tight infantry formations, supported by\narchers and cavalry. Their armaments consisted of a chainmail undercoat\nwith either a black tabard or plate armor over it. Their standard\nweapons were long spears, longswords, and longbows, complimented by\ntower shields.  Minas Tirith's immediate defenses comprised thousands of\ninfantrymen stationed throughout Osgiliath, Cair Andros, and the Rammas\nEchor. These units were most likely temporary detachments from the city.\nMinas Tirith also had at least three companies of the elite Guards of\nthe Citadel, tasked to defend the upper levels of the city. They wore\nblack robes, surcoats and winged silver crowns. The Guards of the City\nwere not allowed to go in the main part of the City in their uniform.\nAdditionally, the sixth level of the city housed stables for a small\nforce of horsemen. Beyond Anduin and the defenses of Minas Tirith\noperated a secretive group of soldiers called the Rangers of Ithilien\nThe Rangers of Ithilien had guerrilla warfare aginst the Southrons,\nallies of Mordor. Similar to the Rangers of the North, the Rangers of\nIthilien were comprised of the remnant of the Dúnedain in their\nrespective Kingdom, in this case being the Dúnedain that once dwelled in\nIthilien.(the Rangers of the North were Arnorian Dúnedain, while the\nRangers of Ithilien are Gondorian- and were more populous than their\nnorthern kin).  Armed with longbows, swords, and spears, these men\nwatched and harassed the enemy throughout Ithilien, much akin to\nguerrilla warfare. The captain of the Rangers of Ithilien during the War\nof the Ring was Faramir, the younger brother of Boromir and the son of\nthe Steward of Gondor, Denethor II. The defense of Gondor's fiefdoms\nwere the responsibility of the respective lords of these territories.\nTheir training, strength in numbers, and armaments varied from each fief\n(Lossarnach brought axemen to the aid of Minas Tirith while the men of\nMorthond Vale consisted of archers). The greatest of these fiefs was Dol\nAmroth, which brought forth the largest force to Minas Tirith, made up\nof men-at-arms and arguably the best cavalry in Middle Earth- the elite\nSwan Knights. Gondor's fleet at the time of the War of the Ring was\ndocked at Pelargir. This port and the Anduin River was essential in the\ndefense of Minas Tirith. As made evident by the fiefdom's dire need to\ndefend their coasts and many rivers of Gondor, a majority of the fleet\nwas concentrated at Pelargir. This fleet was destroyed when the Black\nShips of Umbar attacked, enslaving many of Gondor's sailors into the\nservice of Mordor. Song of Gondor _Gondor! Gondor, between the Mountains\nand the Sea!_ _West Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver Tree_\n_Fell like bright rain in gardens of the Kings of old._ _O proud walls!\nWhite towers! O wingéd crown and throne of gold!_ ''O Gondor, Gondor!\nShall Men behold the Silver Tree, '' _Or West Wind blow again between\nthe Mountains and the Sea?_ This was sung by Aragorn on his trip with\nLegolas and Gimli to find Pippin and Merry. Etymology _Gondor_ name\nmeans 'Land of Stone', from Sindarin GOND (stone) + (N)DOR (land), most\nlikely given to it because of the White Mountains (Ered Nimrais) and\nother mountain chains in the land (hypothetical Quenya name ONDONÓRË).\nRegions of Gondor Gondor was divided between several nearly autonomous\nregions. These were the following: - Ithilien, a region along the east\nbank of the Anduin river under the shadow of the Ephel Dúath (Mountains\nof Shadow). Ithilien was abandoned and mostly under the control of\nMordor during The War of the Ring. (Although Gondor did have secret\nbases throughout the region such as Henneth Annûn, and the Rangers of\nIthilien used guerilla warfare tactics to harass the enemy throughout\nIthilien, and disrupt supply lines and companies marching to and from\nMordor. After the War of the Ring, Faramir was made Lord Paramount of\nIthilien by Aragorn. - South Ithilien, a portion of the the Ithilien\nsouth of Osgiliath. The road (the Harad Road) the Southrons took to get\nto Morder lied here. - Anórien, a strip of land along the northern edge\nof the White Mountains. Bordered by the Mering Stream and Rohan to the\nwest, Anduin to the east, the Mouths of Entwash to to the north, and\ntheWhite Mountainsand Rammas Echor to the south. - Lossarnach, a\nheavily-populated farmland region southwest of Minas Tirith. - Lebennin,\na plain extending from the White Mountains down to the Bay of Belfalas\nthat bordered Lossarnach. - Belfalas, a fiefdom ruled by the Princes of\nDol Amroth. - Dor-en-Ernil, a narrow strip of land along the Bay of\nBelfalas ruled by the Princes of Dol Amroth. - Lamedon, a plain between\nthe White Mountains and the River Ringló. - Anfalas or _Langstrand_, a\nnarrow strip of land along the sea bordered by the Pinnath Gelin. -\nAndrast, The western-most province of Gondor located on a narrow\npeninsula jutting out into the Sea. - Ringló Vale, a mini-province. -\nMorthond or Blackroot Vale, where Duilin comes from. The long cape of\nAndrast was not populated (by the descendants of Númenóreans, but\nevidence from the _Unfinished Tales_ suggests that a small group of\nPúkel-men inhabited it.) Additionally, Gondor held or had held the\nfollowing regions at certain points in its history: - South Gondor or\nHarondor, an arid region between the rivers Porosand Harnen, which was\ncontested between Gondor and Harad. - Calenardhon, which was given to\nthe Éothéod and became Rohan. It's boundaries were the rivers of Anduin\nin the east, Isenin the west, Limlightin the north, and the White\nMountains/ Mering Stream in the south. - Enedwaith, a region between the\nrivers Isen and Greyflood. It was never truly populated by Gondor and\nwas soon abandoned. - Rhovanion, which was never fully under the control\nof Gondor but under Gondorian control at certain times during the Third\nAge. - Ephel Dúath, the Mountains of Shadow, which was the extreme\neastern region of Gondor where she kept watch over Mordor with many\nfortresses and cities such as Minas Ithil, Durthang, and the Tower of\nCirith Ungol. Evil things re-entered Mordor after Gondor's watch upon\nthe land slackened during the Second Age. Major Sites Cities,\nFortresses, and Strongholds in Gondor included: - Cair Andros, an\nisland-fortress in the river Anduin, roughly 40 miles north of\nOsgiliath. Gondor maintained a steady garrison here, as it was of\nparamount importance to Gondor during the long war with Mordor, in order\nto prevent the enemy from crossing the river and entering into Anórien.\n- Calembel, a city in Lamedon. - Dol Amroth, a city in Belfalas ruled by\nthe Prince of Dol Amroth. - Ethring, a ford and a large township built\non either side of the river Ringló. - Henneth Annûn, a hidden refuge of\nGondorian rangers in the northern part of Ithilien along the Ephel\nDuath, the Mountains of Shadow. - Linhir, a port city in Lebennin. -\nMinas Tirith (originally Minas Anor), City of the Kings, the capital\n(Third Age) and largest city of Gondor. - Osgiliath, a city and former\ncapital of Gondor on the river Anduin, largely destroyed and abandoned\nby the end of the Third Age. During the War of the Ring, Gondor kept a\ngarrison on the west bank to prevent the Enemy from crossing the river\nand assaulting Minas Tirith. Osigiliath was the key to besiege Minas\nTirith because of its location and access to the river. Although the\nmassive Morgul-host led by the Witch-King to beseige Minas Tirith\noverwhelmed the garrison, and drove the Gondorians out thus gaining the\npassage of Anduin- the true beginning of the Siege of Gondor that would\nconclude at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. King Elessar had it\nrebuilt after Sauron's downfall. - Pelargir, the great southern harbour,\nwhich was captured by the Corsairs during the War of the Ring. The\npeople of Pelargir helped in the Batttle of Pell - Tarnost, a hill-town\nin Belfalas. Additionally, Gondor had held the following locations at\ncertain points in its history: - Angrenost (Isengard), one of the\nthree Fortresses of Gondor and held within it one of the\nrealm's Palantiri. Its location in Nan Curunir (valley at the end of\nthe Misty Mountains), was at the northwestern corner of the Southern\nKingdom of Gondor, guarding the Fords of Isen from enemy incursions\ninto Calenardhon, and together with the fortress of Helm's Deep to its\nsouth protected the Gap of Rohan. After Calenardhon was given to\nthe Éothéod by Cirion, Steward of Gondor and became Rohan, Isengard\nremained part of Gondor, and the company of Aglarond removed to the\nnorthern fortress, although the rest of Gondor almost forgot about it.\nThe small guard intermarried much with the Dunlendings , until the place\nbecame a Dunlending fortress in all but name. Orthanc, however, remained\nclosed, as the Steward of Gondor still held the keys. Isengard soon came\nall but deserted. - Durthang, the largest fortress in Mordor, originally\nbuilt to guard the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow).. - Erech, a town\nof Gondor that was abandoned by the end of the Third Age. To the north\nlay the Paths of the Dead. - Minas Ithil, a city founded by Isildur that\nwas originally the sister city of Minas Anor. Located in an upland\nvalley at the feet of the Mountains of Shadow, it was built as a\nfortress city to defend Gondor from Sauron in Mordor. It was later\nconquered by the Nazgûl and renamed Minas Morgul. - Tharbad, a city on\nboth sides of the river Greyflood, (at one time held by Gondor in the\nsouth and Arnor in the north) but abandoned as Gondor's borders recessed\nthrough Enedwaith to the Isen, and later ruined. - Tower of Cirith\nUngol, a Tower Fortress in western Mordor built by Gondor to guard the\npass of Cirith Ungol from any evil creature trying to enter -or leave-\nMordor. The Great Plague wiped out the garrison located here, so it was\neasily captured when Sauron's minions re-entered Mordor. - Towers of the\nTeeth, two towers situated on either side of the Black Gate. The two\ntowers, called Carchost and Narchost, that stand on either side\nof Cirith Gorgor, the Haunted Pass, which lies between the Ephel\nDúath (Mountains of Shadow), and the Ash Mountains. Originally built\nby Men of Gondor following the downfall of Sauron at the end of\nthe Second Age, the Towers of the Teeth were eventually taken over by\nthe servants of the Dark Lord. They were then repaired and fortified and\nwere incorporated into the defenses of the pass and gate. - Umbar, the\nfar southern harbour which was lost and reclaimed several times, in the\nend being the home of Black Númenóreans, the Corsairs of Umbar.",

    "text": "ELWING, also known as ELWING THE WHITE, was the daughter of Dior the\nFair and his wife Nimloth. She was the younger sister of the twin\nbrothers Eluréd and Elurín. She became the wife of Eärendil the Mariner,\nand was the mother of Elrond and Elros. Biography Elwing, as well as her\nbrothers, were born in a house near Lanthir Lamath and lived there until\nher father went to Doriath to assume his inheritance as King of Doriath.\nWhen the Sons of Fëanor attacked Doriath, all of her immediate family\nwas either killed or lost, but those loyal to her family took Elwing as\nwell as the Silmaril they sought and bore her away to the Havens of\nSirion. It was at the Havens that Elwing met Eärendil and later married\nhim. She bore him twin sons, Elrond and Elros. Elrond later went on to\nmarry Lady Celebrian, daughter of Lord Celeborn and Lady Galadriel of\nLothlórien. From this marriage they produced three children, Elladan and\nElrohir, twin brothers, and Arwen Undómiel, future Queen of Gondor.\nThese children were therefore Elwing's grandchildren, a privilege shared\nwith the Lord and Lady of Lothlórien. In the present matter at hand,\nElwing was forced to abandon her children when the Sons of Fëanor came\nfor the Silmaril in Elwing's possession. Rather than give it over, she\nthrew herself into the Sea and was transformed into a great white bird.\nShe flew continuously until she found her husband's sailing ship, the\nVingilot. Then, on behalf of the Elves and Men of Middle-earth, they\nchose to sail for Valinor in the faint hope that they could make a final\nplea on behalf of those who suffered under Morgoth. When they arrived,\nElwing chose to accompany her husband onto the shores, even though she\nknew it might mean her death. While Eärendil journeyed to visit the\nValar, Elwing walked the shores, eventually meeting the Elves of\nAlqualondë. There, she told them the tale of what was happening in\nMiddle-earth and became much loved by them. The Valar eventually agreed\nto go to war to aid those in Middle-earth, and also decided to give both\nEärendil and Elwing the choice of which kindred they would belong.\nEärendil, out of respect for his wife, allowed her to choose for the\nboth of them. She chose to be counted among the elves, in honor of her\nforemother, Lúthien. A white tower was later built for Elwing where she\ncould live. It was also said that the birds taught her their language\nand that she would fly to meet Eärendil when he returned from his\nnightly voyages. Etymology The name ELWING means “Star-foam”, from the\nSindarin _el_ (“star”) and _wing_ (“foam, spray”). Gallery",

This is\nbecause Tolkien saw the relationship between Rohirric and the Common\nSpeech to be the same as that of Anglo-Saxon and English, which was used\nto represent Westron. Only a few actual Rohirric words are given by\nTolkien: _kûd-dûkan_, an old word meaning “hole-dweller” which led to\n_kuduk_, the name the Hobbits had for themselves. Even these terms were\ntranslated in the book: “hobbit” is said to derive from the Anglo-Saxon\nconstruction “hol-bytla”, or hole-builder. The only other Rohirric given\nis the element “lô–”/“loh–” corresponding to Anglo-Saxon “éo” (horse),\nand the derived names _Lôgrad_ for _Horse-Mark_, and _Lohtûr_ for\n_Éothéod_, horse-people, or horse-land. All names beginning with Éo– are\nactually names beginning with Lô– or Loh–, but the real forms of Éomer,\nÉowyn etc. are not given. Only one proper name is given, that of\nThéoden: the actual form was _Tûrac_, which implies that Rohirric had\nadopted the Sindarin element “tur–” also present in names like Turgon,\nwith meaning power/mastery (i.e. King).

    "text": "THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH (abbreviated sometimes as HOME, and here as\nTHOME) is a 13-volume series of books that collects and analyses\nmaterial relating to Middle-earth, twelve of which were compiled and\nedited by the son of J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien. Most of the\ncontent consists of earlier versions of already published works by\nTolkien, while other portions are completely new material. These books\nare extremely detailed, to the point of documenting scraps of paper (of\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's) that had been erased multiple times with many\nfootnotes. Christopher Tolkien thoroughly documents the history of the\nwriting of the Middle-earth stories, with as much detail as his father\ndocumented the fictional history of Middle-earth itself. The first two\nbooks introduce readers to _The Book of Lost Tales_, a mythology for\nEngland from which Tolkien drew ideas that eventually became the\n'Silmarillion' mythology. The next three books follow the history of the\nemerging early mythology usually known as _The Silmarillion_. The\ndiscussion of the published book is deferred until book ten.

    "page_id": "224",
    "text": "UNFINISHED TALES (fully titled _UNFINISHED TALES OF NÚMENOR AND\nMIDDLE-EARTH_) is a collection of stories by J.R.R. Tolkien that were\nnever completed during his lifetime, but were edited and concluded by\nhis son Christopher Tolkien and published in 1980. Publication and\nedition Unlike _The Silmarillion_, in which the narrative fragments were\nmodified to connect into a consistent and coherent work, the _Unfinished\nTales_ are presented as Tolkien left them, with little more than names\nchanged (the author having had a confusing habit of trying out different\nnames for a character while writing a draft). Thus some of these are\nincomplete stories, while others are collections of “factual”\ninformation about Middle-earth. Each tale is followed by a long series\nof Christopher's notes explaining inconsistencies and obscure points. As\nwith _The Silmarillion_, Christopher Tolkien edited and published\n_Unfinished Tales_ before he had finished his study of the materials in\nhis father's archive. Despite its shortcomings in editorial consistency,\n_Unfinished Tales_ does provide more detailed information about\ncharacters, events and places mentioned only briefly in _The Lord of the\nRings_. Versions of such tales including the origins of Gandalf and the\nWizards, the death of Isildur and the loss of the One Ring in the\nGladden Fields, and the founding of the kingdom of Rohan help expand\nknowledge about Middle-earth. Of particular note is the tale of\nTar-Aldarion and Erendis (chapter two of Part Two), the only known story\nof Númenor before its fall. A map of Númenor is also included in the\nbook. The _Unfinished Tales_ had commercial success, demonstrating that\nthe demand for Tolkien's stories several years after his death was not\nonly still present, it was actually growing. Considering this,\nChristopher Tolkien began to embark upon the more ambitious\ntwelve-volume work entitled _The History of Middle-earth_ which\nencompassed nearly the entire corpus of Tolkien's writings about\nMiddle-earth. Contents Part One: The First Age: - “Of Tuor and his\nComing to Gondolin” - “Narn i Chîn Húrin (The Tale of the Children of\nHúrin)” Part Two: The Second Age: - “A Description of the Island of\nNúmenor” - “Aldarion and Erendis: The Mariner's Wife” - “The Line of\nElros: Kings of Númenor” - “The History of Galadriel and Celeborn” Part\nThree: The Third Age: - “The Disaster of the Gladden Fields” - “Cirion\nand Eorl and the Friendship of Gondor and Rohan” - “The Quest of Erebor”\n- “The Hunt for the Ring” - “The Battles of the Fords of Isen” Part Four\n- “The Drúedain” - “The Istari” - “The Palantíri”"

    "page_id": "240",
    "text": "MINAS TIRITH (IPA: ) was the capital of Gondor in the Third Age and the\nFourth Age of Middle-earth. Originally known as MINAS ANOR, the “Tower\nof the Setting Sun”, it replaced the city Osgiliath as the new capital\nand stockade of Gondor. When the Enemy began to take shape again, Minas\nAnor was renamed Minas Tirith, the “Tower of Guard.” The city was also\ncalled THE WHITE CITY, as the courtyard in the front of the city's\nCitadel contained the White Tree. Many important events took place in\nand in front of the city, such as the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the\nhealing of Éowyn by Aragorn after the battle, and the coronation of\nAragorn II Elessar. Layout Minas Tirith was surrounded by the Rammas\nEchor, a large ringwall encircling the city and the Pelennor Fields.\nThis wall was built after Minas Ithil fell and was renamed Minas Morgul.\nIt was repaired by Ecthelion II during the time of the War of the Ring,\nbut it had not the strength to defend the city from the Dark Lord\nSauron's legions of Uruk-hai from Mordor. The city itself lay on a hill\nbeneath Mount Mindolluin, which rose above the city's citadel, by a\nlength of a couple of thousand feet. Mount Mindolluin was where Aragorn\nfound the seedling of the White Tree. The city was divided into seven\none-hundred-foot high levels, each surrounded by white walls, except the\nfirst walls which had the same kind of black stone as Orthanc as a face.\nThe gates connecting the levels did not lay behind one another in a\nline, but faced in different directions. A spur of rock, whose summit\nwas level with the city's uppermost tier, jutted out from the front of\nthe city in an easterly direction, dividing all but the first level into\ntwo. Each level was scattered with many alleys, narrow passageways, and\nfull-fledged houses (which were probably quite rare in the city). On the\nsixth level were located the Houses of Healing, surrounded by pleasant\ngardens. Finally, within the seventh wall, was the Citadel of Minas\nTirith, with the White Tower of Ecthelion - three hundred feet high, so\nthat its apex was one thousand feet above the plain. Levels The First\nLevel of Minas Tirith was the lowest level of Minas Tirith where was the\nMain gate. During the Siege of Minas Tirith, Uruk-hai cast fire into the\nFirst Level, burning many buildings and causing general havoc to many of\nthe defenders. Later on, the Main Gate was breached when Grond was\nfinally used against it, and the soldiers of Gondor and Uruk-hai clashed\nin the streets of the First Circle but Aragorn ordered a retreat and\nthen made their way up. History Minas Tirith (as Minas Anor) was built\nin SA 3320. King Ostoher rebuilt the city in TA 420, and, gradually, it\nbecame more important than Osgiliath, the original capital, which in\nlater years fell into ruin. King Tarondor finally moved the King's House\nto the city in TA 1640, thereby making it the official capital of the\nkingdom of Gondor. In the year TA 2002, the White City's companion tower\nMinas Ithil (the “Tower of the Moon”) on the borders of Mordor was\ncaptured by the Ringwraiths and renamed Minas Morgul (the “Tower of\nSorcery”). Minas Anor was then renamed Minas Tirith, meaning the “Tower\nof Guard”, to indicate that, since the fall of Minas Ithil, Minas Tirith\nwas the only thing that defended Gondor and all the other lands around\nand behind it against the darkness from Mordor. The Rammas Echor, the\ngreat wall encircling the rich farmlands and suburbs of the City, was\nbuilt at this time. War of the Ring Minas Tirith only has Gondorian\nsoldiers while the civilians dwell in Osgiliath with several Gondorian\nsoldiers. After the Uruk-hai attacked and overran Osgiliath a thousand\nsoldiers were killed while the remaining thousand soldiers fled to Minas\nTirith while the civilians were evacuated to Rohan. The remaining\ngondorian soldiers entered Osgiliath and once the uruk-hai were slain\nthe civilians departed from Rohan and returned to Osgiliath. Siege of\nMinas Tirith Minas Tirith was besieged by the armies of Mordor, under\nthe Great Darkness generated by Sauron's power. The Battle of the\nPelennor Fields took place on March 15, 3019 in the fields surrounding\nthe city. It was a very large battle. Theoden, the King of Rohan was\nkilled during this battle by the Witch-king of Angmar. At about the same\ntime, the Witch-king was destroyed by Éowyn, lady of Rohan, who was\nseverely wounded in the process. It was also there that Gandalf took\ncommand of the City's defenses from the Ruling Steward Denethor after he\nfell to despair. Aragorn later arrived at the hour of need with Gondor's\nArmy of the South which he had liberated from defending the port city of\nPelargir, turning the tide of battle in favor of the Free Peoples. After\nthe battle, the stench of death was heavy in Minas Tirith's air, and the\nPelennor Fields lay strewn with bodies. Fourth Age On 1 May 3019, the\nCrowning of King Elessar took place on the plain outside Minas Tirith.\nAfter his coronation, he entered the city as the King of Gondor, as he\nwas destined to become from the start of his lifetime. With his\ncoronation, King Elessar refounded the line of the Kings of Gondor, and\nas he was also the King of the Kingdom of Arnor, Minas Tirith became\nCapital of the Reunited Kingdom. Minas Tirith was repaired by its new\nking (who grew plants inside of its walls to add to its luster and\nbeauty) and by the Dwarves of Glittering Caves, particularly Gimli, who\nbuilt a new gate for the city (made of mithril and steel) and altogether\nfixed the layout of the city as well. Minas Tirith was said to have been\nmade even more beautiful than when it was at the time of its founding.\nThe city is known to have stood firm and strong well into the Fourth Age\nbecause of these two renovations. In _The Silmarillion_, as Of The Ring\nOf Power And The Third Age says, after War of the Ring, the city is\nreferred to as Minas Anor again after the overthrow of Sauron and the\ndestruction of Barad-dûr.",

    "title": "Lindon",
    "page_id": "248",
    "text": "LINDON was a Elven Kingdom founded by Gil-galad at the beginning of the\nSecond Age. It was the longest-standing Eldarin Kingdom in the history\nof Middle-earth, and the mightiest throughout the Second Age. It was\nruled by its founder, Gil-galad, the High King of the Ñoldor, who,\nduring that age, was the strongest and most powerful enemy of Sauron in\nMiddle-earth. The realm endured through the Third Age, though\ndiminished, and was the site of the Grey Havens, where the Elves, as\nwell as the Ring-bearers, sailed to the Undying Lands. Description\nLindon was located in what remained of Ossiriand; the Land of Seven\nRivers and all that was left of the peninsula of Beleriand after the War\nof Wrath. The mountains, partially sunk in the ruin of Beleriand, formed\na portion of the realm's east border. The realm reached as far north\nover the mountains as the Little Lune. North of that boundary was what\nremained of the Dwarf kingdom of Belegost. After the ruin of Beleriand,\nGil-Galad founded the realm of Lindon, which encompassed all the land\nwest of the Blue Mountains and east of the sea in the North of\nMiddle-earth. The Gulf of Lune broke the realm of Lindon into Forlindon\nand Harlindon. The Grey Havens lay at the mouth of the river Lune.\nThrough a break in the Blue Mountains, the land of Eriador lay to the\neast, and farther southeast laid the Shire. Eastward also lay the\nKingdom of Eregion, at the feet of the Misty Mountains, which was also\nruled by Gil-Galad under the lordship of Celebrimbor. Towards the end of\nthe Second Age, the realm of Arnor was established by Elendil to the\nnortheast of Lindon. The lands of Lindon were said to be lush and green,\nwith thick forests lining the foothills of the Blue Mountains. The\nhavens of the elves were found along the Gulf of Lune, where the land\nbecame rocky yet lush along the coast. Tolkien stated that Lindon was\nElven country “where no Man dwells”. It was the last realm that was fair\nand free. It also had a mildly tempered climate, with mild winters and\nmild summers. History Before the Second Age _Lindon_ was another name\nfor the Ossiriand in East Beleriand, where the Laiquendi dwelt. Second\nAge After the War of Wrath, those Elves who had sought refuge on the\ncoast of the sea at the mouths of the river Sirion removed into the land\nthat was left in the northwest of Middle-earth. They, led by Gil-Galad,\nestablished the realm of Lindon in SA 1. In the North at Forlindon\nGil-galad ruled a majority of Noldorin Elves. In southern Harlindon,\nCeleborn ruled a fiefdom of many Sindar and the remaining Green Elves of\nBeleriand under Gil-Galad. He did not rule under Gil-galad for long,\nthough, eventually removing to the shores of Lake Nenuial with his wife,\nGaladriel. At the Grey Havens Círdan was the lord of many shipbuilders\nof the Teleri who survived the ruin of the First Age. The Elves believed\nnow that the threat of Morgoth was removed, and Lindon became a fair\nkingdom. Gil-galad and the Elves of Lindon had a very strong friendship\nwith Númenor and its kings before the Darkening of Númenor. Early in the\nsixth century of the Second Age, the first ships of Númenor returned to\nMiddle-earth. Vëantur, father-in-law of Tar-Meneldur, led the first\nexpedition. Later he returned with his grandson and heir to the throne,\nAldarion, and the Númenoreans were well liked by Gil-galad and his\npeople. Tar-Aldarion continued his voyages to Lindon throughout his\nreign as the sixth King of Númenor, and Gil-galad and Círdan taught much\nto the mariners of Númenor. Gil-galad befriended Aldarion and gave him\nand his father, Tar-Meneldur, many gifts. After the reign of Aldarion,\nNúmenor was less active in the affairs of Lindon for many hundred years,\nthough friendship remained. In the twelfth century, Sauron attempted to\ninfiltrate Lindon disguised as 'Annatar', the Lord of Gifts. His\nstrength now on the mend after Morgoth's defeat, Sauron purposed to\ncorrupt the strongest of all the remaining Elf-kingdoms. Gil-galad\ndenied him, and so did Elrond, who dwelt then with the King in\nForlindon. Though they did not know Annatar's true identity at the time,\nthe wise king of Lindon foresaw evil in Annatar. Sauron then turned his\nattention to Eregion, where he succeeded in befriending the Noldorin\nsmiths under Celebrimbor who worked there. After Sauron forged the One\nRing at the beginning of the sixth century, he declared war on the\nElf-kingdoms to capture the Rings of Power they had hidden from him.\nGil-galad sent a small army led by Elrond east to the aid of Eregion.\nThere he joined with Celeborn, but Sauron's forces defeated the combined\nforce. His army ravaged Eregion and the rest of Eriador, and came to the\nborders of Lindon. There, Gil-galad's forces dug in against the forces\nof Sauron, and were strengthened by a great fleet sent from Númenor by\nTar-Minastir, the King of Númenor, under his son and heir Ciryatan. With\nthe aid of the Númenoreans, participating in their first war upon\nMiddle-Earth, Lindon was freed and Sauron's forces overthrown. Sauron\nreturned to Mordor and focused his attention now on ruining Númenor. In\nthe year SA 3319 of the Second Age, Númenor was destroyed, and Elendil\nand sons and his remnant of Faithful Númenoreans landed on the coast of\nMiddle-earth. Elendil established the Realms in Exile which were the\nNorth-Kingdom of Arnor and the South-Kingdom of Gondor. He became close\nfriends and ally with Gil-galad, and they pledged support to one another\nagainst the preparing blow of Sauron, who had risen to power once again\nafter fleeing the ruin of Númenor. The War of the Last Alliance began in\nSA 3434, and the Elves of Lindon formed a large part of the backbone of\nthe Elven armies. Elendil's Númenorean refugees, along with Dúnedain who\nhad removed to Middle-Earth before the destruction of Númenor, marched\nalongside the host of Gil-galad, and eventually they laid siege to the\nDark Tower. Sauron himself then came to battle, and fought Gil-galad and\nElendil. The two kings defeated him but died in the process. Then,\nIsildur son of Elendil cut the ring from Sauron's hand, and he was for a\ntime defeated. Third Age After the death of Gil-galad, the lordship of\nLindon passed to Círdan; and the line of Noldorin kings in Middle-Earth\ncame to an end. The population of Lindon had been reduced by the long\nand bloody war with Sauron. With the loss of their king, many of the\nNoldor and Sindar left for Valinor. Following the war, many Elves began\nto come to the Grey Havens and sail to Valinor, further depleting\nLindon's population. Círdan continued his shipbuilding, and had much\nwork constructing the vessels to carry the Elves west. However, the\nkingdom began to dwindle as the ships continued to sail. The Witch-king\nof Angmar attacked the Kingdom of Arnor in the thirteenth century of the\nThird Age. Lindon lent what aid it could to the Dúnedain, but after many\nyears, the North-Kingdom was overthrown. The Dúnedain went into exile,\nand the kingdom of Lindon shrank rapidly into a safe haven for the Elves\nof Middle-earth. By the time of the War of the Ring, it was a shadow of\nits former glory, with only Grey Havens seeing regular traffic and\nactivity. After Sauron's defeat, the last Elves began to sail for\nValinor, and Círdan remained there well into the Fourth Age, awaiting\nthe last ship to sail west himself. Etymology The name _LINDON_ means\n“Land of the Singers”, from the Quenya term _lin_ or _lind_ (“to sing,\nmake musical sound”) and _-on_, which is a common suffix for regions.",

    "title": "Misty Mountains",
    "page_id": "225",
    "text": "The MISTY MOUNTAINS, also named the _HITHAEGLIR_ , was a mountain range\nthat ran 1280 kilometres (795.35 miles) from north to south between\nEriador and the valley of the Great River, Anduin, and from Mount\nGundabad in the far north to Methedras in the south. An early version of\nthis range's name was _ERED HITHUI_ . Geographical description The\nrange's notable peaks were Caradhras, Celebdil, Fanuidhol, Mount\nGundabad, and Methedras. Location The northernmost peak of the Misty\nMountains was Mount Gundabad; where according to legend Durin (eldest of\nthe Seven Fathers of the Dwarves) awoke, though it became an abode and\nmountain-fortress of Orcs. The greatest Dwarven realm in Middle-Earth,\nKhazad-dûm (later named Moria), was located at the midpoint of the Misty\nMountains. The three peaks that were part of Khazad-dûm were Caradhras\n(Redhorn), Celebdil (Silvertine) and Fanuidhol (Cloudyhead). Inside\nCelebdil, the Dwarves built the Endless Stair, from the foundations of\nthe mountain to the top of it. The southernmost peak of the Misty\nMountains was Methedras, meaning “the Last Peak”. Routes through the\nMisty Mountains The most important passes were the High Pass and the\nRedhorn Pass. There was also a pass at the source of the Gladden river.\nRoutes around the Misty Mountains The Gap of Rohan was the valley\n(probably of the River Isen) between the southernmost peaks of the Misty\nMountains and the northernmost of the White Mountains. There may have\nbeen a gap between Mount Gundabad in the Misty Mountains and the\nwesternmost extremity of the Grey Mountains, though published maps\ndiffer on this point. Inhabitants Under the Misty Mountains were the\nformer Dwarf realm of Khazad-dum, and the “Goblin-town” in which Bilbo\nBaggins stumbled across the One Ring, which had been in the possession\nof the creature Gollum, who also dwelt there himself on the eastern\nside. Rivendell was hidden in the foothills of the Misty Mountains at\nthe western end of the High Pass. Carn Dûm, where the Witch-King of\nAngmar resided for several centuries in the Third Age, lay between a\nwestern spur of the northern extreme of the range, known as the\nMountains of Angmar. Mount Gundabad, the largest Goblin dwelling in the\nMisty Mountains, was located south-east of Angmar. Isengard lay centered\naround the Tower of Orthanc in Nan Curunír, the valley between the arms\nof Methedras, which was the southernmost peak of the Misty Mountains.\nThe “stone-giants” also inhabited this mountain range, as told in _The\nHobbit_. History Origins The Misty Mountains were created by Melkor\nduring the Time of the Trees, who wanted to make it difficult for Oromë,\nwho often rode across Middle-earth hunting his fell beasts, to pass.\nYears of the Trees The Dwarves of Durin awoke under Mount Gundabad and\nlater established the caves of Khazad-dûm. Later, when the Elves on\ntheir Great Journey to Valinor looked upon their terrible height a\nportion of the Teleri, later known as the Nandor grew afraid and turned\nsouth down the Great River. Thousands of years later, the Ñoldor\nreturned to Middle-earth and established great realms in the Beleriand\nand in the highlands, but they never crossed the mountains or\nestablished realms within them. First and Second Ages Over three-hundred\nyears into the First Age, the tribes of Men crossed the Misty Mountains\nand began migrating into the Beleriand, first the Edain and then later\nthe Easterlings or Swarthy Men. After the defeat of Morgoth, the\nsurviving orcs and a Balrog came to live there and would remain a\nproblem for over six-thousand years. The Easterling men who fought with\nMorgoth crossed the mountains and began living east of the Wilderland in\nRhûn. The Great Eagles also began living here in a place known as the\nEagles Eyrie. The great Dwarven realm of Khazad-dûm beneath the Misty\nMountains thrived as good relations with the Ñoldor of Eregion were\nestablished, until Sauron invaded Eriador from Mordor and the east\ndestroying Eregion and ravaging the lands beyond. The dwarves survived\nby shutting themselves in Khazad-dûm behind the Doors of Durin. Third\nAge In TA 1980, the great Dwarven realm of Khazad-dûm came to an end\nwhen the Dwarves unearthed a Balrog which led to its desertion by TA\n1981, after which it was known as Moria (literally, “black chasm”).\nSlowly, the Misty Mountains became increasingly perilous and dangerous\nto travelers as Goblins and other creatures came to dwell under there.\nAlmost a thousand years later, the thirteen Dwarves, Gandalf, and Bilbo\nBaggins used the High Pass to cross the Misty Mountains during the Quest\nfor the Lonely Mountain, and were captured by Goblins whilst crossing.\nUnder the mountains, the Great Goblin was slain, and Bilbo found the One\nRing. The Fellowship of the Ring tried to cross the Redhorn Pass (after\nrejecting the High Pass leading to Rhovanion as being watched by the\nEnemy, and the Gap of Rohan as taking the Fellowship too close to\nIsengard), but a blizzard forced it to go under the mountain instead of\nover it. They faced a Balrog that dwelt in the deserted realm of\nKhazad-dûm. Gandalf slew the Balrog by casting it down from Zirakzigil,\nbut it had worn his life already, and on that high ground he lay until\nGwaihir bore him to Lothlorien.",

    "text": "_THE ADVENTURES OF TOM BOMBADIL_ is a collection of poetry by J.R.R.\nTolkien, published in 1962 (ISBN 0044407262). The book contains 16\npoems, only two of which deal with Tom Bombadil, a character who is most\nfamous for his encounter with Frodo Baggins in _The Fellowship of the\nRing_, the first volume in Tolkien's best-selling _The Lord of the\nRings_. The rest of the poems are an assortment of bestiary verse and\nfairy tale rhyme. The book was illustrated originally by Pauline Baynes\nand later by Roger Garland. Editions 2014 Edition The 2014 release can\nbe seen as a kind of special edition as it not only includes the main\npublished poems and artwork, but also a new Introduction, 'commentary'\nsection that discusses the history of each poem, and secondary early\nversions of the poems. It also includes an appendix with an unreleased\nfragment of prose story about Tom Bombadil, and two additional poems:\n_Once Upon A Time_ and _An Evening in Tavrobel_. Canon The book, like\nthe first edition of _The Fellowship of the Ring_, is presented as if it\nis an actual translation from the Red Book of Westmarch, and contains\nsome background information on the world of Middle-earth which is not\nfound elsewhere. Examples are the name of the tower at Dol Amroth and\nthe names of the Seven Rivers of Gondor. There is some dispute about its\ncanonical status since the information presented about the secondary\nworld is considered only as folklore among the Hobbits. _Tom Bombadil_\ncan best be seen as a small, poetic venture into Tolkien's imagination."

The laws of Númenor at that time\nwould not allow her to rule as queen, so she wedded Elatan of Andúnië\nand took up residence there. Their son Valandil would be named the first\nLord of Andúnië in about the seventh century of the Second Age.\nThroughout the Second Age, the Lords of Andúnië became leaders of the\nElendili, or Elf-friends, for remaining friends with the Elves and\nfaithful to the Valar. This was despite opposition and eventually\npersecution from the King's Men. At the end of the Second Age, Númenor's\nestrangement from the Elves and the Valar under the evil guidance of\nSauron corrupted Númenórean society.

Even at the southern latitude of Gondor and Rohan, the White\nMountains bore snow even in summer, suggesting they were extremely high.\nThe range had no passes. The Paths of the Dead passed under it, but only\nthe most courageous (or foolhardy) ever ventured that route. The White\nMountains formed the northern boundary of Gondor and the southern\nboundary of Rohan except in their easternmost provinces, where Gondor's\nprovince of Anorien lay to the north of the mountains. Because of their\nalways bearing snow at their highest peaks, the White Mountains must\nhave been at least 4800 meters (16'000 feet) above sea level, with\noccasional peaks probably in excess of 5500 meters. They were, however,\nnot as high as the Misty Mountains. Its notable peaks included\n_Irensaga_ “Iron Saw” and _Starkhorn_. Between these two lay the\n_Dwimorberg_, entrance to the Paths of the Dead. At the eastern end, the\ncity of Minas Tirith was carved into _Mindolluin_ mountain. The Warning\nbeacons of Gondor were placed on top of seven peaks in the range: _Amon\nDîn_, _Eilenach_, _Nardol_, _Erelas_, _Min-Rimmon_, _Calenhad_ and\n_Halifirien_. Several rivers raised in the White Mountains, among them:\nthe Adorn (a tributary of Isen), and the Snowbourn and Mering Stream\n(tributaries of the Entwash); and, on the south side, the Erui (a\ntributary of Anduin), the Ringló and its tributary Ciril (which together\nwith the Morthond all entered the Bay of Belfalas at Edhellond near Dol\nAmroth), the Lefnui of the Anfalas, and the Five Rivers of Lebennin.\nHistory The natives to the White Mountains were Drúedain who inhabited\nthis region in the Second Age. The only remnants of the Druedain's\npresence in this mountain range were their statues called the\n_Púkel-men_. Sometime thereafter, evil men related to the Dunlendings\ndrove the Drúedain out. Some of these men swore allegiance to Isildur,\nbut betrayed him and were cursed into the Army of the Dead. Aragorn,\nLegolas, and Gimli followed the Paths of the Dead in year 3019 of the\nThird Age and convinced the army to fight for Gondor in the War of the\nRing. After they did so, Aragorn released the Army of the Dead, for they\nhad fulfilled their oath. After and perhaps before the War of the Ring\nDwarves settled in the White Mountain, where they could have better\ncontact with their allies.

The forest is remembered most for when the Riders of Rohan\nwhere guided through the forest on their way to the relief of Minas\nTirith, by their leader Ghân-buri-Ghân. There was a road there, created\nlong ago by the “Stonehouse-folk” (Men of Gondor), that everyone except\nthe Wild Men had forgotten. It would have taken the Drúedain from\nsunrise to noon to walk it, but it required around ten hours for all of\nRohan's army to get through.

    "text": "The BATTLE OF FORNOST was the decisive battle between the forces of\nAngmar, under the Witch-king, and of Eärnur, the Crown Prince of Gondor,\nin the year TA 1975 that ended the evil northern Kingdom of Angmar.\nHistory A year prior to the battle, the armies of Angmar conquered\nArthedain, the last realm of Arnor. Angmar's armies had taken Fornost,\nthe capital of the Dúnedain, and Arvedui, the last King of Arnor, had\ndrowned in the Ice-Bay of Forochel. A year later, a fleet of ships under\nEärnur arrived in the Grey Havens and set off toward what was left of\nthe once-great northern kingdom. With the armies of Gondor came men from\nRhovanion, elves from Lindon, and the remainder of the Dúnedain (among\nthem Aranarth, the Prince of Arthedain). According to Shire historians,\na company of archers was also sent to the battle. The battle itself did\nnot take place in the city of Fornost, but on the plains to the west of\nthe city, near Lake Evendim. The armies of Angmar hurried west to meet\nthe assault, and seeing this, the cavalry of Gondor rode north into the\nHills of Evendim to wait in ambush. As the main part of the army of\nGondor met the enemy in battle, the Gondor cavalry set out from the\nhills to strike the rear of the army of Angmar. This served as the\nturning point in the battle, and allowed the combined armies of the west\nto gain the advantage. Realizing that his forces were all but completely\ndestroyed, the Witch-king of Angmar fled eastward. As he fled, an army\nled by Glorfindel came up out of the south and blocked his escape,\ndestroying what was left of his crumbling army; the Witch-king himself\nwas able to escape during the night and fled southward. Though the\nbattle itself had been lost and Angmar utterly destroyed, Sauron was\nextremely pleased with the Witch-King's work, for the destruction of the\nnorthern kingdoms of the Dúnedain was a victory for the Dark Powers\nwhich far exceeded the loss of the Witch-King's realm."

    "text": "The Kin-strife was a disastrous civil war in Gondor in the Third Age.\nBackground The unrest that created the Kin-strife began when Valacar,\nthe son of the Gondor king Rómendacil II, married a woman of the\nNorthmen of Rhovanion, Vidunavi. She bore him a son Eldacar, but many of\nthe people of Gondor of Númenórean blood were angered by this mixing of\nblood of Middle Men and Númenóreans, and the coastal provinces rebelled\nwhen Valacar grew old. Civil War When in TA 1432 Eldacar succeeded his\nfather the unrest grew into open rebellion, as many people saw Eldacar\nas a half-breed who had no right to rule. The chief of them was his\ndistant relative Castamir the Usurper, Lord of Ships, who in TA 1437\nusurped the throne, forcing Eldacar into exile. Castamir was supported\nby the people of the realm of Umbar, who sought revenge against Gondor.\nDuring the rebellion Osgiliath was burned, and the great Dome of Stars\nwas lost, together with its Palantír. Castamir also murdered Eldacar's\nson and heir Ornendil. Eldacar fled to Rhovanion, and Castamir ruled in\nhis stead. A full decade later, in TA 1447, Eldacar returned with\nRhovanion troops; at the same time a rebellion against Castamir's cruel\nrule took place. Eldacar managed to kill Castamir at the Battle of Erui,\nbut Castamir's sons and many of their supporters fled south to Umbar.\nEldacar could not follow them, as the fleet was under Castamir's\ncontrol. Not only did Gondor lose the city of Umbar for four centuries\nand gain a new enemy in the Corsairs of Umbar, descendants of Castamir's\nsons, but also many of the Númenóreans of purest blood were killed\nduring the civil war, leaving Gondor weakened. The Kin-strife was, along\nwith the Great Plague and sheer laziness one of the chief reasons for\nthe abandonment of the fortresses in and surrounding Mordor."

    "text": "DUNLAND was the land of the wild men, or 'Dunlendings'. _Dunland_ means\n_Hill Land_ in the language of neighboring Rohan, whose people named it\nafter arriving in nearby Calenardhon in the later Third Age. Inhabitants\nDunland was inhabited by the Dunlendings, Men who were mostly bearded\nand had dirty faces, and long matted hair. They wore clothes of leather\nand animal skin and carried weapons that were simple but effective for\ntheir purpose. They usually fought with clubs and pitchforks, and at\ntimes they carried torches to act as lights at night and to burn\nbuildings by day. The buildings that Dunlendings lived and worked in\nwere crude shacks of wood and animal skin that were often sabotaged by\nWargs and sometimes the Rohirrim. The vernacular of this land's\ninhabitants, including possibly the Stoors, was Dunlendish. Ancestors of\nthe Dunlendings inhabited the forested regions of Middle-earth on either\nside of the Gwathló in the early Second Age; thus the early Númenóreans\ncalled them _Gwaithuirim_. They spoke a language related to that of the\nSecond House of Men, the Haladin, rather than the vastly different\nBëorian-Marachian tongue which stood at the base of Adûnaic, and this\nlack of mutual understanding led to outright hostility. The Númenóreans\ngreedily harvested _Gwaithuirim_ forests for timber, and after much war\nand bloodshed, the _Gwaithuirim_ from south of the Gwathló fled east to\nthe Hithaeglir while others scattered to the cape of Eryn Vorn and the\nWhite Mountains. At the end of the Second Age, the land north of the\nGwathló and south of the Baranduin was named Minhiriath “Land between\nthe Rivers”, although the land south of Minhiriath remained unnamed. Its\ninhabitants were largely ignored despite the fact that the Gondor\ncolonial city of Tharbad grew up on the Gwathló west of the Misty\nMountain hillfolk who had been _Gwaithuirim_ long before. It was not\nuntil Gondor abandoned this city in TA 2050 that the people and their\nland were renamed: both became known as Enedwaith “Middle-Folk, Middle\nRegion”, because they owed no allegiance to the North or South Kingdom.\nThe Hillfolk of the Hithaeglir kept their hatred of the descendants of\nNúmenor (unlike those of Eryn Vorn and the White Mountains, who\nnevertheless remained uncooperative). The Dead Men of Dunharrow who\nbetrayed Isildur were descended from _Gwaithurim_.\nIn T.A. 2770, Smaug the Dragon destroyed the Kingdom under the Mountain.\nDwarves fleeing from this disaster settled in Dunland, from\nwhere Thrór departed when he and his companion Nár journeyed\nto Moria in T.A. 2790. After the Battle of Azanulbizar, provoked by\nthe Orcs' brutal slaying of Thrór, Thráin II and Thorin led the remnants\nof their followers back to Dunland but soon left (to eventually settle\nin the Blue Mountains). When Gondor decided to give the depopulated\nprovince of Calenardhon to the numerous people of Éothéod in TA 2510,\nthe Hillfolk of the Hithaeglir felt threatened by these _Forgoil_\n“Strawheads” (a demeaning reference to the blonde hair of the refugees\nfrom Calenardhon). The Hillfolk had slowly colonised Calenardhon during\nthe dwindling of the Dúnedain and had already reclaimed all the land\nbetween the Adorn and Isen. Still, open war was not waged until the\nreign of Helm Hammerhand (TA 2741 - TA 2759). Freca, the Lord of the\nHillmen (whom the Rohirrim now called Dunlendings) tried to get the\nthrone of Rohan for himself by petitioning for the marriage of his son\nWulf to the daughter of Helm. The Hill-men leader Freca was killed and\nWulf led the Dunlendings into open war with Rohan. They unsuccessfully\nbesieged the Hornburg during the Long Winter of TA 2758 - TA 2759. Wulf\ndid take Edoras and killed Haleth, the son of Helm, in front of the\ngolden hall of Meduseld. Nonetheless, Helm's nephew Fréalaf held out\nagainst the Dunlendings in the refuge of Dunharrow. He recaptured Edoras\nat the end of the Long Winter and killed Wulf personally. The\nDunlendings were driven out of Rohan, and Fréalaf succeeded the deceased\nHelm Hammerhand. Guarding the Gap of Rohan was the fortress of Isengard,\nwhere a hereditary guard watched for Gondor. However, by the time of the\nSteward of Gondor Beren, these guards had mixed with Dunlendings, and it\nhad become hostile to Gondor. To remedy this situation, Beren gave\nSaruman the keys to Orthanc to guard Isengard for Gondor. Saruman used\nthe historical hostility against outlanders to tempt the Dunlendings\ninto supporting him during the War of the Ring. In The Two Towers\nextended edition, the Dunlending warlord is shown giving a blood-oath to\nSaruman. After the battle at Helm's Deep, the Rohirrim allowed the\nsurviving Dunlendings to return to their homes. The Rohirrim required\nthat all hostilities cease and that the Dunlendings again retreat behind\nthe Isen.

The new king, Telemnar was killed together with\nhis kin, as well as many others of the Dúnedain. Together these events\nserved to further destroy the people of Gondor. Movement of the Plague\nThe Plague had first hit Rhûn and Rhovanion, and after the plague had\npassed more than half the folk of the Kingdom of Rhovanion had been\nkilled. From Osgiliath the plague spread west and then north. Enedwaith\nand Dunland were scarcely affected, but the Plague regained strength as\nit went north, and Minhiriath (the southern part of Cardolan) was\nespecially hit hard. The last of the Dúnedain of Cardolan died on the\nBarrowdowns, and evil spirits from Angmar and Rhudaur entered the realm.\nArthedain further to the north was scarcely affected, while the Shire\nwas hit harder, with the Hobbits suffering great losses. Arthedain still\ndefended Fornost to the north. The city of Osgiliath was especially hit\nhard, suffering the highest casualties outside of Rhovanion. Many fled\nthe city and re-located to Ithilien and Anórien, and Minas Anor became\nthe King's seat there. After the Plague The casualties were so high that\nthe fortresses guarding Mordor were abandoned as the troops were\nrecalled. For the next two centuries Gondor, as well as its enemies, did\nlittle but try to regain strength. Eventually Gondor did recover and\ngarrisoned the fortresses for a short time."

Description This iconic tree was in\nappearance a tall spacious tree of graceful form, white thin unwrinkled\nbark over white wood. In spring it bore numerous white flowers, but few\nof these ever fructified; what shape the fruit was is never described,\nnor is it considered to be edible. The leaves were laurel-like, dark\ngreen above and bright silver beneath. The wood when burned gives off a\ndense, choking, volumnious smoke that forms a fog capable of burying an\nentire country in darkness for several days. It was fashioned in the\nimage of Telperion, elder of the Two Trees of Valinor, originally. This\nimage was given to the Elves of Kortirion in Valinor and named\nGalathilion. From it a sapling was taken to Tol Eressëa, named Celeborn.\nThis in turn sired the tree Nimloth of Númenor, felled by Sauron and\nburned on the altars. History First White Tree The first White Tree of\nGondor came from a fruit that Isildur, at great personal risk, managed\nto steal from Nimloth the Fair, the White Tree of Númenor, before that\none was destroyed at Sauron's insistence. He suffered many wounds at\nthis mission, and he came near death, but when the first leaf opened in\nthe spring, Isildur was healed of his wounds. This sapling was brought\nto Middle-earth on Isildur's ship, and it was eventually planted in\nMinas Ithil before the house of Isildur. But when Sauron returned to\nMiddle-earth, he launched a sudden attack that captured Minas Ithil, and\nhe destroyed the White Tree. Isildur escaped taking with him again a\nsapling. Second White Tree In the Year 2 of the Third Age, Isildur\nplants the seedling of the White Tree in Minas Anor. This White Tree\nlasts until TA 1636, when the Great Plague hits Gondor, killing among\nmany others King Telemnar and his children. Third White Tree A third\nsapling is planted in TA 1640 by King Tarondor. This one lasts until the\nyear 2852 and the death of the Ruling Steward Belecthor II. At this time\nno seedling of the tree could be found. As a result it was left standing\nafter its death. Fourth White Tree When Aragorn becomes king he\ndiscovers (with Gandalf's help) a sapling of the White Tree upon the\nslopes of Mindolluin, high above the city, which he reverently plants in\nits place. The dead tree is removed from the court but is placed in the\nTombs of the Kings with all the honour that would normally be accorded a\nfallen monarch. In June of TA 3019 the sapling blooms."

The land was known in part for\nits cold and snowy weather. History Long before the Witch-king came to\nAngmar, the dwarves had many flourishing mines in the region, and halls\nthat were secure and prosperous. It was not long before Durin's Folk\nfelt the first assaults of Angmar. They fled southward, seeking the\nsafety of their mines in the Weather Hills.  The Witch-king arose in\nAngmar during the realm of Malvegil of Arthedain, at some time between\nTA 1272 and TA 1349. Men became aware of the growing evil in the\nmountains, but Angmar was still preparing its power. No assaults on the\nDunedain came until Argeleb I, the son of Malvegil, assumed the throne\nof Arthedain.  In TA 1356, the sub-realm Rhudaur was forced to invade\nArthedain; many were slaughtered including their king, Argeleb I.\nHowever, with the help of Cardolan's armies, Arthedain maintained a\nstrong line of defense at the foot of the Weather Hills.  Then in TA\n1409, Angmar attacked Cardolan and Rivendell and destroyed all the\nsettlements within except Cardolan's capital, the Barrow-downs. Amon Sul\nwas razed and burned and the Dunedain were forced to flee westward.\nArthedain was now left without any allies to aid it, and so began a\nmighty struggle lasting another 500 years.   Help came from the Elves of\nthe Grey Havens, Rivendell, and Lorien. The armies of Angmar were\nrepelled from Fornost and the North Downs, and forced to withdraw to\nAngmar. The shadow of the North was contained for a time.   After the\nGreat Plague, which started from the east of Mordor in TA 1636, the last\nof Cardolan's people died, allowing Barrow-wights to be sent from\nAngmar into the downs.  During the time of TA 1974, Angmar multiplied\nits forces and launched a final assault on Arthedain.

    "text": "The EDAIN (sing. ADAN) also known as ATANATÁRI, FATHERS OF MEN, and_'\nThree Houses of Men_', are a group of Men that came to the Beleriand\nfrom the Far East during the First Age. History In the early fourth\ncentury of the First Age the Edain, drawn towards the Light of the West,\ncame into Beleriand where they befriended the elves, entered their\nservice, received land and title for that service, and fought valiantly\nin the Battles of Beleriand. Some, however, remained in Estolad or fled\nsouth or east from the power of Dark Lord Morgoth, and passed from\nhistory until the Third Age. Despite their mighty heroes, the Edain were\ndecimated by the hordes of Morgoth, but one of their numbers, Eärendil\nof the House of Hador, sailed to Aman and obtained from the Valar the\naid by which Morgoth was defeated in the Last Battle. The remnant of the\nEdain, now increased in body and mind by Eönwë, then sailed to Númenor\nand became known as Númenóreans and later the Dúnedain who came to live\nin Middle-earth in the Realms in Exile after the Fall of Númenor. Three\nHouses of Man They were divided into three tribes, or “Houses”: 1.) The\nHOUSE OF BËOR: they were dark-haired and stoutly built, and most\nresembled the Ñoldor of all Elves. They were first discovered by Finrod\nFelagund, Lord of Nargothrond, and under his guidance later made their\nway to the lands of the Ñoldorin lord Amrod, in a place later known as\nEstolad, the Encampment. They remained loyal to the House of Finarfin,\nand later settled in the lands of Dorthonion. 2.) The Second House,\nlater known as the HALADIN or the HOUSE OF HALETH: They were a reclusive\nfolk, dark-haired but smaller in stature than the Bëorians. They usually\nkept separate from the other Men, and were later granted permission to\nsettle in the Forest of Brethil, part of Doriath. They mostly kept out\nof the wars. 3.) The HOUSE OF MARACH, later best known as the HOUSE OF\nHADOR: They were originally led by Marach but later took the name of\nHador in honor of him. Tall and golden-haired, they most resembled the\nVanyar of the elves. They were a very numerous and war-like tribe, and\nthe Green Elves of Ossiriand feared them. They first settled in Estolad,\nthen in the southern parts of Ered Wethrin (Mountains of Shadow), and\nthen later in Dor-lómin. They were loyal to Fingolfin. Characteristics\nThe Edain were tall, fair, and strong; their spirits were noble, they\nwere fierce in war, and they shunned all dealings with evil. In\nBeleriand the Edain loved the Eldar, from whom they learned much wisdom,\nand they were further ennobled by the two marriages of Elda and Adan:\nBeren and Lúthien and Tuor and Idril. The lifespan of the Edain before\nthey entered Beleriand was probably about 70 years; in Beleriand, it was\nlengthened to 90, but few of the Edain lived to old age in peace.\nLanguage The language of the Edain (at least those of the First and\nThird Houses) was related to Adûnaic, but in Beleriand, most of the\nEdain spoke Sindarin, and so the tongue of the Haladin was alien to\nthem. Fate of the Edain The House of Bëor was nearly wiped out by\nMorgoth, and the remainder of its people merged with the Hadorians and\nbecame the Númenóreans. It would seem that the Haladin of Beleriand were\ncompletely wiped out, or at least disappeared as a separate people. When\nthey returned as Númenóreans to Middle-earth in the Second Age, they\nencountered many men who were obviously related to the Atani: they\nclassified these men as _Middle Men_, and established friendly relations\nwith them. Examples are the Rohirrim, the Men of Dale, and the\nBreelanders. Other men, such as the Dunlendings, were not recognised as\nMiddle Men because they were related to the Haladin rather than Bëorians\nor Marachians, and they were hostile to Númenor. A fourth kind of men\ncame with the Second House, and called themselves _Drughu_. This name\nwas adopted in Sindarin as _Drúedain_: _Drû_+_Edain_. They were a\nstrange people, living with the Haladin in the forest of Brethil, some\neven apparently made it to Númenor, but they died out or had left before\nthe Akallabêth. In the Third Age, their far kin were known as the\n_Woses_ of the Drúadan Forest. They had dwindled to a very small number\nand were secretive but were renowned for the assistance they gave to the\nRohirrim in the War of the Ring. Etymology The Sindarin word _Edain_,\nsingular _Adan_ (Quenya _Atani_, _Atan_), literally meant _Second\nPeople_, and originally referred to all men, but later it only applied\nto the Men of Beleriand and their descendants. The Quenya term _Atani_\nkept its old meaning."

    "text": "CARDOLAN was sub-kingdom of the Dúnedain Kingdom of Arnor. After the\ndeath of its tenth King, Eärendur, his sons had divided Arnor into the\nkingdoms of Arthedain, Rhudaur and Cardolan. History The borders of\nCardolan extended from the river Brandywine to the west, the river\nHoarwell to the east and the river Gwathló (Greyflood) to the east and\nsouth. Its northern border was the Great East Road, but Cardolan also\nclaimed the Arthedain-controlled Weather Hills, which contained the\nfortress of Weathertop and its valuable Palantír. For this reason the\nWeather Hills were claimed by all three kingdoms - Arthedain, Cardolan\nand Rhudaur. This territorial dispute continued until Rhudaur became a\nvassal of Angmar after the line of the Dúnedain kings failed there. When\nthe kingdom of Angmar arose in northern Eriador, Cardolan became the\nmost important ally of Arthedain. It had to fight the combined armies of\nboth Angmar and Rhudaur. It soon became apparent that Cardolan could not\nhold back the forces of Angmar and in its last years the people became\nentrenched in the hill region, Tyrn Gorthad (the Barrowdowns). This\nposition became untenable after Angmar sent evil spirits to inhabit the\ndowns (the Barrow-wights). Arthedain could provide little aid, as it was\nitself under attack. Around TA 1409 Cardolan was destroyed, and its\nformer inhabitants accepted the King of Arthedain as their lord.\nArthedain managed to reconquer the land briefly, but few people wished\nto live there on account of the Barrow-wights, and so Cardolan was never\nre-populated. After the final fall of Arnor, and the destruction of\nAngmar at the Battle of Fornost, Cardolan remained an unpopulated area\nuntil the reestablishment of the northern kingdom under King Aragorn II\nElessar at the end of the Third Age. Until then, the region was largely\nunclaimed and known as Minhiriath. Etymology The name _Cardolan_ appears\nto be a dialect Sindarin word for 'Red Hill Land'.",

History During the reign\nof Eärendur his sons were in open discord, which erupted into civil war\nafter Eärendur's death in TA 861. Amlaith, the true heir to the throne\nof Arnor, was opposed by his two brothers. Unable to resolve the\nsituation, he was reduced to ruling the region of Arthedain, which\nconsisted approximately of the lands west of the Brandywine River and\nnorth of the Great East Road. (His brothers created the kingdoms of\nCardolan and Rhudaur to the south.) The kingdom's capital was at\nFornost, and Bree was one of its most important towns. Annúminas was in\nthe territory of Arthedain, but mostly abandoned and falling into ruin.\nIn TA 1300 the kingdom of Angmar appeared at Arthedain's north-eastern\nborder. Its King was the chief of the Ringwraiths, although this was not\nknown to the Dúnedain. When this new threat came Cardolan placed itself\nunder the suzerainty of Arthedain, which then began to call itself ARNOR\nagain. Cardolan repeatedly sent aid to Arthedain when needed but by TA\n1409 Cardolan and Rhudaur were conquered by Angmar. Arthedain kept up\nthe resistance against Angmar for over 500 years but in TA 1974\nArthedain was overrun and Fornost fell into the hands of Angmar. It fell\njust one year too soon for help was underway from Gondor under the lead\nof Eärnur. This army reached Arthedain in TA 1975 and destroyed Angmar\nat the Battle of Fornost. Its last King, Arvedui, drowned just before\nthe battle was fought. The kings of Arthedain were also the lords of The\nShire and the Shire chose the Thain to replace the kings. The son of\nArvedui, Aranarth decided not to rebuild the kingdom and so became the\nfirst Chieftain of the Dúnedain.

    "text": "THE SHIRE is subdivided into several regions. Farthings The original\nparts of the Shire were subdivided into four FARTHINGS (“fourth-ings” or\n“quarterings”): the Three-Farthing stone marked the point where the\nborders of the Eastfarthing, Westfarthing and Southfarthing of the Shire\ncame together, by the Great East Road. The Northfarthing The\nNorthfarthing is the least populated part of the Shire. This was the\nsite of the historic Battle of Greenfields. - LONG CLEEVE was the home\nof the small part of the Took clan known as the _North-Tooks_,\ndescendants of Bandobras “Bullroarer” Took, who settled here after the\nBattle of Greenfields.   - The village of HARDBOTTLE was the home to the\nBracegirdle family of Hobbits, to whom Lobelia Sackville-Baggins\nbelonged. Some maps erroneously place Hardbottle in the Southfarthing.\nThe Westfarthing The western and most populated part of the Shire, this\nis the site of the towns Michel Delving, Tuckborough (part of\nTook-land), and Hobbiton. - MICHEL DELVING is the chief town of the\nShire, located in the White Downs. Its name means simply “large\nexcavation”. The Mayor of Michel Delving is the only elected official of\nThe Shire, elected on a seven year term.   - HOBBITON is the village\nwhere Bag End is located. This is the home of Bilbo Baggins and Frodo\nBaggins and the site of the beginning and conclusion of the novels _The\nHobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_. Sam Gamgee and his grandfather, the\n“Gaffer”, live on the lane of _Bagshot Row_, below Bag End.   - Bywater\nis a village a short walk east of Hobbiton. It is best known as the home\nof two inns, The Green Dragon Inn and The Ivy Bush. The Southfarthing A\nrural and fertile area, the Southfarthing is the site of the towns\nGamwich (original home of the Gamgee family), Cotton, Longbottom and\nmuch pipe-weed production. - LONGBOTTOM, a name meaning “long valley”,\nwas founded by Tobold Hornblower with the introduction of pipe-weed, in\nTA 2670, allowing the region to become well established due to the\nsuccess of the pipe-weed industry. The Eastfarthing Borders on Buckland,\ncontains the towns Frogmorton and Whitfurrows and the farms of the\nMarish. Originally, the Eastfarthing was under the control of the\nOldbuck family. Even after these became the Brandybucks, the farmers of\nthe Eastfarthing followed the Brandybucks rather than the Thain and\nMayor. - THE YALE is the name of the low-lying lands of the Shire's\nEastfarthing that lay along the northern side of the long road from\nStock westwards to Tuckborough. This seems to have been a sparsely\npopulated area, and in fact the map of the Shire in _The Lord of the\nRings_ marks only a single building here. - The meaning of the Yale's\nname is obscure. The well-known English personal and placename “Yale”\nhas its origins in a Welsh expression meaning “fertile upland.” Its use\nmay suggest that the Hobbits who named it had contacts with “strange”\nlanguages, possibly those of Dunland.   - THE MARISH is the name of\nfertile, yet boggy farmlands located in the Shire's Eastfarthing. It is\nwhere the Oldbuck family is believed to have lived before Gorhendad\nOldbuck removed the family across the Brandywine to Buckland and changed\ntheir name Other parts of the Shire The Buckland and Westmarch are\nsometimes reckoned part of the Shire, though they are not part of any\nFarthing. Buckland was described in Chapter V _A conspiracy unmasked_ in\nFellowship of the Ring as being _“virtually a small independent\ncountry.. a sort of colony of the Shire.”_ Westmarch became part of the\nShire only after the end of the events portrayed in Lord of the Rings,\nin the fourth age. Buckland Location, villages and borders Buckland is\nlocated east of the Baranduin (Brandywine) river. The hobbits living in\nBuckland grew the High Hay, a hedge, to protect themselves against evil\nfrom the nearby Old Forest, which borders Buckland to the east. Buckland\nis bordered in the north by the Hay Gate, the only entrance to Buckland\nnear the Brandywine Bridge. In the south the borders of Buckland follow\nthe High Hay until the Withywindle joins the Baranduin near the village\nof Haysend. The most important town of Buckland is _BUCKLEBURY_ where\nthe Brandy Hall is located, home of the Master of Buckland, one of the\nimportant officials of the Shire. An important landmark is the\n_BUCKLEBURY FERRY_, a raft-ferry used as the second main crossing point\nof the Brandywine River from the Shire to Buckland, after the Brandywine\nBridge (which is twenty miles further south). It is apparently left\nunmanned to be used by hobbit travellers as needed. En route to the new\nhouse at Crickhollow, Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin crossed using the\nFerry just before the arrival of a Black Rider, who was forced to go\naround to the Brandywine Bridge as there were no boats kept on the\nwestern bank of the river. History and Culture Buckland was settled\naround TA 2340 by Gorhenhad Oldbuck, the ancestor of Meriadoc\nBrandybuck. Gorhenhad Oldbuck thus became the first Master of Buckland.\nHe renamed himself Brandybuck, which remained his family's name. Because\nBuckland is east of the Baranduin it isn't part of the land given to the\nHobbits by King Argeleb II of Arthedain. It was thus not part of the\nShire proper until the beginning of the Fourth Age when King Elessar\nmade Buckland and the Westmarch officially a part of the Shire. The\nBucklanders are unlike other hobbits as they are prepared for danger and\nare thus less naive than the Shire-hobbits. They close the Hay Gate and\ntheir own front doors at night and are prepared to rush to arms when the\nHorn of Buckland is blown. Most Bucklanders were originally of Stoor\nstock, and they were the only Hobbits known to use boats. The Westmarch\nAfter the events of the War of the Ring at the start of the Fourth Age\nof Middle-earth, King Aragorn Elessar granted the Hobbits of the Shire\neffective self-rule inside his Reunited Kingdom, banning any men from\nentering the land. He also granted the Shire a stretch of new land: this\nreached from the ancient western borders of the Shire, the White Downs,\nto the Tower Hills. The area between the downs and the hills became\nknown as the WESTMARCH. The eldest daughter of mayor Samwise Gamgee,\nElanor the Fair, married Fastred of Greenholm, and they moved to the\nWestmarch. After the passing of master Samwise, they and their children\nbecame known as the _Fairbairns of the Towers_ or _Wardens of\nWestmarch_, and the Red Book of Frodo and Bilbo Baggins passed into\ntheir keeping, becoming known as the _Red Book of Westmarch_.\nGovernmentally, the Westmarch was a region of itself, and like Buckland\nacross the river Brandywine it was not part of any of the four Farthings\nof the Shire.

    "text": "RHUDAUR was the smallest of the kingdoms that originated from the\nbreak-up of Arnor in TA 861. The other kingdoms were Arthedain and\nCardolan. History Rhudaur formed the eastern part of Arnor, and\nstretched from the Weather Hills with Weathertop to the river Loudwater.\nIt shared a long border with Cardolan along the Great East Road, and\nwith Arthedain along the line of the Weather Hills. The land between the\nrivers Hoarwell and Loudwater was also considered part of Rhudaur. It\nwas called _the Angle_, and it is here that the first Stoor Hobbits came\ninto Eriador around TA 1150. However, due to the increasing hostility of\nAngmar these Stoors fled the region around TA 1356, with some of them\nmoving west to the Shire, and others moving back to Wilderland. From the\nstart of its existence, Rhudaur was unfriendly towards the two other\nsuccessor states, and took part in a bitter conflict with Arthedain over\nthe Tower of Amon Sûl and the Palantír associated with the tower. The\nlast Kings of Rhudaur were not of Númenórean blood, but were descended\nof Men in service of Angmar. Under their rule the land became a vassal\nof Angmar, and thus enemies of Cardolan and Arthedain. Angmar annexed\nand terminated the kingdom in TA 1409. By this time, the Dúnedain were\ngone from the region, as well as most of the other inhabitants. There is\nevidence that after the fall of Angmar at the Battle of Fornost the\nAngle became home to the remainder of the Dúnedain, and the Rangers of\nthe North established several villages there, where their people lived\nuntil the resurrection of the northern Kingdom under King Aragorn II\nElessar at the end of the Third Age. Etymology The _Haeranedain_ (S.“Far\nWandering Edain”) were Rhudaurians of Númenorean descent, most were\nactually mix-blooded Tergil. Most Rhudaurian Dúnedain belonged to one of\nseven greater Noble Houses of Hiri, House Amrothar, House Eldanar, House\nEnedil, House Melosse, House Mithlad, House Rhudainor and House\nRómentir. The name Rhudaur appears to be dialect Sindarin for 'East\nForests', The _Rhudaurians_ (S.“Rhudaurim”) were the inhabitants of the\nfallen kingdom of Rhudaur, in the closer sense those of númenorean\nblood, the Haeranedain, in a wider sense all those eriadorian tribes\nliving inside the borders of Rhudaur including: - the Hillmen of the\nTrollshaws and Coldfells - the Vulseggi or northrons of the Egladil -\nthe Dunmen of the southern borderlands to Eregion and Cardolan - the\nForodrim of the Northern marches Appearance The Haeranedain were a bit\nsmaller and darker than the high Dúnedain, although 6 ft for men was not\nuncommon. In daily life most had adapted clothes much similar to those\nof the indigenous Hillmen, the _Kailth_, a skirt or kilt, and the\n_Kullodoo_.",

Beren was now the last person of the house\nof Bëor but in the Second Age some families of Númenor still\nspoke Adûnaic with a notable Bëorian accent. Furthermore, the majority\nof faithful were those of Bëorian descent. This was because the majority\nof the Men of Bëor had settled in the western part of Númenor, which\nlater became the area controlled by the faithful Lords of Andúnië.\nTraits of the House of Bëor were passed down to the Dúnedain of the\nMiddle-earth and can be seen in Aragorn II Elessar's physical\ndescription: lean, dark and tall, with “a shaggy head of dark hair\nflecked with grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keen grey eyes.”\nNotable members - BËOR THE OLD, originally named Balan and later given\nthe title _the Old_, was leader of the House of Bëor, the first men to\ntravel into Beleriand.

He dwelt in Estolad and had two sons, BORON and\nBARANOR.   - BEREG, a grandson of Baran, was dissatisfied with Estolad,\nand led part of the people away to parts unknown, disappearing from the\nhistories.

    "text": "NARGOTHROND (Sindarin IPA: ) was the Elven stronghold built by Finrod\nFelagund, delved into the banks of the river Narog in Beleriand during\nthe First Age. Description Similar to the structures of many underground\nDwarven cities, Nargothrond consisted of many miles of caves and tunnels\nof various shapes and sizes carved through the rock, which was possibly\nlimestone. There were three Great Halls centered around the other\ntunnels and caves, where the Lord of the city no doubt sat. The deepest\nof the caves was the Innermost Chamber where Glaurung later hoarded up\nthe remaining treasures of Nargothrond and sat upon them until he left.\nLúthien lived in a southwestern cave chamber during her stay there. The\nrealms armouries were in several chambers south of the Great Halls. The\nmain entrance through the Doors of Felagund to Nargothrond facing river\nNarog one came into a large chamber, which was about five-hundred feet\nfrom the Great Halls of Felagund. History Years of Peace Inspired by\nMenegroth in Doriath, and seeking a hidden place from which to be safe\nfrom the forces of Morgoth, Finrod established it in the early years\nfollowing the return of the Ñoldor to Middle-earth, in the Caverns of\nNarog beneath the forested hills of TAUR-EN-FAROTH on the western bank\nof Narog. He was aided by the Dwarves of Nogrod who also made for him\nthe Nauglamír, the Necklace of the Dwarves. However, Finrod was not the\nfirst to delve in those caves: it had first been inhabited by the\nPetty-dwarves, who called it NULUKKIZDÎN (Khuzdul IPA: ) before they\nwere driven out. Originally, a narrow path along the banks of the river\ncould only reach it, but later a bridge was built across the Narog.\nFinrod ruled Nargothrond until he joined Beren in his Quest for the\nSilmaril, being succeeded by his nephew Orodreth. However, the Sons of\nFëanor, Celegorm and Curufin lived in Nargothrond at this time and\ncarried a great influence with its people, sowing fear and distrust of\noutsiders. After Finrod's death was reported they were exiled in\ndisgrace. Fall of Nargothrond [Túrin and Glaurung, by woutart Since its\nfoundation by Finrod, the Elves of Nargothrond had pursued a secretive\nwar against Morgoth, hunting his forces by stealth and ambush rather\nthan going to open war. When Túrin was led there by Gwindor, however, he\ngrew high in the esteem of Orodreth, Lord of Nargothrond, and counseled\na different strategy. Túrin Turambar became one of the chief captains,\npersuading the people to abandon their long standing policy and instead\nfight openly against Morgoth. Túrin persuaded Orodreth to build the\nBridge of Nargothrond to allow speedy passage of forces into the field.\nOrodreth built the bridge from his doors across the Narog, and went to\nopen war with Morgoth. In centuries of searching, Morgoth had been\nunable to find the fortress of Nargothrond, but now not only was its\nlocation revealed, but the new bridge removed the defence of the River\nNarog. Glaurung the dragon was sent out from Angband with an army of\nOrcs to capture the city. After the defeat of the army of Nargothrond at\nthe field of Tumhalad in FA 495, Glaurung and his army of Orcs came\nsouth, crossed the bridge, and sacked the city, killing or selling some\nof the inhabitants into slavery. The survivors, then went to seek refuge\nin Doriath, and that's how Thingol knew of the fall of Nargothrond.\nGlaurung remained there until FA 499 when he went northeast to Brethil,\nto confront Túrin Turambar who eventually slew him. Though the realm was\nno more, Mîm the Petty-dwarf took up residence in caves claiming it and\nits treasures as his own in payment for the sufferings of his people,\nuntil Húrin came and slew him for his betrayal of his son. The treasure,\nincluding the Nauglamír, was then brought to the Elven Kingdom of\nDoriath and given to King Thingol. Afterwards, the caves were destroyed\nduring the War of Wrath, along with all of Beleriand. Etymology\n_NARGOTHROND_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Narog-fortress-vaulted\nhall'.",

Description Dorthonion was 60 leagues east to west. In the\nnorth, it rose gradually from the plains, with great pine forests. The\nEred Gorgoroth formed the southern boundary of Dorthonion, bending to\nthe north on the east side to create the PASS OF AGLON between\nDorthonion and Hills of Himring. To the south and west of Dorthonion\nwere the Echoriath, which surrounded the hidden kingdom of Gondolin. The\nupper reaches of the River Sirion passed between the western slopes of\nDorthonion and the Ered Wethrin. History Dorthonion was originally ruled\nby Angrod and Aegnor, sons of Finarfin, but it was overrun by Morgoth in\nthe Dagor Bragollach, after which it was known as Taur-nu-Fuin which\ntranslates as _Forest under Night_ or _The Forest under the Shadow of\nthe Night_. The northeastern slopes of Dorthonion were known as Ladros,\na fief given to Boromir of the House of Bëor. Here Barahir and a small\nband of outlaws dwelt until they were all slain at Tarn Aeluin by Orcs\nsent by Sauron save for Beren, Barahir's son in FA 460. Beren dwelt\nalone in the wilderness of Dorthonion for a time until he left for\nDoriath and met Lúthien. Along with the other lands west of the Blue\nMountains, Taur-nu-Fuin was mostly destroyed in the War of Wrath at the\nend of the First Age. Afterwards, its highest points survived as the\nisland TOL FUIN (Isle of Night), part of the WESTERN ISLES. Etymology\n_DORTHONION_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'land of pines'."

Although it was colonized by\nShire-hobbits, it was not formally a part of the Shire until early in\nthe Fourth Age, hundreds of years after it was founded. Location,\nVillages and Borders Buckland is located east of the Brandywine river.\nThe hobbits living in Buckland grew the High Hay, a hedge, to protect\nthemselves against any evil from the nearby Old Forest, which borders\nBuckland to the east. Buckland is bordered in the north by the Hay Gate,\nthe only entrance to Buckland near the Brandywine Bridge. In the south,\nthe borders of Buckland follow the High Hay until the Withywindle joins\nthe Brandywine near the village of Haysend. The most important town of\nBuckland is _BUCKLEBURY_ where Brandy Hall is located, home of the\nMaster of Buckland, one of the important officials of the Shire. An\nimportant landmark is the _BUCKLEBURY FERRY_, a raft-ferry used as the\nsecond main crossing point of the Brandwine river from the Shire to\nBuckland, after the Brandywine Bridge (which is twenty miles further\nnorth). It is apparently left unmanned to be used by hobbit travellers\nas needed. En route to the new house at Crickhollow, Frodo Baggins, Sam\nGamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took crossed using the Ferry\njust before the arrival of a Black Rider, who was forced to go around to\nthe Brandywine Bridge as there were no boats kept on the western bank of\nthe river. History Buckland was settled around TA 2340 (SR 740) by\nGorhendad Oldbuck, the ancestor of Meriadoc Brandybuck. Gorhenhad\nOldbuck thus became the first Master of Buckland. He renamed himself\nBrandybuck, which remained his family's name. Because Buckland is east\nof the Brandywine, it isn't part of the land given to the Hobbits by\nKing Argeleb II of Arthedain. It was thus not part of the Shire proper\nuntil the beginning of the Fourth Age when King Elessar made Buckland,\nnow renamed the EASTMARCH, and the Westmarch official parts of the\nShire. Culture The Bucklanders are unlike other hobbits as they are\nprepared for danger and are thus less naive than the Shire-hobbits. They\nclose the Hay Gate and their own front doors at night and are prepared\nto rush to arms when the Horn of Buckland is blown. Most Bucklanders\nwere originally of Stoor stock, and they were the only Hobbits known to\nuse boats."

After the fall of Doriath the Haladin were nearly\ncompletely wiped out, or at least they had disappeared as a separate\npeople.

The river formed the eastern border of the\nKingdom of Arnor and later the petty-realm of Rhudaur. South of it\nlies Eregion (Hollin). The southern arm of the Bruinen flows through the\ndeep valley where Elrond founded the elven village of _Imladris_ or\nRivendell.

Translated into English, it reads, “_Sting_ is my name; I am the\nspider's bane.” The Appendix of ''The Silmarillion _defines_ _the\nelement _maeg'' in Sindarin as meaning “sharp” or “piercing”. During the\nThird Age, it was wielded by Bilbo Baggins, Frodo Baggins, and Samwise\nGamgee. History Sting was an ancient Elvish blade made by weapon-smiths\nin Gondolin. When Orcs or goblins were within an undetermined radius of\nit, the blade glowed blue, alerting the wielder and others who could see\nit to their presence. It had been lost during the Fall of Gondolin, the\nsame battle in which Turgon fell and Glamdring was taken. It appeared as\na curved blade with a silver loop or spiral design on it, later runes\nwere added to it by Bilbo after his adventures. These runes seem to have\nbeen made by the Elves as they are in Sindarin. In _The Hobbit_, Bilbo\nand his dwarven companions found Sting in a Troll-hoard alongside two\nother elven blades: Glamdring and Orcrist. Though just a dagger by the\nstandard of elves, Sting made a perfect short sword for a Hobbit,\nalthough it was still rather small, as Bilbo initially chose to wear it\n“inside his breeches” and was still able to travel and even run without\nany apparent inconvenience. Just before his nephew embarked on his quest\nto Mordor from Rivendell, Bilbo gave Sting to Frodo. Sam then took the\nweapon from his (seemingly dead) master and used it to good effect\nagainst Shelob on the borders of Mordor. After the defeat of Sauron at\nthe end of the Third Age, Frodo entrusted Sting to Sam and it became an\nheirloom of the Gamgee family. Gollum, who disliked anything made by the\nElves, was afraid of Sting. This fear aided Bilbo when he confronted\nGollum in the Cave at the base of the Misty Mountains in _The Hobbit_.\nIt also helped Frodo and Sam subdue Gollum in _The Lord of the Rings_.\nOrcs also had an instinctive fear of these weapons and hated any who\ncarried them. As is fitting for a blade of Gondolin, Sting could easily\ncut through the webs of the offspring of Ungoliant, including the evil\nShelob and the spiders of Mirkwood. Bilbo had named the weapon _Sting_\nafter he had “stung” one of them with it. In The Hobbit when Bilbo wears\nthe One Ring, and defends himself against a spider, he names the blade\n“Sting”. The narrator describes the spider's lack of acquaintance with\ncreatures with such stings, and evidently this was also Bilbo's\npresumption in naming it as such. Sting was like Glamdring and Orcrist\nin that “being the work of Elvish smiths in the Elder Days these swords\nshone with a cold light, if any Orcs were near at hand.” But only Sting\nwas definitively described as glowing blue, or glittering with blue\nflame at its edges.",

    "text": "The GREAT EAST ROAD stretched from the Grey Havens, through the Shire\nand Bree to Rivendell, and eastward over the Misty Mountains even\nthrough Mirkwood. History The Great East Road was originally laid by the\nDwarves during the First Age before the first rising of the Sun, and ran\nfrom the Iron Hills through Rhovanion to Khazad-dûm, from which it\ncontinued across Eriador to the Blue Mountains, and then on into Doriath\nin Beleriand. The western parts were built to facilitate the passage of\ncompanies of Dwarf craftsmen (and later, their armed escort) across\neastern Beleriand, before the Sack of Doriath by the dwarfs of Nogrod\nended their trade. First Age After the First Age, and the ruination of\nNogrod and neighbouring Belegost, focus shifted to the eastern part of\nthe ancient road, which had been built by the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm in\nthe Misty Mountains. Khazad-dûm's inhabitants, the Longbeard dwarves,\ncontinued to grow in power and influence, and their trading needs meant\nthat the road from the Iron Hills that traveled through Mirkwood to\ntheir gates became widely known. On the western side of the Misty\nMountains, after traversing the High Pass, the road continued to the\nBlue Mountains, and this part ultimately became known as the\nMEN-I-NAUGRIMOR (“Old Dwarf Road”). When the Númenórean realm in exile\nof Arnor was founded, the Arnorians took over the maintenance of the\nMen-i-Naugrim, and built several fortresses on or near it (including\nWeathertop), and expanded or created bridges over the rivers Brandywine\nand Mitheithel. After Arnor was divided in TA 861, the Great East Road\nformed the boundary between two of its successor states, Cardolan and\nRhudaur. Third Age By the time of the War of the Ring in the late Third\nAge, where the Great East Road met the Greenway lay the ancient village\nof Bree. A days ride east lay The Forsaken Inn, beyond which lay\nRivendell. West of the crossroads the hobbits had colonized the Shire,\nand their most important towns lay athwart the East Road; (Hobbiton and\nMichel Delving to name two). Aftermath After the War of the Ring,\nsections of the road that ran through the Shire would have been\noff-limits to Men, under a proclamation of King Elessar.",

    "text": "The BATTLE OF THE BLACK GATE, also known as the BATTLE OF THE\nMORANNON, was the final major battle of the War of the Ring. It resulted\nin the ultimate defeat of Sauron not by victory on the battlefield, but\nby means of the destruction of the One Ring by the hobbit Frodo. History\nBackground After the victory of the Free Peoples in the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields, the enemy retreated to Mordor. Sauron was defeated but\nhe still had thousands of Orcs at his disposal in Mordor. He was aware\nthat the One Ring was somewhat close to the vicinity of his territory,\nbut he did not know that the Hobbit Frodo Baggins and his companion\nSamwise Gamgee had entered Mordor via Morgul Vale with the intention of\ndestroying the Ring. Plot against the Dark Lord After the Last Debate,\nthe Men of the West assembled the Host of the West, 10,000 strong, led\nby Aragorn, who marched on the Black Gate as a diversionary feint to\ndistract Sauron's attention from Frodo and Sam, who were carrying the\nOne Ring through Mordor to be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom. It\nwas hoped that Sauron would think Aragorn had the Ring and was now\ntrying to use it to overthrow him in Mordor. Mustering Initially, the\nHost of the West consisted of 10,000 men, but 3,000 Rohirrim were sent\nto guard the crossroads, leaving Aragorn with 7,000 men. Before they\nreached Ithilien they were ambushed by Haradrim and Easterlings, but\nthey drove them away easily with no casualties. Then, as they approached\nDagorlad, some of the farmers of Lossarnach and Rohan were too afraid to\ncontinue to pass the Desolation of the Morannon. Aragorn dismissed the\nfaint-hearted, ordering them to liberate Cair Andros on the river\nAnduin. This resulted in the departure of an estimated 1000 men, leaving\nAragorn with 6,000. Parley with the Dark Lieutenant Before the battle\nbegan, the Black Gate opened slightly, letting out a small embassy. At\nthe head was a high servant of Sauron, a Black Númenórean called the\nMouth of Sauron, who had been ordered to speak with the Captains of the\nWest. He reasoned that the Army of the West could not defeat Sauron's\nhost on the battlefield, and demanded the Army surrender. The Lieutenant\nthen brought forth several items that had belonged to Frodo and Sam\n(Sam's sword, an Elven cloak, and Frodo's Mithril shirt). Gandalf asked\nfor the terms of their surrender, which were to allow Sauron dominion\nover Isengard and Rohan, as well as Gondor's vassalage. Gandalf\nvehemently refused. Realizing the Army intended to fight and being\noutnumbered, fear and anger overcame the Lieutenant, and he retreated to\nthe Morannon, which then opened to reveal a massive army of Sauron's\nforces. Thousands of Orcs also emerged from the hillsides around the\nMorannon. In the film Aragorn, not believing what happened to Frodo,\nbeheads The Mouth of Sauron. The Battle Against the Host of the West was\narrayed a large hordes of Orcs, Trolls, and Mannish allies such as the\nEasterlings and Haradrim. An exact count is not given of the number of\nSauron's forces, but it is said that they were “ten times and more than\nten times” greater than the Host of the West, making it a force of at\nleast 60,000. Sauron's forces surrounded the Armies of the West on three\nsides, with the Easterlings on the left flank, the Orcs held the center,\nand the Haradrim on the right. Initially, Sauron's forces found\ndifficulty in getting to the Army of the West, due to the large slag\npools and pits of waste surrounding parts of the Morannon, which impeded\ntheir progress. The Armies of the West always had cohesive stability\nwithin their center and kept the Enemy from breaking through by force of\nnumbers. The solid infantry squares of Gondor infantry beat off their\ninferior Orcish opponents while the Rohirrim cavalrymen staved off the\narchers of the Harad. The small force of Easterlings launched a quick\nattack before being repulsed by the armies of Gondor and Rohirrim while\nthe larger Haradrim force slowly retreated to the hills. By now,\npressure had eased off of the flanks of the Armies of the West, who\nsmashed into the lines of the Orc-host, slowly beating them off and\nforcing a retreat back through the Black Gate (though not without\nsuffering sizable losses of their own). During the course of the battle,\nthe remaining eight Nazgûl emerged and attacked the Army of the West.\nShortly thereafter, however, the Great Eagles of the Misty Mountains,\nled by Gwaihir the Windlord, arrived and attacked the Ringwraiths,\npreventing them from pressing their aerial advantage. Trolls began to\ncrash through the lines of infantry, and the Orcs and Easterlings made\nrenewed assaults on the Army of the West, encircling it. Many of the\nsoldiers of the West began to become distraught. That was when Frodo put\non the One Ring and Sauron realized that Frodo and the Ring were inside\nMount Doom. The Fall of Barad-dûr and Sauron The Nazgûl immediately left\nthe battle to intercept Frodo. Before they could get there however,\nGollum bit the Ring off Frodo's finger and danced with joy accidentally\nfalling into the Crack of Doom, destroying the Ring, and Sauron's power\nwas overthrown. Barad-dûr, the Black Gate, and the Towers of the Teeth\ncollapsed to ruin. The Orcs and other creatures of Sauron were\ncompletely directionless with the Dark Lord's demise and were easily\ndefeated and destroyed by the remaining troops of the Host of the West.\nSome of the Easterlings and Haradrim fought on stalwartly, though\neventually many threw down their weapons and surrendered (later to be\nsent home in peace by Aragorn). The Rest of the Battle Despite the\ndestruction of Mordor and its armies, the fight against Sauron's\nremaining forces would continue in the northern theater of the War of\nthe Ring for several weeks, notably at Dol Guldur in Mirkwood and at The\nLonely Mountain, but the power of Sauron, the Dark Lord of Mordor, was\nno more. Months later, the Battle of Bywater in the Shire against\nRuffians men led by Saruman, and the subsequent killing of Saruman by\nWormtongue who then was later slain, ended the War of the Ring.",

    "title": "Battle of Osgiliath",
    "page_id": "746",
    "text": "The BATTLE OF OSGILIATH was a battle during the War of the Ring at the\nruined city of Osgiliath - and a prelude to the Battle of the Pelennor\nFields. History Prelude Prior to this, Sauron had regained all his\nmilitary strength and was prepared to attack Middle-earth. He first\nplanned to attack his most powerful enemy, the land of Gondor, where\n“the hammer stroke will fall hardest”, but in order to destroy Gondor's\ncapital, Minas Tirith, he first needed to capture Osgiliath, a ruined\nfortress-city strategically positioned on the river. Fords across the\nriver were located in Osgiliath (half of the city was located on each\nside of the river) that were the only path a large army could cross the\nAnduin for hundreds of miles up or downstream (from Cair Andros to\nPelargir). If captured, Sauron could freely move his main army across\nthe river and to the primary target of his strategy in the war, Minas\nTirith. The Battle The battle to control the ruins of Osgiliath had\nactually been fought, on and off, for over a century since the fall of\nIthilien to Mordor. A renewed offensive by Mordor to take the city had\nbegun several years prior to the Quest of Mount Doom (several years\nbefore TA 3018), and was fought continuously after that point with\noccasional lulls. The forces of Gondor, led by their captain-general\nBoromir, engaged in fierce urban warfare during this long siege. Under\nBoromir's command the enemy was pushed out of the half of the city on\nthe west bank of the river, and on a strike force including Boromir and\nhis younger brother Faramir was able to destroy the last bridge in the\ncity that connected the two banks of the river. This prevented Mordor's\narmy from making an easy crossing, although the fords remained. Sauron\nnot sending more troops to Osgiliath, but instead massing them within\nMordor for a killing-blow months later probably caused this lull in the\nMordor-offensive. During this break in heavy fighting, Boromir left\nGondor to seek counsel at Rivendell; he would never return. During this\ntime, Faramir led several Ranger attacks deep into Mordor-occupied\nIthilien, ambushing enemy armies moving to the Black Gate; Frodo and Sam\nstumbled into one such attack, as told in _The Two Towers._ When the\nGreat Signal from Mordor went up and another answered from Minas Morgul,\nthe War of the Ring properly began, even though Isengard had been\nfighting before this and Sauron had been pursuing his other fronts.\nThus, the Battle of Osgiliath was the first battle of the war in a\nstrict sense. While there were men defending the west side of Osgiliath,\nthe Steward Denethor ordered Faramir to lead a force to reinforce them.\nFaramir regarded the order ill advised and certain to result in death,\nbut complied. However, Mordor was prepared. Months beforehand, the Orcs\nin East Osgiliath had been secretly constructing massive numbers of\nboats and rafts, and swelled with reinforcements from Harad they swarmed\nacross the River Anduin to the Gondor positions on the other bank. After\nlong and heavy fighting, the garrison under Faramir and his troops were\nforced to flee back to Minas Tirith, behind the Rammas Echor. Faramir\nhimself was badly wounded in the retreat, when a poisoned Southron arrow\npierced him; more severe damage was done by the Black breath of the\nNazgûl. When the retreat was sure to be a disaster, the knights of the\nDol Amroth sortie led by Imrahil arrived; the pursuing hordes were\ndriven back and the garrison reached the city safely. In the meantime,\nthe Orcs made makeshift repairs to several destroyed bridges. The main\ncombined army of Mordor then arrived, formed from those that Frodo saw\nleaving Minas Morgul, but this was “but one and not the greatest of the\nhosts that Mordor now sent forth”: for on their way from The Morgul\nVale, the orcs the Minas Morgul cavalry led by the Witch-king of Angmar\nhad been joined with the Haradrim from the south, and a far greater host\nthat had massed at the Black Gate joined them at Osgiliath, and the\ncombined forces now entered the western bank of Osgiliath. More also\ncame from the fords at Cair Andros, which was recently captured, but\nthey would not reach Minas Tirith until later. Aftermath Osigiliath now\ncompletely in the hands of Mordor, the vast army of Sauron marched from\nthe city and surrounded Minas Tirith, beginning the siege of Gondor and\nleading directly into the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.",

    "title": "Battle of Isengard",
    "page_id": "745",
    "text": "The BATTLE OF ISENGARD was described as an assault launched by a large\ngroup of Ents and Huorns. Persuaded by Treebeard to take action, they\nattacked Isengard and liberated the fortress, although they could not\nbring down Orthanc. It wasn't very well protected, as all the Uruk-hai\nhad been sent to Rohan, leaving only weak Orcs behind. Treebeard tore\ndown the gates of Isengard as many Orcs fled and were killed by the many\nHuorns now surrounding Isengard. Saruman was on the grounds when the\nattack began and retreated to Orthanc, almost caught by the Ent,\nQuickbeam. Once Saruman was inside he started up the machinery housed\nunderground, with several Ents scorched by the fumes and fires that\nerupted. Treebeard then calmed the enraged Ents and put them to work on\ntearing down the dam, releasing the river and cleansing Isengard of\nSaruman's treachery. History Background After a three day long Entmoot,\nan army of Ents and Huorn set off for the tower-fortress of Isengard,\nmaking a terrifying racket. They arrived and began their attack on March\n2. The time of their assault was fortunate, because they arrived just\nwhen the wizard Saruman was emptying Isengard for a final assault on\nRohan. As a result, there were few left to defend Isengard besides\nSaruman himself. Once the army of Isengard had left for Rohan, the Ents\nlaunched their attack on the walls. Attempts were made to hinder them\nwith arrows, but these only served to irritate the attackers further,\nand, in a matter of minutes the Gate and much of the Southern wall was\nreduced to ruin. The Battle As the Hobbits Merry and Pippin, who were\npresent during the battle, later recounted to their friends, Ents are so\nstrong that their _punches can crumple iron like tinfoil_, and they can\n_tear apart solid rock like breadcrusts._ A ring of Huorns surrounded\nIsengard and killed all escaping Orcs. Once the Gate and walls had been\nreduced to rubble, a young Ent named Quickbeam in the Westron tongue,\nspotted Saruman, and made for him, shouting 'The Tree Killer!', for his\npeople and all Fangorn forest in general had suffered from heavy\ndeforestation to fuel the furnaces of Saruman. Other Ents followed him,\nbut Saruman succeeded in escaping into the tower of Orthanc. Once in the\ntower, he activated spouts and vents all over the plain, scorching many\nEnts who had entered the fortress. One Ent, Beechbone, was unlucky\nenough to be caught fully in one of the fiery blasts, and the death of\nthis Ent by Saruman's fire caused the Ent host to go berserk. Merry and\nPippin recounted the incident, saying that the enraged roars of the Ents\nwere enough to crack the stones. They destroyed the buildings and\nmachinery on the plain, but could do nothing to hurt the tower itself.\nAt this point, the Ents took counsel and came up with a new plan of\nattack. By digging trenches and destroying Saruman's dam, the Ents and\nHuorns were to divert the course of the river Isen itself. As the Ents\ndid work destroying the dam, Gandalf appeared to Treebeard and the\nhobbits during the night. Gandalf took counsel with Treebeard, resulting\nin the Huorns' involvement at the Battle of the Hornburg. At midnight,\nthe Ents succeeded in destroying the dam, and the river flooded the\n'bowl' of Isengard, submerging everything but the tower and filling in\nall the tunnels and holes where the machinery of war had been. The\ndestruction of Isengard was complete, although Saruman was still\nuntouched in the tower. Some men from Dunland surrendered and were\nallowed to leave. The sound defeat of Saruman's hosts at the Battle of\nthe Hornburg and the destruction of his fortress rendered him incapable\nof causing the West any further military harm, although he still had the\npower of his persuasive and commanding voice, with which he could still\ndo (and did do) harm. Had the Ents not destroyed Isengard, despite the\ndestruction of Saruman's main army, he still could have withstood a\nsiege with his few remaining forces behind Isengard's normally\nimpregnable walls, biding his time until he could renew his strength.",

With her sister realm,\nNogrod, Belegost was dug deep beneath Mount Dolmed in the Blue Mountains\nin the Ages of Stars. Amongst the Dwarves of Belegost were the finest\nsmiths and stone-carvers in Middle-earth. In their armourer's halls they\nmade many bright weapons and were the first people to forge chain-mail.\nThe Dwarves of Belegost traded with the Sindar Elves of Beleriand and\nsupplied them with weapons of incomparably tempered steel; furthermore\nthese Dwarves carved the stone chambers of Menegroth. One of their\npayments for these services was Nimphelos, a great pearl. In the First\nAge, the Dwarves of Belegost and their lord, Azaghâl, won great fame in\nthe War of the Jewels. In the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the Dwarves alone\ncould withstand the heat of the Dragon-fire because being a race of\nsmiths were used to great heat and on their helms they wore masks of\nsteel. Their axes too that they forged were strong enough to hold the\nDragons in check. Though Azaghâl was slain, he wounded Glaurung, the\nFather of Dragons and the Dragon brood fled the battleground, all the\nway back to Angband. The Dwarves of Belegost were asked by the Dwarves\nof Nogrod for aid in their war against Doriath, but were refused.

Durin was\nset to sleep alone beneath Mount Gundabad in Middle-earth until the\nElves awoke. The name Durin, like other names of Tolkien's Dwarves, was\ntaken from Old Norse. In Tolkien's fiction, Dalish (the language of\nDale) had the same relationship to Rohirric and Westron as Old Norse has\nto English, so since Westron was rendered in English, the language of\nDale was rendered in Old Norse. The Dwarvish names were in the language\nof Dale, which therefore was rendered in Old Norse in _The Hobbit_ and\n_The Lord of the Rings._ J.R.R. Tolkien took Durin's name, as with most\nother dwarf names in his work, from real Norse mythology (in which\n_Durin_ was the name of the first of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves\nand the forger of many wonderful items). Upon his awakening at Mount\nGundabad in the Years of the Trees, he traveled until he came upon the\nMirrormere, the lake that the Dwarves call _Kheled-zâram_.

    "text": "The GLADDEN FIELDS were a marshland located in the vale of the Gladden\nriver, and on the banks of the river Anduin. It was there that the One\nRing was lost by Isildur and found again a long time later by Déagol the\nStoor. Geography The fields started near the mouth of the river Gladden,\nand went on beyond where it joined the Great River, extending onto its\neastern banks. It was a region of many dark pools and islets, with beds\nof reeds and rushes and many wildflowers - a particularly common flower\nbeing the Yellow Iris, which grew there in profusion. In ancient times\nwhen the Silvan Elves were in the region, there was a pool or lake at\nthe intersection of the two rivers; however, over time this receded,\nforming the marshes. History It was in the Gladden Fields that Isildur\nand his sons were travelling to Rivendell when they were assailed by\nOrcs in TA 2. Isildur, in an attempt to escape, jumped into the river,\nusing the Ring to keep hidden. However, the Ring slipped from his finger\nas he swam away, landing in the riverbed, and Isildur was slain by the\nOrcs' arrows on the bank of a small islet. The fields were later settled\nby Stoors around TA 1356. The Ring remained undiscovered. Around two and\na half millenia after the ambush, in TA 2463, the Hobbit Déagol found\nthe ring when he was fishing with his cousin Sméagol: an especially\nlarge fish pulled him under the water and, spotting it amongst the\nweeds, he took it to the bank. Ensnared by the Ring's power, the two\nfought over it, and ultimately it went to Sméagol, who killed Déagol and\nlater became the creature called Gollum. Later, around TA 2851, Saruman\nbegan searching the wetlands for the Ring. He found the Elendilmir, the\ntoken of Royalty of the North-kingdom, which Isildur had been wearing at\nthe time of the attack. At the meeting of the White Council that year,\nSaruman overruled Gandalf's suggestion that they purge Sauron from his\nstronghold in Dol Guldur. Sauron also sent his servants to search for\nthe Ring. When the White Council learned of this, they agreed to an\nattack on Dol Guldur to prevent Sauron from finding the Ring, in TA\n2941. At the meeting of the White Council in TA 2953, Saruman pretended\nthat he had learned that the Ring had been carried downriver to the Sea.\nEtymology Gladden Fields was Sindarin for LOEG NINGLORON."

    "title": "War of Wrath",
    "page_id": "862",
    "text": "The WAR OF WRATH, also called the GREAT BATTLE, was the war of Elves,\nMen, Dwarves and Valar against Morgoth at the end of the First Age,\nwhich marked the end of his rule in Middle-earth. It was the largest\nbattle of the First Age and possibly the largest battle ever to have\ntaken place in Middle-earth. It resulted in the expulsion of Morgoth\nfrom Arda and the ruin of the Thangorodrim, but the violence of the\nclashes between the forces of the Valar and Morgoth shattered the\nnorthwestern portion of Middle-earth, Beleriand, and caused it to sink\nbeneath the ocean. History Background By the early sixth century of the\nFirst Age, Morgoth's dominion had become completely uncontested in\nMiddle-earth. The power of the Elves, Men, and Dwarves to resist him had\nbeen utterly destroyed, and all the great kingdoms of the Elves had been\noverthrown. Morgoth was now master of nearly all of Beleriand, save for\nthe havens in Arvernien, which he gave little heed to. To make matters\nworse, and to the great amusement of Morgoth, the Sons of Fëanor,\nseeking the Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien, had launched two\ndevastatingly brutal Kinslayings in which they had destroyed both\nDoriath and the Havens of Sirion. In this time of need, the mariner\nEärendil, by the guidance of a Silmaril which he wore on his forehead,\nsearched for and came to Valinor on behalf of Elves and Men. There, he\nbegged the Valar to pardon and aid the overmatched peoples of\nMiddle-earth. The Battle Despite having pledged to leave the Ñoldor to\nreap the bitter harvest of their folly in pursuing Morgoth, Manwë was\nmoved by Eärendil's plea. Along with the Vanyar and the remaining Ñoldor\nin Aman, the host of the Valar came to Middle-earth in the mightiest\ngathering of arms in the history of Arda. The Teleri of Alqualondë\ngranted the use of their ships to ferry the hosts of Aman to\nMiddle-earth, but they remembered still the Kinslaying of their people\nlong ago and harbored much bitterness over it. As such, they sent only\nwhat mariners were needed to man the ships, and none of them set foot on\nMiddle-earth once they arrived. The great force of Aman marched across\nBeleriand, and met the armies of Morgoth in the plains of Anfauglith.\nMorgoth marshaled the entirety of his forces, which had by this point\ngrown so vast that Anfauglith could not contain their numbers. Though\nthe war lasted for over 40 years, the host of the Valar utterly\ndestroyed the Orc armies of Morgoth, as well as most of the Balrogs.\nWhile the Three Houses of Men fought alongside the Valar, many other Men\nfrom the East fought for the forces of Morgoth and were either destroyed\nor forced to flee back to the far eastern parts of Middle-earth. Facing\nfinal defeat, Morgoth released his ultimate weapon, the winged Dragons,\nwhich had never been seen before. Their terrible onslaught was\naccompanied by lightning storms and tempests of fire, and they drove the\nValar back and nearly destroyed the host of the West. Fortunately,\nEärendil came with his sky-ship Vingilot, along with the Eagles of Manwë\nled by Thorondor. In the skies above Angband, they confronted the\ndragons, and Eärendil himself slew their captain, the mighty Ancalagon\nthe Black, who broke the towers of Thangorodrim in his fall. Angband was\nthen leveled and Morgoth was finally captured in the deepest of his\nmines. He sued for peace and pardon, but he was bound again with the old\nchain Angainor and the two Silmarils still in his possession were taken\nby the Maia Eönwë, the herald of Manwë. Morgoth was taken to Aman and\ntried for his crimes. In the end, the Valar un-housed Morgoth by\nbeheading him and “thrust him through the Door of Night”, beyond the\nWalls of the World, into the Timeless Void, the doors of which are\nforever guarded by Ëarendil. Aftermath The geographical wreckage of the\nwar was immense; most of the land west of the Blue Mountains was\ndestroyed and sank beneath the waves. Though it is not known exactly how\nmany casualties the Host of the West endured, the war dragged on for\ndecades before they managed to approach Angband, and the attack of\nMorgoth's winged dragons was known to have been nearly catastrophic for\nthe forces of the Valar. While the hosts of Morgoth were utterly\ndefeated, the creatures that composed them were not eradicated, and many\n(particularly Orcs) remained to trouble the world under the power of\nSauron. Additionally, it was noted that a few Balrogs fled and hid deep\nin the Earth, though only one, known by the title of Durin's Bane, was\never noted by history to have appeared again. Some number of dragons,\nparticularly Cold-drakes, also hid themselves away in the mountains.\nThese dragons bred over time, and became particularly troublesome for\nthe Dwarves in ages to come. Nearly all of the winged Fire-drakes were\ndestroyed by Ëarendil, Thorondor and his Eagles, but some managed to\nescape, as at least one of the species, Smaug the Golden, was known to\nhave been active during the Third Age. The remaining Elves were bidden\nby Ëonwë to return with him to the lands of Aman. Most of the Elves went\ninto the West, while others still refused the summons and rather\njourneyed eastward where they would become lords of the remaining Eldar\nor those Elves who still dwelt in the East. Gil-galad, Galadriel,\nCeleborn, and Elrond were chief among these. Additionally, the victory\nwas made even more bitter by the loss of the Silmarils. Maedhros and\nMaglor, the two surviving sons of Fëanor, were compelled by their oath\nto recover the gems. Though sick at heart at the burden of the terrible\noath, they conspired to sneak into the camp of the victorious Host of\nthe Valar, where they slew the guard around the Silmarils and took them.\nThe camp was roused against them, and though they were prepared to fight\nto the death to keep the gems, they were permitted to go. But they soon\ndiscovered that, due to the wicked deeds they had performed in\nrecovering the jewels, first among them the three Kinslayings, they\ncould not hold the Silmarils without suffering terrible pain. And so\nMaedhros cast himself and the Silmaril he bore into a fiery pit, and\nMaglor threw his into the Sea. And so both were lost to the Host of the\nValar, and they returned to Aman empty handed. For those men of the\nEdain who fought for the host of the Valar, the land of Númenor (in the\nfull Quenya form Nùmenórë) was given to them. This land was neither of\nAman nor of Middle-earth, but was closer to Aman.",

Description The wide and open regions of Lothlann,\nMaglor's Gap, Thargelion, and the Ossiriand made up the majority of the\nEast Beleriand. They were lands consisting mostly of hills and lowlands\nwith dense forests, scattered woodlands, scrubs, stunted trees, and\nthickets. Climates varied from severely cold and dry winters with short\nand cold summers, to mild winters with mild summers. All of which were\nunder the influence of the cold and dry winds from Dor Daidelos and the\nIron Mountains to the north, and the warm and moist winds coming from\nthe sea. History Before the Return of the Ñoldor, the areas of the East\nBeleriand were inhabited by the Laiquendi living in the Ossiriand and\nthe Sindar in other parts. When the Ñoldor did return, the majority of\nthe region was under control of Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir,\nCurufin, Amrod and Amras, the Sons of Fëanor.

History When the world was young and Arda was bathed in the light\nof the two lamps Illuin and Ormal, Melkor first dug the great Pits of\nUtumno deep beneath the mountains of the North. The fortress was\nconstructed in the North in the Iron Mountains over one thousand miles\nfrom the later location of Angband, where the light of the lamps was\nalmost nonexistent. Here were gathered all the evil powers of the World\nunder the Lord of Darkness. Their numbers were vast, and Melkor had\ntwisted many beautiful things into horrifying and dreadful forms. Many\nof the great evils of the world were bred in this place, such as trolls,\n“made in mockery of the ents” as stated by Treebeard. It is probable\nthat the Orcs were first bred here also, by the mutilating and\ncorruption of lost Elves. Cruel spirits, phantoms, wraiths, and evil\ndemons stalked the halls of Utumno and haunted the surrounding forests.\nAll were under the command of Melkor and his fallen Maiar servants;\nGothmog the Lord of the Balrogs and Sauron the Sorcerer. From Utumno,\nMelkor poisoned and interfered with all the Valar's work done during the\nSpring of Arda. Soon afterwards, Melkor and his servants waged his war\nagainst the lamps of the Valar and struck them down, ruining the world,\nand forcing the Valar to move further west to the continent of Aman.\nUtumno endured for many more millennia well into the early years of the\nElves at Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees when Middle-earth lay\nin the light of stars. Taking advantage of the new arrivals, Melkor\ncaptured some of them and thus, the hideous race of orcs was bred.\nKnowing that Melkor would continue to be a blight upon the world, the\nValar decided to protect the elves by ending his power in the north.\nAmidst the sounding of the trumpets, the Valar came out of the west, and\nafter the Battle of the Powers Utumno was besieged and destroyed in VY\n1099 , and Melkor was chained for about three thousand years.

History Dor-lómin was first\ncolonized by the Ñoldor on their return to Middle-earth, Dor-lómin\nbecame the lordship of Fingon, but in the fifth Century FA Fingolfin\ngave it to Hador. Dor-lómin became a fief of the Third House of the\nEdain, which flourished there, strengthened by refugees of the First\nHouse from Dorthonion, until the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. Morgoth gave\nDor-lómin, together with the rest of Hithlum, to his Easterlings, who\nabsorbed or enslaved the surviving Edain. Tuor son of Huor was fostered\nby the Elves of Androth in the Mountains of Mithrim. Before the Nirnaeth\nArnoediad, the army of Dor-lómin was between 12,000 and 15,000. The\nentire host was destroyed during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. After Túrin\nfled south over the Ered Wethrin bands of outlaws came and attacked and\nenslaved the peoples of _Dor-lómin_, save Morwen, her daughter Nienor,\nand her servants, including Sador Labadal. The outlaws were led by\nBrodda, who wedded Aerin so that when he was dead, he would have an heir\nto keep the land under his family's rule. Over a year after Túrin came\nto Doriath, Morwen and Nienor went seeking Túrin in Menegroth. Later,\nTúrin came to seek Morwen in Dor-lómin, but they had already gone south\nover the mountains. Like the rest of Hithlum it was destroyed during the\nWar of Wrath. Etymology _Dor-lómin_ was a Sindarin word that meant 'Land\nof Echoes'.",

It was destroyed at the\nconclusion of the War of Wrath. Description Angband was a primarily\nsubterranean stronghold under the three volcanic mountains of\nThangorodrim, the largest mountains in Middle-earth. Before the Great\nGate, there was a somber court area flanked by frightening cliffs and\nwalled by the towers of a great battlement. Through the gate, there was\na long great tunnel leading to a 'labyrinthine pyramid' of stairs to\ncorridors, tunnels, and smithy chambers. A tall chimney went from\nMorgoth's gigantic blast furnaces and smithies, up through the mountain\nto the smokey towers of Thangorodrim. There were also many tunnels\nleading to the slave quarters or vaults. At the foundation of Angband\nwas the entrance to Morgoth's throne room in the Nethermost Hall. There\nwere also mines within Angband that extended deeper than Morgoth's\nthrone room. History Melkor originally built Angband to guard against a\npossible attack from Aman by the Valar, and placed it under the command\nof Sauron. However, at the initiation of the War of Powers, the assault\nof the Valar leveled Angband without much difficulty, and forced Melkor\nto flee to his primary stronghold of Utumno. However, Angband's\nunderground vaults and caverns were left relatively intact after the\nValar's onslaught, as they were in great haste to capture Melkor for the\nsake of keeping the newly-awakened Elves safe. After Melkor's defeat at\nUtumno, the Balrogs came to Angband and went into hibernation in its\nruined foundations. Eventually, the Orcs began to multiply in great\nnumbers in Angband's ruins, and soon made their way south into\nBeleriand, threatening the Dwarves and Thingol's kingdom. It is possible\nthat Sauron remained in the ruins of Angband with the Balrogs, as he had\npresumably been commanding the fortress when it was attacked. However,\nit is not certain where Sauron dwelt during Melkor's imprisonment. After\nthree ages, Melkor was released, destroyed the Two Trees of Valinor,\nstole the Silmarils and escaped from Aman. After fleeing, Melkor, now\nnamed _Morgoth_ by his enemies, returned to Middle-earth and re-delved\nthe ruins of Angband, raising the volcanic peaks of Thangorodrim over\nit. These peaks were created from the slag and rubble caused by the\nre-delving of the fortress, and as such, it is likely that the rebuilt\nAngband extended for a considerably greater distance underground than\nit's original incarnation had. From his dark throne in the Nethermost\nHall, Morgoth directed the war against the Ñoldor who had returned from\nthe West, and all the Free Peoples that supported them in Beleriand.\nUltimately, he achieved complete victory over them. At the end of\nthe First Age, the Valar took pity on the Ñoldor and instigated the War\nof Wrath, which not only utterly destroyed Angband but broke most of\nnorthern Middle-earth so throughly that it sank beneath the ocean.\nEarlier versions of the legendarium In earlier versions of Tolkien's\nmythology (see _The History of Middle-earth_) Angband was called\nANGAMANDO, which is the Quenya form of the name.

History Watchtower of the Ñoldor\nMinas Tirith was built early in the First Age by Finrod Felagund, to\nkeep watch upon the doings of Morgoth on the northern plain of\nArd-galen.

Afterwards, Sauron began breeding\nlarge wolves in the isle which he sent evil spirits in, turning them\ninto werewolves. About ten years later during the Quest for the\nSilmaril, Sauron imprisoned Beren Erchamion and Finrod there. Finrod was\nslain, but Beren was rescued by Lúthien and the Hound Huan.

    "text": "GONDOLIN was a hidden city of the Elves located approximately in the\nmiddle of the land of Beleriand in Middle-earth. It was founded by\nTurgon the Wise, a Ñoldorin lord in the early First Age. It endured the\nlongest of all the Ñoldorin kingdoms in exile, lasting nearly\nfour-hundred years of the Sun. History As recounted in _The\nSilmarillion_, the Vala Ulmo, the Lord of Waters, revealed the location\nof the Vale of Tumladen to the Noldorin Lord Turgon in a dream around\nthe year FA 50. Under this divine guidance, Turgon travelled from his\nkingdom in Nevrast and found the vale in FA 53. Within the Encircling\nMountains just west of Dorthonion and east of the river Sirion, lay a\nround level plain with sheer walls on all sides and a ravine and tunnel\nleading out to the southwest known as the Hidden Way. In the middle of\nthe vale there was a steep hill which was called Amon Gwareth. There\nTurgon decided to found a great city that would be protected by the\nmountains and hidden from the Dark Lord Morgoth. For nearly seventy-five\nyears, Turgon and his people built Gondolin in secret. After it was\ncompleted in FA 116, he took with him to dwell in the hidden city his\nentire people in Nevrast — almost a third of the Ñoldor — as well as\nnearly three quarters of the northern Sindar. The city stood for nearly\n400 years until it was betrayed to Morgoth by Maeglin, Turgon's nephew,\nand sacked shortly thereafter by the Dark Lord's forces. Gondolin was\ndescribed as this - “Now the streets of Gondolin were paved with stone\nand wide, kerbed with marble, and fair houses and courts amid gardens of\nbright flowers were set about the ways, and many towers of great\nslenderness and beauty builded of white marble and carved most\nmarvelously rose to the heaven. Squares there were lit with fountains\nand the home of birds that sang amid the branches of their aged trees,\nbut of all these the greatest was that place where stood the King's\npalace, and the tower thereof was the loftiest in the city, and the\nfountains that played before the doors shot twenty fathoms and seven in\nthe air and fell in a singing rain of crystal; therein did the sun\nglitter splendidly by day, and the moon most magically shimmered by\nnight. The birds that dwelt there were of the whiteness of snow and\ntheir voices sweeter than a lullaby of music.” Specifications The Hidden\nWay was protected by seven gates, all constantly guarded; the first of\nwood, then stone, Bronze, Iron, Silver, Gold, and Steel. Etymology It\nwas originally called _ONDOLINDË_, which is Quenya for “The Rock of the\nMusic of Water”, after the springs of Amon Gwareth.

    "text": "'''Orthanc '''was the black, impenetrable tower of Isengard built by the\nDúnedain. By the Great Years and the War of the Ring it was possessed by\nthe wizard Saruman the White. It stood in the centre of the Ring of\nIsengard, surrounded by great defensive walls fortified by the early Men\nof Gondor. Description ''“A great ring-wall of stone, like towering\ncliffs, stood out from the shelter of the mountain-side, from which it\nran and then returned again... one who passed in and came at length out\nof the echoing tunnel, beheld a plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed\nlike a vast shallow bowl: a mile it measured from rim to rim. Once it\nhad been green and filled with avenues, and groves of fruitful trees,\nwatered by streams that flowed from the mountains to a lake. But no\ngreen thing grew there in the latter days of Saruman. The roads were\npaved with stone-flags dark and hard; and beside their borders instead\nof trees there marched long lines of pillars, some of marble, some of\ncopper and of iron, joined by heavy chains, to the centre all the roads\nran between their chains. There stood a tower of marvelous shape. It was\nfashioned by the builders of old, who smoothed the Ring of Isengard, and\nyet it seemed a thing not made by the craft of Men, but riven from the\nbones of the earth in the ancient torment of the hills. A peak and isle\nof rock it was, black and gleaming hard: four mighty piers of many-sided\nstone were welded into one, but near the summit they opened into gaping\nhorns, their pinnacles sharp as the points of spears, keen-edged as\nknives. Between them was a narrow space, and there upon a floor of\npolished stone, written with strange signs, a man might stand five\nhundred feet above the plain.” '' - Orthanc as depicted by J.R.R Tolkien\nThe tower was constructed out of four piers of stone and then hardened\nby an unknown process. No weaponry or magic that existed on Arda was\nknown to be able to harm it. Until the Ents that besieged Isengard\nduring the War of the Ring managed to inflict slight damage on the\ntower, but their efforts ultimately proved to be futile. When Grima\nthrew the Orthanc stone it fell on the stairs; the rail snapped and part\nof the staircase broke. The only entrance to the tower was reached by a\nstair of twenty-seven steps, the door could only be opened with the Keys\nof Orthanc. Above the door there was a balcony, and many tall windows\nhigher up. History Second Age The exact date of construction of Orthanc\nand establishment of Isengard is unknown; however it must have been\nbuilt between SA 3320, the time of the establishment of Arnor and\nGondor, and SA 3430, when the Last Alliance of Elves and Men was formed.\nWithin the fortified walls of the tower was placed one of the Palantíri,\nthe Stone of Orthanc. Thus, Orthanc was now known as one of the seven\ntowers of the Dúnedain, housing the seventh seeing stone brought back\nfrom Númenor by Elendil. Third Age Orthanc suffered greatly during the\nGreat Plague of TA 1636, and many of the Númenóreans that inhabited it\ngradually migrated eastward. Eventually the tower itself became deserted\nand its keys being moved to Minas Tirith to be kept by the Stewards of\nGondor. After the Battle of the Field of Celebrant in TA 2510, a small\ngroup of Men of Gondor travelled to Isengard and maintained the fortress\non their own. However, the Keys of Orthanc still officially belonged to\nthe Stewards of Gondor. Over time, Orthanc lost its connections with\nMinas Tirith and the Men of Gondor failed to maintain the tower\nsuccessfully. The Dunlendings then took over the fortress and launched\nmany attacks on the Westfold. In the Long Winter of TA 2754, the\nDunlendings were eventually starved out due to the famine caused by the\nlack of communication to all food suppliers. Then Saruman put in an\noffer for the control of Isengard and both King Fréaláf and Steward\nBeren embraced the proposition with open arms. Thus, the wizard was\nhanded the keys to Orthanc. After gaining the control of Isengard,\nSaruman became greatly interested in the Rings of Power and began to\nespecially desire the One. He thought that if he gave time for Sauron to\nregain some strength, the ring would reveal itself to him. Therefore, as\nhead of the White Council, Saruman overruled Gandalf's call for an\nattack on Dol Guldur, the Dark Lord's then current fortress. However in\nTA 2941, he did agree on the attack when he found out that the servants\nof Sauron were searching for the ring near the Gladden Fields. Later,\nSaruman's mind was corrupted and fell under the control of Sauron when\nhe used the Stone of Orthanc—the seventh Palantiri—for the first time.\nIn TA 3018, Gandalf rode to Isengard to meet with Saruman. It was then\nthat the wizard declared his true thoughts regarding his desire to be\nruler of Men, to possess the Ring, and to join Sauron in his evil deeds.\nGandalf refused Saruman's offer to join him and Sauron. Subsequently,\nthe wizard held Gandalf captive on Orthanc's pinnacle until he submitted\nin telling the location of the One Ring. After many weeks of\nimprisonment, Gwaihir, the Lord of the Eagles, came unlooked for and\nbore him away. Only months later, the Ents of Fangorn Forest launched\ntheir attack on Isengard. By the next day, only the tower of Orthanc\nremained, as it was hewn of one piece of impenetrable rock, and the\nplains below had been completely destroyed, leaving a desolate land of\nwater and mud. Three days after the battle, Theoden, Éomer, Gandalf,\nAragorn, Legolas, and Gimli approached Orthanc past a desolation of\nwreckage caused by the Ents including a huge blood-ridden white hand,\nand climbed its stair. They parleyed with Saruman, who remained inside\nthe tower and spoke to them from a balcony above the door. After Saruman\nrefused to cooperate and attempted to control the Rohirrim riding with\nthem, Gandalf cast him from the Order of Wizards and the White Council,\nbreaking Saruman's Staff. After the confrontation, Grima Wormtongue—who\nwas inside the tower at the time—threw the Stone of Orthanc at the party\noutside as a parting shot. Fourth Age One of King Elessar's first tasks\nhe had set was the restoration of Orthanc. He ordered that the Palantir\nshould be recovered and returned to the tower. Then Orthanc was searched\nand many secrets were revealed. It was clear that Saruman had been\nhoarding many ancient treasures and heirlooms during his time there.\nWith the aid of Wormtongue, Saruman had acquired many jewels and\nheirlooms belonging to Eorl. Soon a hidden door was found and inside a\ncasket they found two precious objects: one of which was a small gold\ncase attached to a chain - this was used by Isildur to bear the One\nRing; and second of which was the Elendilmir - the 'white star of Elvish\ncrystal upon a fillet of mithril' that had been lost since Isildur's\ndemise. Elessar received the Elendilmir with reverence and took it with\nhim as he established his full kingship of Arnor. It was revealed that\nSaruman had found the remains of Isildur and had burned them. Orthanc\nand the plains of Isengard around it remained part of the Reunited\nKingdom of Arnor and Gondor. However, King Elessar granted the Ents\ncomplete self-governance of the area surrounding the tower. This new\nforest became known as the Treegarth of Orthanc. Pinnacle of Orthanc The\nPinnacle of Orthanc was the summit of Saruman's tower. Its corners were\nrazor-edged points with room for at least two men to stand. It was\naccessed by a flight of thousands of stairs, which Saruman would use to\nreach the top and observe the stars. It was here where Saruman\nimprisoned Gandalf at the start of the War of the Ring, which caused him\nto be delayed in meeting with Frodo. He was rescued by the Great Eagle\nGwaihir, sent by Radagast the Brown. Etymology According to Tolkien, its\nname is both Sindarin for “Mount Fang”, and Rohirric for “Cunning Mind”.\nThe latter is more likely to be its real meaning, as the word _Orthanc_\nis a real Old English word (Old English being the linguistic basis for\nRohirric); the Sindarin name being no more than a poetic coincidence. In\nOld English, Orþanc means “cunning device”, but Tolkien has said this is\nmerely a coincidence.",

    "text": "The KINGDOM OF RHOVANION was a realm of Men in the Middle-earth region\nof Rhovanion that is rarely given specifications in Tolkien's books.\nSummary The kingdom of Rhovanion was founded by the northmen and\nstretched from Mirkwood, in the west, to Dorwinion, in the east. It had\nstrong ties with the kingdom of Gondor and fought side by side in its\nwars against the Easterlings of Rhûn. History In the early Third Age, a\ngroup of Northmen who were led by a 'Prince of Rhovanion' who founded\nthe Kingdom of Rhovanion sometime before the year TA 490. Rhovanion at\nthis time referred only to the region where he and his people dwelt, a\nstrip of land east of Greenwood the Great and south of Dale and\nLake-town. It is possible that Dale and Lake-town formed part of the\nKingdom before the Dwarven Kingdom in the Lonely Mountain was founded by\nthe Dwarves of Durin's Folk. The Men of Rhovanion fought with Gondor\nagainst the Easterlings of Rhûn, who threatened their lands, and when\nthese were defeated by King Turambar of Gondor in TA 550, Rhovanion\nbecame an ally of Gondor. By TA 1200 the ruler of Rhovanion called\nhimself the King of Rhovanion. In TA 1248 Rómendacil II of Gondor\ndestroyed all camps of the Easterlings even beyond the Sea of Rhûn, and\na strong alliance with Rhovanion was forged. Gondor withdrew its borders\nto the Anduin, and ceded all the lands east of Anduin to Rhovanion. From\nthis time onward, the name Rhovanion referred to all of Wilderland. The\nKing of Rhovanion at this time was Vidugavia, and Prince Valacar of\nGondor served in his army. Vidugavia's daughter Vidumavi married\nValacar, and their son Vinitharya became King Eldacar of Gondor in TA\n1432, which led to the Kin-strife in TA 1437. Eldacar fled to Rhovanion,\nand with a Rhovanion army, he reclaimed his Kingdom in TA 1447. In TA\n1636 the Great Plague devastated Rhovanion, killing more than half its\npeople. This left Rhovanion weakened, and in TA 1851 the Wainriders\noverran and enslaved Rhovanion. For 43 years Rhovanion was enslaved, but\nin TA 1899 Rhovanion rebelled, while Gondor attacked the Wainriders from\nthe west. Rhovanion was freed, but left extremely weakened. Many Men of\nRhovanion left for Gondor, where they were welcomed as distant\nrelatives. Some of them may have gone north to Dale and Lake-town after\nTA 1999, when the Kingdom under the Mountain was founded. In TA 2460\nSauron returned to Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood, although this was\nnot learned until long after. The land gradually became more dangerous,\nand Rhovanion was emptied of most its people. Around TA 2510 a new group\nof Easterlings, the Balchoth, appeared, and they quickly took the old\nlands of Rhovanion. This was the final end of the Kingdom of Rhovanion\nafter over two thousand years of independence.",

It was the first permanent settlement\nof the Númenóreans in Middle-earth. From here Aldarion's “Guild of\nVenturers” began harvesting the local timber for the shipbuilding\nindustry of Númenor. Within a few centuries, the deforestation of the\noutlying regions Enedwaith and Minhiriath became cataclysmic, angering\nthe local native population (ancestors of the Dunlendings), and they\nbegan to fight back with increasing ferocity, destroying the haven\nseveral times, and frequently burning the great wood-stores in\n'hit-and-run' attacks. By the time of the War of the Elves and Sauron in\nthe middle of the Second Age, this 'New Haven' had become very well\nestablished, and its name had shifted over the intervening one thousand\nyears to 'Lond Daer', the Great Haven. As such, it was one of the two\nbeachheads of the Númenórean forces in Eriador that were used to support\nthe elves around SA 1700. Lond Daer's shipyards were starved of timber\nfollowing the war, as the forces of Sauron had burnt almost all of what\nremained in Enedwaith and Minhiriath. Once its shipbuilding yards were\nno longer practicable, Lond Daer declined in importance, and the\nNúmenórean hunger for ever more wealth shifted focus to the\nestablishment of newer havens to the south, Pelargir and Umbar.\nFollowing this, Lond Daer was once again renamed, being now one of\nseveral major ports in Middle-earth, and was known as LOND DAER ENEDH,\nor 'Great Middle Haven'. Despite this, Númenor still maintained traffic\non the Gwathló as far as the city of Tharbad. After the Downfall of\nNúmenor, Elendil founded the realm of Arnor in the lands north of Lond\nDaer, but the haven was now redundant, and fell into ruin. Instead,\ncontrol over the region was maintained from Tharbad.

History During the Third Age, the\nÉothéod are first mentioned when they migrated under their King Frumgar\nto the confined area between the rivers Langwell and Greylin, sources of\nthe Great River Anduin, near where the Grey Mountains met the Misty\nMountains. They went that way after the fall of Angmar, away from the\nravages of the Easterlings and Orcs. Some time later their king Fram,\nson of Frumgar, slew the dragon Scatha.

History The war began in SA 1693, almost a century after Sauron\nhad deceived the Ñoldor of Eregion and had forged the One Ring,\ndeceiving and claiming all the Rings of Power from the fortress\nOst-in-Edhil, except the Three Rings of the Elves. Messages of this\nbetrayal were sent north to Lindon where the High King Gil-galad ruled,\nand he began amassing his forces, preparing for an invasion. He also\ncalled for help from Númenor. In SA 1695 Sauron attacked, crossing the\nFords of Isen and beginning the Siege of Eregion. Elrond was sent to\nEregion by Gil-galad with reinforcements. However, in SA 1697 Eregion\nwas laid waste. Celebrimbor, Lord of Eregion, was killed, and\nKhazad-dûm's gates were closed. Elrond fled north with the survivors,\nfounding Rivendell.

The next\nyear a great army of Númenor arrived, sent by Tar-Minastir and commanded\nby Ciryatur, which landed in Lindon, at Tharbad on the Gwathló, and\nsouth near Pelargir.

    "text": "MINHIRIATH was a region of Eriador in Middle-earth. Its expanse covered\nthe western half of the lands between the Misty Mountains and the Blue\nMountains (Ered Luin). Minhiriath had no clear border in the north, but\nto the south, and east and west it was bounded by river and sea: the\nBrandywine, the Greyflood and the Belegaer, 'The Great Sea'. History The\noriginal inhabitants of Minhiriath (Minhiriathrim) were descended from\nthe same Men as the ancestors of the Númenóreans, but because they spoke\nmutually unintelligible languages, the Númenóreans did not class the\nMinhiriathrim as Middle Men. When the large-scale deforestation of their\nland began under the Númenórean 'Ship Kings' after the 7th century\nSecond Age, the Minhiriathrim became openly hostile, and were\npersecuted. Only those who “fled from Minhiriath into the dark woods of\nthe great Cape of Eryn Vorn” survived. Most, if not all of these\nforest-dwellers subsequently “welcomed Sauron and hoped for his victory\nover the Men of the Sea”, but they were to be disappointed - and\npermanently trapped - by Sauron's burning of much of the rest of the\nsurviving forest, and final defeat, in SA 1701. From SA 3320, Minhiriath\nbecame nominally part of the newly established Kingdom of Arnor, at\nwhich time it formed the upper part of _..a land that was far and wide,\non either bank a desert, treeless but untilled._ ('The History of\nGaladriel and Celeborn' from Unfinished Tales) From TA 861, Minhiriath\nwas inherited by one of Arnor's three successor states, Cardolan, but\nthe “ravaging” of Cardolan by the evil forces of the Witch-king of\nAngmar in TA 1409 no doubt caused extensive depopulation of the whole\ncountry. Even worse was the advent of the Great Plague in TA 1636, after\nwhich Minhiriath was “almost entirely deserted”. After TA 1975, even\nthough “a few secretive hunter-folk lived in the woods” throughout the\nThird Age (probably a reference which includes Eryn Vorn), Minhiriath\nwas claimed by no kingdom at all. Although “still in places well-wooded”\nby the time of the War of the Ring, the once continuously forested\nMinhiriath bore the permanent scars of over 5000 years of felling,\nburning, and war. The same is not necessarily the case for its human\npopulation, however, when talking of Eriador (and particularly the lands\nsouth and west of Bree) to an innkeeper at the end of the War of the\nRing. For example, Gandalf confidently predicts that _..the waste in\ntime will be waste no longer, and there will be people and fields where\nonce there was wilderness._ Etymology _Minhiriath_ was a Sindarin word\nthat meant 'Between Rivers' and thus an Elvish form of _Mesopotamia_)."

    "text": "The BLACK NÚMENÓREANS were a fallen group of Númenóreans who were\ndescended from those loyal to the Númenórean crown but opposed to the\nValar and relations with the Elves. They listened to the words of\nSauron. Soon they were corrupted by him, and would come to worship the\nDarkness and Morgoth. History Second Age Origins As the power and\nknowledge of the Númenóreans grew throughout the course of the Second\nAge, they became increasingly preoccupied with the limits placed on\ntheir contentment in the world - and eventually their power - by\nmortality, the purpose of which they began to question. As time went on\nthey began to fear death more and more and ultimately wished to escape\nit. So the Númenóreans became envious of the immortal Elves (the Eldar),\nwhom they had come to physically resemble as part of their reward from\nIlúvatar for having been their allies. The Eldar sought ever to remind\nthe Men of Númenor however, that death was a gift from Ilúvatar to all\nMen, and to lose faith in Ilúvatar would be heretical. Nevertheless,\nafter SA 2221, when Tar-Ancalimon became King of Númenor. The 'King's\nMen' therefore became increasingly predisposed to the corruption of\nSauron after he came to Númenor. Eventually, in Númenor's last years,\nits hugely powerful but elderly King Ar-Pharazôn, who had become\n“frightened of old age” (_Letters_, no.156), was persuaded by Sauron\nthat Ilúvatar was a lie invented by the Valar, and seduced him. Within\nNúmenor, the majority immediately followed suit, and this worship\nquickly passed across the ocean when they sailed eastwards from Númenor,\nto most of Númenor's colonies in Middle-earth where the group started in\nproper. The group thrived in Middle-earth, particularly in Umbar after\nthe destruction of Númenor. They continued to oppose The Faithful, from\nwhich came the Kings of Arnor and Gondor, the Black Númenóreans remained\nloyal towards Sauron. Three of the Ringwraiths can be considered among\nthe first and most powerful Númenóreans who were corrupted by\nSauron, 1000 years before the Downfall: they served Sauron, being\nenslaved to his will, having become so because of their lust for power\nor knowledge. These sacrilegious 'black arts' and 'follies', which arose\nas a consequence of their worship of 'The Dark' and Melkor, marked the\nfinal, irrevocable division between the 'King's Men' and the minority\nknown as the 'Faithful' Númenóreans, or the 'Elendili', who kept to\ntheir old faith in Ilúvatar. They were also presumably the earliest\nculture traits of those who became known afterwards as Black\nNúmenóreans. After the Fall of Númenor For many centuries after the\nDownfall, descendants of the 'King's Men' held onto colonies in\nMiddle-earth, what became the most northerly and famous of their Realms\nin Exile, Umbar. Most of those few Númenóreans who had never disavowed\nthe Eldar, and had always remained true to their belief in Ilúvatar,\nalso survived the destruction of their homeland, and they established\ntheir own Realms in Exile north of Umbar, in familiar and friendly\ncolonies. The Faithful Númenóreans saw their southern counterparts as\nrenegades. The Black Númenóreans held a similarly low opinion of 'The\nFaithful' and their descendants. Only two Black Númenórean lords are\nnamed from the time of the late Second Age: Herumor and Fuinur. Like all\nBlack Númenóreans and 'King's Men' before them, Herumor and Fuinur\ndesired power over men of other, lesser races, and they “rose to (great)\npower amongst the Haradrim”, the peoples neighbouring Umbar. Their fate\nis unknown, but they were likely defeated along with Sauron at the War\nof the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. Third Age The Black Númenórean\nstyle of rule was no doubt tyrannical, but may also have involved a\ntradition of duumviracy, at least in Umbar, whose lords are usually\npaired when mentioned; Herumor/Fuinur for example, were probably rulers\nof Umbar, as much later Angamaitë/Sangahyando were. Whatever political\nsystem was in place, however, the Black Númenóreans did not govern\neffectively. The triumph of the Last Alliance marked the decline of the\nBlack Númenórean race and the end of their racial superiority.\nNevertheless, the Black Númenórean elite survived at least in Umbar for\nover a thousand years after Númenor's fall, maintaining much influence\nin Haradwaith. As late as Angamaitë for example, even after being exiled\nfrom their homeland for nearly a century. Black Numenoreans in the 3rd\nage eventually joined The Witch King of Angmar in his conquests of\nArnor. The fate of the Black Numenoreans of Angmar is unknown, but it's\nmost likely they either all died or disbanded after the Battle of\nFornost. The Black Númenóreans did not use Westron, but probably\nretained their old tongue Adûnaic, speaking a dialect of it. (In The\nNotion Club Papers, part of Sauron Defeated, Arundel Lowdham cited two\ndescendants of classical Adûnaic. One of these must have been Westron,\nthe other the tongue of the Black Númenóreans (Black Adûnaic?). The\nBlack Númenóreans are absent from recorded history after their defeat by\nCiryaher in TA 1050, but a population of sorts must have survived\nsomewhere at least until the end of the Third Age, as the Mouth of\nSauron, who mocked the army of King Elessar in front of the Black Gate\nwas described both as a Black Númenórean and “Renegade”, which is\npresumably the term used by the Free Peoples of that time to describe\nall folk of similar ancestry. In one of his letters, Tolkien wrote that\nQueen Berúthiel, wife of Gondor's King Tarannon Falastur was a Black\nNúmenórean, from a Black Númenórean realm he describes as “the inland\ncity” somewhere south of Umbar. This was a loveless union, and was\npresumably a political accommodation: that such arrangements were\npossible implies the existence at that time of more Gondor-friendly\nBlack Númenóreans than the much later Mouth of Sauron.",

Origins As mentioned, the\nNúmenóreans were the descendants of the Edain, the Elf-friends of the\nFirst Age. As a reward for their services during the War of Wrath, the\nValar gave them an island continent in the western sea which became\nNúmenor as their abiding place. They also gifted with far longer life\n(300 years or more average), greater height, and greater wisdom.\nNúmenor, which had been raised up by Ulmo, was shaped like a star upon\nthe ocean, and was in between Aman and Middle-earth. These Edain reached\nthe island in the year 32 S.A.. Elros, the brother of Elrond, was their\nfirst king. Physical Characteristics Being descendants of the Edain, the\nmen of Númenor were well bred. Exceptionally strong individuals were\nlegendary. Most had dark hair, however lighter hairs (blondes) did\nexist. They were also on average very tall; with Six foot, four inches\nbeing the average among them. Many far exceeded such height; Elendil\nhimself being nicknamed “_ELENDIL THE TALL_” being over seven feet high.\nOne characteristic that set them apart from typical men was their ages.\nNúmenóreans were not immortal as the Elves or Ainur, however in\ngratitude in their service during the War of the Wrath, they were\nblessed with extended lifespans averaging over 300 years. Bloodlines\nfrom the House of Elros could live for over 400-500. They aged slower\nthan their typical counterparts. History From the start, the friendship\nof the Númenóreans was between the Dúnedain of the West and the Eldar of\nEressëa. The white swan ships of those Eldar brought many gifts to the\nNúmenóreans: birds, trees, herbs, and more. Unfortunately, as time\nprogressed, the kings of Numenor began to envy the Eldar for their\nimmortality, and a fear of death infected the island. Later on, kings\nfell dead, decrepit and witless, as they hopelessly clung to their\nlives. Thus faded the bliss of the Númenóreans, if not their power. They\nhad sailed the earth to the East in their wooden ships, and even\nglimpsed from their tall ship prows the Gates of Morning, in the eastern\ncontinent. They founded many colonies in Mortal Lands, north and south,\nand there they ruled. With the gradual creation of a colonial empire,\nthe pride of the Kings grew. The old customs were for the most part\nabandoned; those that were kept were kept out of fear of the Valar. Most\nof the Númenóreans distanced themselves from the Eldar, and towards the\nend they persecuted any who were in fellowship with them. The 25th King,\nand also the last, Ar-Pharazôn, was made angry by the reemerging\nSauron in Mordor. The King sent a vast army, so large and imposing that\nSauron found himself deserted by his own armies, not a single large\nbattle fought. But what Sauron could not crush with his armies, he would\nmanipulate with cunning mind and honeyed-tongue. He prostrated himself\nbefore Pharazôn, and was taken prisoner. In less than three years, the\nDark Lord had gone from top-priority prisoner to the King's greatest\ncouncilor. All save one (Lord Amandil of Andúnië) of the Royal Council\nfawned on Sauron. After many years, the king felt the shadow of death\nnear, and Sauron, ever the opportunist, seized his chance. He told the\naging king of “The Giver of Freedom and Life” Melkor, behind closed\ndoors. The king, desperate to escape death, turned to the worship of the\nDark. At Sauron's urging, a great temple was built, and the tree\nNimloth was cut down, though not before Isildur, Amandil's grandson,\nescaped with a fruit of the tree. In the year 3310 SA, Sauron urged\nPharazôn to take what the king desired for so long, the immortality of\nAman. In 9 years, a vast fleet was made ready, and Pharazôn, almost\nwavering, boarded his flagship, Alcarondas, and set sail. 39 days later,\nNumenor met with apocalypse. The king had landed at Aman, and the Valar\nhad ceded guardianship of Arda to Eru. Eru tore Aman away from the\nworld, and formed the flat disc of Arda into a globe. Númenor was\nflooded, and its proud towers and walls crumbled. Sauron was taken\nunawares, and his last fair form was destroyed, and “as a gale” he\nescaped. Not all the Númenóreans were killed, however. Nine ships, led\nby Elendil son of Amandil escaped to the North of Middle-earth, and\nthere founded the kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor. The race of Black\nNúmenórean colonists existed far away in Harad still, as well as the\nrest of the Númenóreans' colonies.",

A good 600\nNúmenórean miles long, it began in the Ephel Dúath of Mordor and then\nflowed southwest for about 350 miles, when it bent west and sped to\nBelegaer, which it entered in a wide delta.

Although no cities or permanent\ndwellings of the Haradrim were described by Tolkien, it is presumable\nthey were located near these rivers, where the climate may have been\nmilder and where they could make use of irrigation."

    "text": "The AVARI were a branch of the Elves in Middle-earth. History When Oromë\nfound that Elves that awakened in Cuiviénen, he invited them to come\nwith him to Valinor. All the Minyar and most of the Tatyar and Nelyar\nwere persuaded and followed Oromë into the west on the Great Journey.\nThe remainder of the Tatyar and Nelyar remained suspicious of the Lords\nof the west, seeing them only in their wrath, or they simply refused to\ndepart from their own lands, and spread gradually throughout the wide\nlands of Middle-earth. They were after known in Quenya, the language of\nthe Eldar that eventually reached Valinor, by the name _Avari_, meaning\n“the Unwilling”, because they refused the summons. Having never come to\nValinor, the Avari remained wild folk, dwellers of forests. Little is\nknown of them, as they do not appear in any of the tales, save some\nreferences to Avari creeping in the south of Beleriand in the First Age.\nSome of them merged with the Nandor and Sindar in Eriador and the Vale\nof Anduin. Also, it is speculated that the Dark Elves were the first\nother sentient race encountered by the race of Men during their infancy.\nThe Dark Elves probably taught them many of the basic crafts of\ncivilization, though the craft of the Eldar surpassed that of the Avari\neven more than that of the Avari surpassed primitive Men. In _The War of\nthe Jewels_, names of six tribes of Avari in their own languages are\ngiven, all being cognates of the Quenya word Quendi (_the Speakers_):\nKINDI, CUIND, HWENTI, WINDAN, KINN-LAI, PENNI. They are the only certain\nAvarin words ever mentioned in the published Middle-earth material. It\nis speculated however that Dorwinion was an Avarin land, with WINION\ncarrying the meaning of “Wine”. The Silmarillion contains a suggestion\nthat orcs may be descended from Avarin elves captured and corrupted by\nMelkor. Eöl was called the 'Dark Elf' for he shuns the daylight,\npreferring to stay within the dark woods of Nan Elmoth and walk under\nthe moon and starlights but he is not of Avari origin for he is a kin of\nThingol. His roots lies with the Teleri, who did not go to Aman, later\ncalled the Sindarin under the rule of Thingol and Melian the Maia. Other\nversions of the legendarium In older versions of the legendarium, the\nname _Avari_ was originally that of the later Eldar, then meaning “those\nthat departed”. In other, relatively late writings, a brief idea was\nthat the Avari did not come from the three clans, but from two other\nclans, led by Nurwë and Morwë. This idea was later dropped. In the final\nconception, the elves were divided into three tribes."

The triangle between\nthe Isen and Adorn rivers and the White Mountains was a contested area\nbetween the Rohirrim and the Dunlendings. The ancient Great Road which\nconnected the realms of Gondor and Arnor of old ran through the Gap,\ncrossing the Isen at the _Fords of Isen_.

    "text": "_THE LETTERS OF J. R. R. TOLKIEN_ (ISBN 0-618-05699-8) is a collection\npublished in 1981 of 354 selected letters written by J.R.R. Tolkien over\nthe course of his lifetime, which were edited where necessary by\nTolkien's biographer Humphrey Carpenter with the help of his son\nChristopher Tolkien. The selection contains 354 letters dates between\nOctober 1914 when Tolkien was an undergraduate at Oxford and August 29\n1973 four days before his death. The book is now published by George\nAllen and Unwin (UK) and Houghton Mifflin (US). Formation of the Book\nHumphrey Carpenter first collected and transcribed all the letters and\nmade the initial selection based upon that. Then Christopher Tolkien\ncommented upon his work and made various suggestions for changes, which\nwhere then discussed among them and adopted with various emendations.\nThey then found it necessary to reduce the text quite severely for\nconsideration of space. Humphrey then proposed the initial cuts on which\nChristopher again made various suggestions after which they came up with\na final procedure which was needed in order to make this collection\nhappen. The collection of letters therefore reflects Humphrey tastes and\njudgement more then that of Christopher. Even though it is still their\njoined work. Contents of the Collection - Introduction - Letters of\nJ.R.R. Tolkien - Notes - Index Types of Letters The 354 letters can be\nroughly divided into four categories: - Personal letters to his family,\nnamely to his wife Edith Tolkien, his son Christopher Tolkien and all\nhis other children and even some grandchildren. - Letters concerning his\ncareer as a professor of Anglo-Saxon - Letters send to his publishers\nAllen & Unwin explaining his often continued failing to meet deadlines\nand other topics related to publishing a book and - Letters about\nMiddle-earth, this category is for obvious reasons the most interesting\nto Tolkien fans as it provides a lot of information about Middle-earth\nwhich at the time of publishing could not anywhere else in the then\npublished works by Tolkien himself and his then posthumously published\nwork by his son Christopher. Interesting examples In letters 29 & 30, we\nfind out that a German translation of _The Hobbit_ was being negotiated\nin 1938. The German firm inquired whether Tolkien was of 'arisch'\n(Aryan) origin. Tolkien was infuriated by this, and wrote two letters as\na response. In the first one Tolkien apparently refused to give any\ndeclaration whatsoever of his origin and in the second one he proudly\nprotested on the inquiry and, among other things, replied that “... I\nregret that I appear to have _no_ ancestors of that gifted people”. He\ngave his editor the choice on which reply to use. This second letter is\nthe only one preserved and it is probable that the first one was sent."

The Gulf started at the southern end of Beleriand,\nand from there flowed east all the way to where later was south Gondor,\nwhere a narrow strip of land separated it from the Sea of Helcar. North\nof the Great Gulf lay the lands of Beleriand and Eriador, south of it\nlay those lands which later would be known as Far Harad.

    "text": "DUNLENDINGS, also known as WILDMEN OF DUNLAND, were the people of\nDunland. They were known as a fierce culture of Men who sought vengeance\non the people of Rohan who, as Saruman rightly said, drove them into the\nmountains. In _The Two Towers_, Saruman used their anger to manipulate\nand convince them to destroy the land of Rohan during the War of the\nRing. He sends them across Rohan, burning and looting the land.\nDunlending Wildmen come from the land of Dunland. When looting Rohan\nearlier in the Third Age, they are led by a Dunlending named Wulf son of\nFreca. History In the years of the Second Age before the Númenóreans\nsettled in Middle-earth, the tribal Hill-men inhabited the lands west\nand south of the Misty Mountains, as far down as the valleys surrounding\nthe White Mountains. Wary of the men who came out of the west, they came\nto fear and hate them. They were hunted and persecuted in such numbers\nthat they had dwindled by the start of the Third Age. At this time they\nhad come to congregate in the valleys of the White Mountains and the\ngrassy plains of Dunland, which lay west of the Misty Mountains between\nMoria and Isengard; a few went north, and became the ancestors of the\nMen of Bree. Dunland then became the area most populated by these men,\nwho came to be called Dunlendings. When Eorl and his people were granted\nCalenardhon --- Rohan, as it would later be known --- in TA 2510, they\ndrove the Wild Men from their new lands, earning their bitter hatred and\nenmity. The Wild Men were also driven from the White Mountains by the\nMen of Gondor. During the next five hundred years these shorter,\ndark-haired warriors made frequent attacks upon the outlying settlements\nof Rohan, exacting revenge upon the usurpers, whom they called\n“straw-heads” because of the high number of blond warriors among them.\nAs a consequence, Rohan maintained patrols and garrisons to the west of\nthe Fords of Isen to try to limit the number of raids, although these\npatrols had virtually disappeared under Wormtongue's stewardship, to the\npoint where Saruman's forces could make incursions almost at will. Yet\nnot everybody took against the Wild Men. At some point near the end of\nthe thirtieth century of the Third Age, Saruman made contact with them\nand swayed them to his side by playing on their resentment and hatred of\nthose who had taken what was theirs. Saruman welcomed to Orthanc a large\nwarband of these Dunlendings. Saruman evidently convinced them that they\ncould reclaim what had been taken, and during the early part of TA 3019,\na fearsome raiding force comprising Dunlendings, Orcs and Uruk-hai left\nIsengard and began ravaging the western settlements of Rohan. Previous\nattacks by Orcs and Uruk-hai had killed many Rohirrim at the Fords of\nIsen, so there were no warriors to defend against the surprise attack.\nMany people of Rohan were killed in these attacks, but the raiders never\nmade it across the country to Edoras; it is fair to assume that they\nencountered one or more Éoreds, companies of mounted warriors, who would\nhave been patrolling the interior. After the defeat of Isengard at the\nBattle of the Hornburg, the Rohirrim spared the surviving Dunlendings\nand used them as workmen to repair the broken walls of the Hornburg. The\nRohirrim's mercy surprised the Dunlendings, as Saruman had convinced\nthem the Rohirrim would slaughter them all if given the chance. When\nGandalf, Frodo Baggins, Sam Gamgee, Merry Brandybuck, and Pippin Took\nwere traveling through Dunland on their way back towards the the Shire,\nthe Dunlendings in that area hid from them. After the War of the Ring,\nthe Dunlendings sent ambassadors to the court of King Aragorn, thus\nfinally began peace and diplomacy between Gondor and Rohan with the\nDunlending realms. Culture The Dunlendings were hill-folk used to living\nin harsh conditions, often seen in leather garb and fur cloaks. They may\nhave been related to the Snowmen of Forochel in the north. They were a\ntough, hardy people, big and powerful with long, unkempt hair and\nbeards. The Dunlendings, because they lived in the hilly and forested\narea of Dunland, most likely hunted, foraged, and fished for food, with\nagriculture being a lesser form of food production. The Dunlendings, due\nto their way of life, probably were very skilled with bows. Dunlendings\nare also described as using cavalry at the Fords of Isen. Most\nDunlendings probably fought, however, on foot, with long spears, axes\nand other melee weapons (as with most self-arming forces, swords were\nexpensive and therefore a rarity).  Armour for most soldiers was light,\nbut well-off warriors and chieftains likely made use of chainmail and\nwere clad similarly as their Rohirrim counterparts.",

The full extent of Belegaer\nafter the Akallabêth is never made clear, but it reached far enough to\nthe north that parts were covered in ice, and far down into the heats of\nthe south. Before the Second Age, the Belegaer stretched from the Gap of\nIlmen in the far north, to where it connected to Ilmen and froze in the\nfar south. Belegaer was more narrow in the north than in the south, with\nits widest part located near the Girdle of Arda. History Before the\nChange of the World Before Melkor's destruction of the Two Lamps, the\nBelegaer did not exist as there was only a great land mass and Almaren\nin the Great Lake. After which, the Belegaer began as a large body of\nwater lying between Aman and Middle-earth. It remained unchanged until\nthe War for Sake of the Elves during the Years of the Trees, when the\nBelegaer grew wider and deeper and less evenly displaced. After the war,\nUlmo pulled the willing Elves on the isle of Tol Eressëa across the\nBelegaer to their new home in Aman. The continent of Aman, the home of\nthe Valar, formed the western edge of Belegaer. Before the ruin of\nBeleriand at the end of the First Age, the sea was narrow and covered\nwith ice in the north, forming the harsh strait of Helcaraxë. The\nrebelling Ñoldor fleeing Valinor crossed to Middle-earth by ship and by\nway of the dangerous ice crossings on the Helcaraxë. Fëanor's host\ncrossed by ship along the coasts while Fingolfin's host made the\ndifficult journey, coming up from Aman along the shoreline and across\nthe ices of the Helcaraxë. When the Valar declared war on Morgoth's\ntyranny in Middle-earth, the host was ferried across the Belegaer by the\nSwanfleet's of the Falmari. After the War of Wrath, the Belegaer was\nwidened again by the drowning of the Beleriand in Middle-earth. The\nHelcaraxë in the north was removed, ending all land access to the\nUndying Lands. After the Changing of the World During the Akallabêth in\nthe later Second Age, Eru “bent” the sea and made the world round.

Etymology _Belegaer_ is of\nthe Sindarin words 'beleg' which meant 'mighty' and 'aer' or e_är_,\nmeaning 'sea' (which is also present in the name _Eärendil_). The Quenya\nname of Belegaer, never used in published writing, is _Alatairë_.\nNotable features Islands - Tol Eressëa - Enchanted Isles seaward of Tol\nEressëa - Númenor (Second Age only) - Tol Morwen - Tol Fuin - Himling -\nBalar (First Age only) - Tolfalas, in the Bay of Belfalas Bodies of\nwater - Bay of Eldamar - Bay of Balar (First Age only) - The Great Gulf\n(First Age only) - Firth of Drengist (First Age only) - Ice-Bay of\nForochel (after First Age) - Gulf of Lune (after First Age) - Bay of\nBelfalas (after First Age)",

Many years later a group of Nandor under\nDenethor, son of Lenwë, hearing of a great Elven realm crossed the Blue\nMountains into the Ossiriand, which was after named Lindon, or _Land of\nthe singers_, after these elves. After their settlement, they became\nknown as the Laiquendi, the Green Elves.

In\nMiddle-earth, they were known to dwell in the Old Forest and in Fangorn\nForest. History and Origin Among the most ancient of the Olvar that\nlived within Arda were the trees of the Great Forests that came from the\nseeds that Yavanna devised during the Age of the Lamps. For many ages\nthey grew peacefully, but in Middle-earth at the beginning of the Ages\nof the Stars there came among the trees great spirits later known as\nEnts. These protectors appeared because many other races in that time\ncame into the world and Yavanna feared that the forests would be\ndestroyed. So through the Ages of the Stars and Sun, the Ents walked the\nforests, and in time it is said some Ents became more tree-like and the\nancient trees became more Ent-like and limb-lithe. Like Ents, they\nlearned the Art of Speech. Whether tree or Ent in the beginning, by the\nThird Age of the Sun they were a race apart, referred to as _Huorns_.\nThe Huorns mostly stood as dark trees in the deepest forests, gnarled\nand unmoving, yet watchful. When aroused in wrath they moved swiftly as\nif wrapped in shadows, falling on foes with deadly and merciless\nstrength. The tale of the War of the Ring tells of how, with the Ents,\nthe Huorns marched on Isengard like a great forest, and how, under the\ndirection of the Ents, they exterminated the entire Orc legion in the\nBattle of the Hornburg. Huorns were ancient and long-brooding, and some\nwere said to be black-hearted and rotten. At least one such sentient\ntree spirit inhabited the Old Forest by the banks of the Withywindle\nRiver, who was called Old Man Willow. As the Old Forest and Fangorn were\nthe last remnants of the most ancient forests in Middle-earth, Old Man\nWillow wished to prevent further inroads into his realm. He held all the\nOld Forest in an enchantment by the power of his song and led all\ntravellers to him, where with his limb-lithe roots and branches he\nconsumed them. In _The Two Towers,_ the Huorns are witnessed to march to\nIsengard with the Ents. After Isengard is harrowed of its orcs, most of\nthe Huorns chased and killed them after the Battle of the Hornburg.\nAfter this brief appearance, the Huorns went back into the forests. The\ntactics used by the Huorns were quite effective, as they only attacked\nwhen all the enemy Orcs would be in their midst, denying the orcs chance\nof escape. It is notable that Huorns seemed to have the ability to cloak\nthemselves in shadows, becoming almost undetectable at night."

    "text": "WOOD-ELVES, or SILVAN ELVES, were a class of Elves that lived near the\nBlue Mountains. They were added to the number of High Elves, and they\nshared the lands with the Dwarves. The best known Wood-elves are the\nElves of the Woodland Realm in Northern Mirkwood and Lothlórien. In the\nFirst Age the elves of Ossiriand, the Laiquendi, were also referred to\nas Wood-elves. Silvan Elves were of Nandorin descent but they were\nmainly governed by Sindar and Noldorin rulers. Examples of such rulers\nwere Thranduil, the King of the Woodland Realm in Northern Mirkwood,\nAmdír and his son, Amroth, who ruled over Lothlórien, and Celeborn, who\ntoo ruled over Lothlórien with his wife Galadriel who was a Ñoldor elf.\nSilvan Elves were considered to be less wise than other Eldar, but were\nmore wise than men. Some of them were almost indistinguishable from the\nAvari, those who never joined the Great Journey. Mirkwood The Silvan\nElves of Mirkwood (formerly known as Greenwood the Great) were known to\nbe distrustful of Dwarves but friendly to Men, with whom they\ntrade. Mirkwood had been called Greenwood the Great until around the\nyear TA 1050, when the shadow of the Dark Lord Sauron fell upon it, and\nmen began to call it Mirkwood. During his journey to the Lonely\nMountain, Bilbo Baggins had to rescue the Dwarves of Thorin II\nOakenshield's company from these Elves. These Elves were also one of the\narmies in the Battle of the Five Armies. Legolas of the Fellowship of\nthe Ring, although he lived among them and presented himself as one of\nthe Silvan folk, was not one of them. As a son of the\nElven-king Thranduil, who had originally come from Doriath, Legolas was\nactually at least half of Sindarin heritage on his father's side (his\nmother's identity is unknown, though it is likely she was of Silvan\nbackground). This was complicated by the fact that a small minority of\nSindarin Elves ruled the predominantly Silvan Woodland Realm of Northern\nMirkwood, a minority to which Legolas belonged. The Sindarin minority in\nthat realm, who should have been nobler and wiser than the Silvan Elves,\ncould be seen as having “gone native” at the end of the First Age\nafter Morgoth was defeated and all the grand elf kingdoms of Beleriand\nwere destroyed. In the cartoon version of _The Hobbit_, they have been\ndepicted as having green skin and brown clothes which were very\nprimitive in comparison to the other elves portrayed in the movie.\nLórien The Silvan Elves of Lórien were known as part of the Galadhrim,\nliterally “tree-folk”. However, the Galadhrim of Lorien also included a\nmixture of elves of Nandor, Noldor, and Sindar descent. Galadriel was of\nNoldor descent, being the daughter of Finarfin, while Celeborn was of\nSindarin descent of the Kingdom of Doriath. At the time of the War of\nthe Ring they spoke an accent or dialect of Sindarin which had changed\nso much that Frodo Baggins, who spoke Sindarin, could not understand\nthem. Additionally, few Elves of Lórien could speak Westron, so that\nHaldir, one of the few that could, had to accompany them on their way to\nCaras Galadhon. Haldir has been speculated to be a Sindarin Elf, but\nthere is no absolute evidence to confirm this. The only evidence is that\nhe shares the white blond hair of Thranduil and Legolas, who themselves\nare Sindarin."

They thus abandoned the Great Journey, choosing instead to\nremain in those wide forests, where they became a scattered people.\nLittle is known of the wanderings of the Nandor, save that they spread\nthroughout the Vales of Anduin over a period of many centuries, some\nfollowing the Great River southward, eventually settling at the Mouths\nof Anduin or instead turning north again into Eriador, where eventually\nDenethor gathered as many as he could and crossed the Blue Mountains\ninto Beleriand. These were later known as the Green-Elves of Ossiriand,\nand were welcomed by Thingol as long lost kin. Some of the Nandor\nhowever stayed in the forested Vales, and these would become the Silvan\nElves - hidden away in their woodland fastnesses and were to their\nestranged kin hardly distinguishable from the Avari, and indeed\nsometimes living in friendship with them. Their language had diverged to\nsuch an extent that it was barely intelligible to the Sindar and Noldor\nwhen these met the Silvan Elves again in the Second Age, though the\nlanguages were found to be obviously related. It was not until this\nrenewed contact between the kindreds and the guidance of the Sindar and\nNoldor that the Silvan Elves again became an organised people and\nincreased in wisdom. This however also led to the Silvan tongue being\nlargely forgotten, Sindarin instead becoming the primary spoken language\nby the end of the Third Age, with the Silvan dialects only surviving in\nseveral names of places and persons. The renewed contact was caused by\nthe destruction of Beleriand after the War of Wrath, for when the Second\nAge was young, the Silvan Elves welcomed those survivors of the calamity\nwho rather than crossing the Sea rejoined their kindred east of the\nMisty Mountains. Indeed soon many of the Silvan Elves came to be ruled\nby these Sindar refugees, primarily in Lothlórien and the Woodland\nRealm. The Woodland Realm The primarily Silvan Elves of Mirkwood were\nknown to be distrustful of Dwarves but friendly to Men, with whom they\ntraded. Mirkwood had been called Greenwood the Great until around the\nyear TA 1050, when the shadow of the Dark Lord Sauron fell upon it, and\nmen began to call it Mirkwood. During his journey to the Lonely\nMountain, Bilbo Baggins had to rescue the Dwarves of Thorin II\nOakenshield's company from these Elves. These Elves sent hosts to both\nthe War of the Last Alliance and the Battle of the Five Armies. Legolas\nof the Fellowship of the Ring, although he lived among them was not\ntruly one of the Silvan folk. As a son of the Elven-king Thranduil,\nwhose father Oropher had originally come from Doriath, Legolas was\nlikely actually at least half of Sindarin heritage on his father's side\n(his mother's identity being unknown). It is important to note that\nwhile by the end of the Third Age, Sindarin had become the primary\nlanguage of the Woodland Realm, Silvan being almost completely\nforgotten, that in the early years of the Sindarin rule over the Silvan\nElves here, the Sindar for a time “deliberately” adopted the language\nand customs of the Silvan Elves, as “they wished to return to the simple\nlife natural to the elves before the invitation of the Valar had\ndisturbed it”. Lórien The Silvan Elves of Lórien were the larger part of\nthe Galadhrim or the Tree-people, who were a mixture of elves of Nandor,\nNoldor, and Sindar descent. Most of the Sindar that came to Lórien were\nrefugees from Beleriand, arriving early in the Second Age, and the Sinda\nAmdír became the King of Lórien. After Amdír was killed in the Battle of\nDagorlad, his son Amroth became King. After the destruction of Eregion,\nthey were joined by many Sindarin speaking Noldor, led by Galadriel and\nCeleborn, who fled to Lórien through Moria. Galadriel was of Noldor\ndescent, being the daughter of Finarfin, while Celeborn was of Sindarin\ndescent of the Kingdom of Doriath. When Amroth was lost in the Third\nAge, Galadriel and Celeborn became known as the Lady and Lord of Lórien,\nbut neither of them took the vacant Kingship. At the time of the War of\nthe Ring they spoke an accent or dialect of Sindarin which had changed\nso much that Frodo Baggins, who spoke some Sindarin, could not\nunderstand them. Additionally, few elves of Lórien could speak Westron,\nso that Haldir, one of the few that could, had to accompany them on\ntheir way to Caras Galadhon."

The Doom of Mandos was placed on them so that\nthey could not return to Valinor. History The Exiles were split into two\ngroups during the Kinslaying at Alqualondë; Fëanor and his sons and\nfollowers took the ships they had acquired from the Teleri, leaving\nFingolfin's followers behind. They had to cross the Helcaraxë in the\nnorth, and lost a large number of people there. When asked about the\ncourse of action they would take to transport the rest of the exiles,\nFëanor ordered the burning of the ships. Morgoth wasted no time\nattacking the exiles, which were vastly superior to them in spite of\ntheir small number and unprepared state. Fingolfin and his followers\narrived at the same time as the Moon first rose, and they mainly settled\nin Hithlum. The Exiles set up kingdoms in various places and joined\nothers. Amrod and Amras joined the Laiquendi of Ossiriand, Finrod built\nNargothrond and Minas Tirith, and Turgon built Gondolin. For hundreds of\nyears, the Ñoldor held off the forces of Morgoth, defeating him in three\nof the major battle of Beleriand and laying siege to his great abode in\nthe north. However, in FA 455 Morgoth broke the siege, and the Ñoldor\nbegan losing ground. About seventeen years later they lost a critical\nbattle and many subsequently enslaved. The majority of the survivors\nwere forced to relocate farther into the south with further hurt coming\nto them by infighting between them caused by the Sons of Fëanor.\nEventually, all the great realms occupied by the exiles fell by the year\nFA 510 with all survivors fleeing to the Havens of Sirion, which had\nbecame their chief colony. More conflict assailed them when again the\nSons of Fëanor attacked and killed many of their kin. One of their\nresidents raised there was Eärendil who built Vingilot allowing him to\nescape the carnage. Joined by his wife, they both won through to Valinor\nby the light of the Silmaril. There they pleaded with the Valar for aid\nand forgiveness for the rebellion of the Ñoldor. After the Morgoth was\ndefeated in the War of Wrath, the Doom was lifted and many of the\nÑoldorin Exiles went back to the Undying Lands save for Galadriel and\nthe Ñoldor who followed Celebrimbor."

    "text": "The LAIQUENDI (Quenya; IPA: ; singular LAIQUENDË; ) also known as the\nGREEN-ELVES were a group of Nandor under Denethor, son of Lenwë. These\nelves passed westward into the Beleriand over the Blue Mountains and\ncame to reside in Ossiriand, the _Land of Seven Rivers,_ and were quite\nsecretive there. Culture The Laiquendi had vast knowledge of nature and\npreferred living in forests besides waterfalls and streams, probably\nliving off of simple hunting and gathering. They made no weapons of\nsteel, had only bows and arrows - which they were experts at handling.\nThey dressed in forest-like green attire during the spring and summer\nmonths, therefore becoming known as the Green-elves. They were also fond\nof singing during the daylight hours. Their culture remained unique and\ndistinct for many hundreds of years as they were for the most part a\nsimple, peaceful, and reclusive people. History The Laiquendi can be\ntraced to the Telerin Elves of the host of Olwë, who coming upon the\nGreat River Anduin and seeing the seemingly impassable peaks of the\nMisty Mountains, forsook the westward journey and became a separated\npeople. These Elves followed Lenwë down the banks of the Anduin and once\nagain became separated. The fate of many of these elves is uncertain;\nwhat is certain though is that some wandered into Eriador making contact\nwith the Dwarves, probably learning from them about the great Sindarin\nKing Thingol ruling peaceful territories in the rich lands of the\nBeleriand, prompting them to cross the Blue Mountains. Following their\nKing Denethor, they made permanent settlement in the Ossiriand, which\nwas after named Lindon, or _Land of the singers_ after these elves. They\nquickly made friends with Thingol, who recognized them as long lost kin\nof old. Morgoth, returning to Middle-earth with the Silmarils before his\npursuers the Ñoldor, quickly occupied his strongholds of old in the far\nnorth and resumed his plans for conquest. He invaded the Beleriand.\nSeeking aid, Thingol called on the Laiquendi and Denethor answered\nleading an army against their enemy’s eastern host, but were driven off\nand surrounded at Amon Ereb before they could be rescued by Thingol's\narmy. Their simplistic weapons were little to no match for the servants\nand beasts of Morgoth, thus they suffered heavy losses and Denethor was\nslain. Afterwards they became a secretive people never again naming a\nlord or a king and played no further part in the Battles of the\nBeleriand again, until the latter days of Beren and Lúthien. When Menhad\nbegun migrating west looking for new lands, the Laiquendi feared them\ngreatly and hid themselves away threatening to attack them if Finrod\ndidn’t lead them away from the Ossiriand. They are not mentioned again\nin the First Age until the later days of Beren and Lúthien who lived in\ntheir lands on Tol Galen between the river Adurant. They had a great\nrespect for them and their friendship with Beren led them to take up\narms for one last time when they helped him and his son ambush the\nDwarves who sacked Menegroth. After the destruction of the Beleriand,\nthe surviving Laiquendi merged with the Elves of Lindon and the peoples\nof the Elven realms of Lothlórien and Mirkwood over the next few ages.\nEtymology _LAIQUENDI_ is a Quenyan word that meant “Green-elves”.

They awoke at Cuiviénen on the\ncontinent of Middle-earth (see: Awakening of the Elves), where they were\ndivided into three tribes: the Minyar (Vanyar), the Tatyar (Ñoldor), and\nthe Nelyar (Teleri). After some time, they were summoned by Oromë to\nlive with the Valar in Aman. That summons and the Great Journey that\nfollowed split the Elves into two main groups (and many minor ones), who\nwere never fully reunited. The name QUENDI refers to _all_ elves.\nHistory Avari The AVARI are _Those who Refused the Summons_ of Oromë, or\nsimply _The Unwilling_. (Most of the Avari came from the largest tribe,\nthe Teleri. A few of the Ñoldor remained as well, but were no longer\ncalled by that tribal name.) Together with the Nandor and the Sindar,\nthey are called the MORIQUENDI (_Elves of Darkness_) in recognition of\nthe fact that they did not see the light of the Two Trees. While all of\nthe Eldar departed Middle-earth by the early Fourth Age, it appears that\nthe Avari mostly stayed. Eldar The ELDAR are those who accepted the\nsummons. Their name, literally _Star People_, was given to them by Oromë\nin their own language. Those of the Lindar who undertook the Great\nJourney were called the Teleri. - Those of the Teleri who refused to\ncross the Misty Mountains, and stayed in the valley of Anduin, are\ncalled the NANDOR (_Valley People_). - Those of the Nandor who left the\nAnduin under the leadership of Denethor and came to Beleriand are called\nthe LAIQUENDI (_Green Elves_). - The other Nandor became known as the\nSILVAN ELVES, living in the forests of Wilderland. Some of the Avari\njoined them there. - Those of the Teleri who reached Beleriand by the\nGreat Sea but chose not to cross to Aman were called the SINDAR (_Grey\nPeople_). - Many of the Teleri chose to remain behind in order to look\nfor their lord Thingol, who disappeared near the end of the journey.\nThese were known as the EGLATH (_Forsaken_), because they were left\nbehind when their kindred crossed the Sea. - Those of the Teleri who\ncame to the shores of the Great Sea but decided to stay there are called\nthe FALATHRIM (_People of the Shore_). - The Vanyar, the Ñoldor, and\nthose of the Teleri who stayed with them to the end are called the\nCALAQUENDI (_Elves of Light_) because they saw the Two Trees. The rest\nof the Teleri are also sometimes counted among the Moriquendi. - Most of\nthe Ñoldor returned with Fëanor to Middle-earth, and at least some of\nthese remained there through the Third Age.

    "text": "_THE BOOK OF LOST TALES PART TWO_ (also abbreviated _THE BOOK OF LOST\nTALES 2_ or _THE BOOK OF LOST TALES II_) (ISBN 0-395-36614-3) is the\nsecond part of Christopher Tolkien's 13-volume series _The History of\nMiddle-earth_, in which he analyses the unpublished manuscripts of his\nfather J.R.R. Tolkien. It follows, and is always published separately\nfrom, Part One. Content _The Book of Lost Tales_ contains the first\nversions of the stories which would later become _The Silmarillion_, and\nis notable because, while very primitive in style and content, it is\nvery close to the later work in many ways. Each of the Tales is followed\nby notes and a detailed commentary by Christopher Tolkien. While many of\nthe names in the book are identical or close to those in the later\nversions, some of them bear almost no resemblance to their final forms.\nJ.R.R. Tolkien emended names of characters and places rather frequently,\nsometimes with several new variants (rejected in turn) written in a\nsingle manuscript. Confusingly, sometimes the name applied to one thing\nis later used to refer to a different thing, the original use abandoned.\nAs an example, the house of Elves called “Teleri” in _The Book of Lost\nTales_ is not the same as that in _The Silmarillion_ (see Teleri). The\noriginal usage of “Teleri” would eventually change until the name became\n“Vanyar”. Meanwhile, the house of Elves called “Solosimpi” would inherit\nthe name “Teleri”. The framework for the book is that a mortal Man\nvisits the Isle of Tol Eressëa, where the Elves live. In the earlier\nversions of the “Lost Tales” this man is named Eriol, of some vague\nnorth European origin, but in later versions he becomes Ælfwine, an\nEnglishman of the Middle-ages. There are more changes visible within the\nbook, and it is not internally consistent, partially because even while\nstill writing it Tolkien began rewriting earlier parts as his ideas\nabout the world changed. The Tales were eventually abandoned, but they\nwere resurrected in part as the “Sketch of the Mythology” which would\nbecome _The Silmarillion_. For publication the book was split into two\nvolumes: _The Book of Lost Tales Part One_ and _The Book of Lost Tales\nPart Two_, but this is simply an editorial division. Both volumes are\ncomprised of several “Lost Tales”, which can be considered as either\nchapters or simply “parts”. Table of Contents 1. “The Tale of Tinúviel”\n— the first version of the tale of Beren and Lúthien 2. “Turambar and\nthe Foalókë” — the first version of the Túrin saga 3. “The Fall of\nGondolin” — the full narrative of the Fall of Gondolin 4. “The\nNauglafring” — a story which was “lost” (in that it never was rewritten\nin full) and mostly excluded from the later _Silmarillion_. 5. “The Tale\nof Eärendel” — the only full narrative of Eärendil's travels 6. “The\nHistory of Eriol or Ælfwine and the End of the Tales” — an essay about\nthe changes in the framework, and the “unwritten” tales"

It is the\nsecond volume (_Morgoth's Ring_ being the first) that explores the later\n1951 _Silmarillion_ drafts, i.e. those which were written after the\ncompletion of _The Lord of the Rings_. This volume includes: - The\nsecond part of the 1951 _Silmarillion_ drafts - An expanded account of\nthe _Grey Annals_ the history of Beleriand after the coming of the\nElves. - Additional narratives involving Húrin and the tragedy of his\nchildren (see _Narn i Chîn Húrin_). “The Wanderings of Húrin” is the\nconclusion to the “_Narn_”. This was not included in the final\n_Silmarillion_ because Christopher Tolkien feared that the heavy\ncompression, which would have been necessary to make it, a stylistic\nmatch with the rest of the book would have been too difficult and would\nhave made the story overly complex and difficult to read. - Christopher\nTolkien's explanation of how he, with the collaboration of fantasy\nauthor Guy Gavriel Kay, constructed Chapter 22 of the Silmarillion,\nsince none of the texts left by Tolkien for this purpose were up-to-date\nenough to serve the purpose. In particular, the old texts all have\nThingol portrayed as a miserly swindler who cheats the Dwarves out of\ntheir payment, and the portrayal of the Girdle of Melian in the older\nstories is much weaker than the impenetrable barrier of the post-LOTR\nwritings. - “Quendi and Eldar”, which discusses in greater detail the\norigin of the Elves and their sunderings. - Tolkien's exploration of the\norigins of the Ents and the great Eagles Table of Contents - Part One:\nThe Grey Annals - Part Two: The Later Quenta Silmarillion - Part Two,\nchapter 1: “Of Men” - Part Two, chapter 2: “Of the Siege of Angband” -\nPart Two, chapter 3: “Of Beleriand and its Realms” - Part Two, chapter\n4: “Of Turgon and the Building of Gondolin” - Part Two, chapter 5:\n“Concerning the Dwarves” - Part Two, chapter 6: “Of the Coming of Men\ninto the West” - Part Two, chapter 7: “Of the Ruin of Beleriand and the\nFall of Fingolfin” - Part Two, chapter 8 (?) : “The Last Chapters” -\nPart Three: The Wanderings of Hurin and other writings not forming part\nof the _Quenta Silmarillion_ - Part Three, chapter 1: “The Wanderings of\nHúrin” - Part Three, chapter 2: “Ælfwine and Dirhaval” - Part Three,\nchapter 3: “Maeglin” - Part Three, chapter 4: “Of the Ents and the\nEagles” - Part Three, chapter 5: “The Tale of Years” - Part Four: Quendi\nand Eldar - Part Four: Index"

    "text": "The_' Haradrim, KNOWN IN WESTRON AS THE Southrons_' and once as the\n“SWERTINGS” by Hobbits, were a race of Men from Harad in the region of\nMiddle-earth directly south of Gondor. A part of the histories of the\nWestlands is given to the fierce people who in the Second and the Third\nAge of the Sun, came from the hot deserts and forests of sunlands, which\nlay in the South of Middle-earth. These people were ruled by many and\nlords, until in time Sauron the Maia corrupted them and called them to\nwar. History During the Second Age the Men of Númenor built a great city\nin the firth of Umbar, a vast natural harbour on the southern shores of\nthe Bay of Belfalas, eventually turning the city into a fortified\ncitadel from whose gates the Men of Númenor could levy great tributes\nupon many of the tribes of Harad. For many years, the Haradrim were the\ngreatest enemy of Gondor. Several times, they invaded the north.\nFinally, the Men of Gondor were able to capture Harad, though it was\nlater freed. During the War of the Ring the Haradrim were allied with\nSauron. A Haradrim warrior wounded Faramir. At the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields, the 18,000 Haradrim were a great threat to the Rohirrim\nthat had come to aid the people of Minas Tirith. During the onslaught a\nHaradrim chieftain, who bore the standard of a black serpent on a\nscarlet field, led the Haradrim cavalry. King Théoden of Rohan slew him\nin single combat. Once Sauron was destroyed, the Haradrim, Variags, and\nEasterlings disbanded from the Black Gates and out of Mordor, and became\ndispersed. Etymology The name _HARADRIM_ means “South-people”, from the\nSindarin _harad_ (“south”) and _rim_ (“host, group”). Other names were\nSOUTHERNS, SOUTHRONS. Traits and culture The Haradrim were bold and grim\nmen, fierce in despair. They were tall and dark-skinned with black hair\nand dark eyes, and for that they were called SWERTINGS or SWARTHY MEN.\nThe men of Near Harad were brown-skinned, with black hair and dark eyes,\nwhile the race known as “half-trolls” out of Far Harad had black skin.\nMany Haradrim warriors were seen in bright clothing, such as scarlet\nrobes, and were decorated with golden ornaments, such as collars,\nearrings, corsets of overlapping brazen plates; they braided their hair\nwith gold. Some tribes painted their bodies. Scarlet and red was also\nthe color of their banners, tips of their spears, and body paint. Their\nshields were yellow and black with spikes. It is also mentioned that at\nthe end of the Second Age some of the Men in the south had weapons of\niron. At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Haradrim bore scimitars\nthat glittered like stars. The Haradrim had tamed the massive _Mûmakil_\nbeasts and used them in warfare and, like their masters, were decorated\nwith scarlet and gold. They even strapped towers on their backs, used by\nHaradrim archers and spearmen. Harad's tribes included into those of\nNear and Far Harad, although there were many tribes of the Haradrim,\noften mutually hostile. Some of the peoples of Far Harad were organized\ninto kingdoms. Language To the Gondorians their voices sounded harsh,\nlike shouts of beasts. The only word which is stated to come from a\nsouthron language is “Mûmak”, the name of the great war-oliphaunts of\nHarad. Gandalf states that his name in “the south” is “Incánus” thought\n_Inkā-nūsh_ (or possibly _Inkā-nūs_), meaning “North-spy”. Despite\nhaving a meaning in Quenya (“fate”), the name Umbar is said to be\nadapted from the natives' language and not from Elvish or Adûnaic.\nEnvironment The lands of the Haradrim lie to the south of Gondor past\nthe river Poros. In the land south of Gondor, the sun beat down\nunrelentingly, cooking much of Haradwaith into desert. Military Tactics\nThe Haradrim are said to be skilled horsemen, though not near the\nprowess of the Rohirrim. They are known to have mounted champions and\narchers, as well as infantry. Horses fear the Mumakil, and so the\nSouthron forces often rally around them when faced with mounted foes.\nFuture of Harad Much of Harad's impressive army was wiped out on the\nexpanses of Pelennor Fields, during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.\nWith Sauron defeated, many Harad peoples sent emissaries to the court of\nKing Aragorn, and peace talks began; however, many other Haradrim tribes\ncontinued hostility with Gondor.",

Grishnákh is described in the book as “_a\nshort crook-legged creature, very broad and with long arms that hung\nalmost to the ground_” and as having a voice that was soft but\nevil-sounding. Biography Grishnákh's plans for the two captives, Merry\nand Pippin, were in conflict with Uglúk's orders to deliver them to\nSaruman unharmed. Grishnákh wanted to take them northward to the\neast-bank of the Great River where a Nazgûl atop a Fell beast would take\nthem to Barad-dûr. After Uglúk refused his plan, Grishnákh slipped away\nwhile the Orcs and Uruk-hai argued amongst each other. Grishnákh soon\nreturned with other Orcs like himself, Orcs with drooping arms and\nshields with the red eye painted on them. Grishnákh was somehow aware of\nthe existence of the One Ring (having been implied to have participated\nin the torture of Gollum), and suspected the two Hobbits of possessing\nit. When the Orcs holding the two Hobbits were attacked by the\nbanished Éomer's Rohirrim, Grishnákh used the distraction to search the\nHobbits for the Ring. Pippin tried to negotiate with Grishnákh, asking\nfor himself and Merry to be freed in exchange for information about the\nRing, but instead Grishnákh tried to carry them away. When it seemed a\nRohirrim rider had discovered him, Grishnákh drew his sword to kill the\nHobbits lest they be rescued or escape, but before he could act he was\nshot in the hand by a Rohirrim arrow and dropped the sword, at which\npoint he tried to run but was ridden down and run through with\na Rohirrim spear.",

Biography The Great Goblin was a Goblin chieftain of the Misty\nMountains. He was a very large creature with a huge head. He was the\nchief of a group of goblins who lived in Goblin-town near the High Pass.\nThey preyed on travellers who used another, easier pass near the main\ngate of Goblin-town until people started avoiding that route over the\nmountains. The goblins then made another gate that opened into a cave\nthat they called the Front Porch, at the top of the High Pass. The Great\nGoblin also sometimes ordered his goblins to catch fish for him in\nGollum's Lake, and these goblins were sometimes killed by Gollum. In the\nsummer of TA 2941, the Dwarves of Thorin and Company, along with Bilbo\nBaggins, were captured on the Front Porch and were brought before the\nGreat Goblin in his great cave, where he was seated on a flat stone and\nsurrounded by armed guards. The Great Goblin demanded to know what the\nDwarves were doing in the mountains. (He seems less hostile in this\npassage than the Orcs are during the later War of the Ring, as his\nquestioning seems to imply that he has not decided beforehand whether he\nwill order the party killed, make them slaves, or even let them go, but\nthat he will decide according to their answers. It is also possible he\nwas just toying with the group and would kill them afterwards.) When it\nwas revealed that Thorin carried the Elvish sword Orcrist - which the\nOrcs and goblins fear and which they called “Biter” - the Great Goblin\nwas enraged and at once leapt to attack Thorin. Immediately, all the\ntorches in the cave were extinguished and a glowing sword “bright as\nblue flame” appeared. It was Glamdring, called “Beater” by the goblins,\nand now wielded by Gandalf. As the Dwarves were escaping, the Great\nGoblin leapt down in front of them, and attacked Gandalf who was at the\nhead of the party. Gandalf then fought back, stabbing the Great Goblin\nand killing him. The death of the Great Goblin angered the goblins of\nthe Misty Mountains. A great army of goblins and Wargs was amassed by\nBolg, whose father Azog had been killed by the dwarf Dáin II Ironfoot.\nBolg's forces tracked Thorin and Company to the Lonely Mountain where\nthey fought in the Battle of the Five Armies against the Dwarves, Elves,\nand Lakemen.",

    "page_id": "2269",
    "text": "RANGERS OF THE NORTH, or simply THE RANGERS, were the northern wandering\npeople of Eriador, the last remnant of the Dúnedain of Arnor, who had\nonce peopled the North Kingdom of Arnor. They protected the lands they\nwandered although their secretiveness made other peoples consider them\ndangerous and distrustful in Bree and the Shire, where they were known\nas “Watchers”. They were grim in appearance and were usually dressed in\ngrey or dark green, with a cloak-clasp shaped like a 6-pointed star. The\nterm 'Rangers of the North' was used most often by those who lived in\nthe southern lands of Rohan and Gondor, perhaps to distinguish this\npeople from their distant cousins, the Rangers of Ithilien. Like the\nRangers of the North, these were also Dúnedain, but they belonged to the\nSouth-kingdom of Gondor, and their ancestors had been divided from the\nNorthern Dúnedain for some three thousand years. Background The Dúnedain\nof Arnor dwindled after the breaking of Arnor into three kingdoms and\nthe wars with Angmar. Cardolan and Rhudaur soon fell and only the\npetty-kingdom of Arthedain maintained the noble line of Isildur.\nFinally, that too was destroyed in the Battle of Fornost and Arvedui,\nthe last King of Arthedain was lost in the sea. Arvedui's son and heir,\nAranarth claimed the title of the Chieftain, who would rule the remnants\nof his people. Elrond had in his keeping the heirlooms of the house of\nIsildur: the shards of Narsil, the Star of Elendil, the Sceptre of\nAnnúminas and later the Ring of Barahir, ransomed from the Lossoth. Each\nof Aranarth's heirs (who, like him, could trace his descent back to\nIsildur himself) would be secretly born and raised in Rivendell. The\nRangers became a secretive wandering and nomadic people around Eriador,\nfar from Sauron's spies, little known or remembered, and their deeds\nwere seldom recorded. History The Watchful Peace followed the loss of\nArnor and after its end, the enemies concentrated mostly against\nRhovanion and Gondor. During that time, the Rangers fought minor battles\nand skirmishes against orcs and wolves in order to keep the region safe.\nThe hobbits of the Shire flourished under their protection. During the\nrule of Arassuil, the Orcs of the Misty Mountains became more bold,\ndaring to invade Eriador. The Rangers fought many battles trying to hold\nthem back, but one party managed to reach the Shire, and were fought off\nby a party of brave Hobbits under Bandobras Took in T.A. 2747. Soon\nafter, the Long Winter arrived and many lives were lost, and Gandalf and\nthe Rangers had to help the Hobbits of the Shire survive. In 2911,\nduring Argonui's rule, the Fell Winter began with the Brandywine\nfreezing over. This was a catalyst for White Wolves invading Eriador\nfrom the North which must have harassed the Rangers. In the last year of\nhis reign, great floods devastated Enedwaith and Minhiriath leaving\nTharbad ruined and deserted. The following years were peaceful although\nArador was killed by hill-trolls and his son Arathorn II was killed\nwhile hunting orcs. Arathorn's son, Aragorn II succeeded him, who\nbetween 2957 to 2980 took great journeys, serving in the armies of King\nThengel of Rohan, and Steward Ecthelion II of Gondor. Many of his tasks\nweakened Sauron and his allies, and the West endured him during the War\nof the Ring. At that time Aragorn's Rangers were scattered and\ndiminished. When Halbarad led a troop of the Rangers into the south to\nAragorn's aid in the War, in haste he could muster no more than thirty\nin this company who fought in the Battle of Pelennor Fields. Aragorn\neventually became King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom and the Rangers\nbecame once more a united people under the line of Elendil in the Fourth\nAge. For over a thousand years, the Rangers of the North faithfully\npreserved the Line of Elendil and the ways of the Dúnedain and the\nancient heirlooms of the Heir of Isildur such as the Shards of Narsil,\nStar of Elendil, Sceptre of Annúminas, and the Ring of Barahir. Like all\nDúnedain, they were very friendly with the Elves, particularly those of\nRivendell, where each heir would be born and raised. They secretly\nguarded and protected Eriador, from spies and invaders, brigands, and\nother worse foes. At the time of the War of the Ring, the Rangers of the\nNorth were led by Aragorn, future king of the reunited kingdoms of\nGondor and Arnor. But despite Aragorn's leadership, most of the Rangers\nremained scattered and diminished. Therefore, when the ranger Halbarad\nendeavored to aid Aragorn in the War, he could muster only a small\nnumber of Rangers to join him."

    "text": "SCATHA was one of the greatest of the Long-worms that infested the Grey\nMountains in the north of Middle-earth. Biography Of his life, little is\nknown. However it is possible that Scatha was a remnant of the dragons\nof Morgoth that fled into Northeast after the War of Wrath at the end of\nthe First Age. It is not certain whether Scatha was the dragon which\nkilled Dain I and his son Frór. He appeared in the Third Age, and his\nlair was in the southern slopes of the Grey Mountains. He greatly\ntroubled the Dwarves and Men living in the lands North of the Wilderland\nand had stolen a great deal of their treasure. He was slain by the\nÉothéod leader Fram, son of Frumgar (an ancestor of Eorl the Young) in\nthe early days of the Éothéod (roughly TA 2000). After Scatha's demise,\npeace came to the land save for a dispute over his stolen treasure. In\nhis hoard was found a silver horn, the Horn of Rohan later given to\nMeriadoc Brandybuck by Éowyn. The Dwarves also claimed the horn\n(partially justified as the Horn of Rohan was said to be Dwarven make)\nbut Fram would not give them anything. Instead, Fram sent them a\nnecklace made out of Scatha's teeth. The Dwarves were insulted and may\nhave slain him and took what they wanted. Etymology His name was likely\ntaken from Anglo-Saxon _sceaða_, “injurious person, criminal, thief,\nassassin”. Speculations - It is likely that Scatha was not the one\nresponsible for death of Dain I as Scatha was killed in TA 2000, long\nbefore the Dain's incident happened in TA 2589. Thus, Scatha could or\ncould not be a fire-breathing one.   - It's possible, as a flightless\ndragon, that Scatha participated in the attack on Gondolin and looted\nthe city after its fall. Thus the Elvish swords, Glamdring, Orcrist, and\nSting, may have been part of the hoard that Fram now possessed. Gallery",

    "text": "The FIRST BATTLE OF THE FORDS OF ISEN was the first battle between\nSaruman's armies and the Rohirrim. There were two battles at the Fords\nof Isen. The first battle took place on February 25, 3019. The second\nwas on March 2, 3019. History Théodred, son of King Théoden of Rohan,\nwas alerted by his scouts to the mustering taking place in Isengard. He\nmanned both sides of the ford and went forward leaving three companies\nof riders to guard the eastern side. Early in the morning, he crossed\nover to the western side with a force mainly consisting of archers and\ncavalry. He planned to take the forces of Uruk-hai by surprise. However,\nSaruman had tricked the scouts; his army was already marching out to\nattack the ford. Twenty miles to the north of the ford, Théodred\nencountered the vanguard of the Uruk-hai and quickly cut through their\nlines. He then charged at the main force, which were prepared for the\nattack and were stationed behind trenches planted with pikes.\nReinforcements came out of Isengard and outflanked the cavalry, nearly\nsurrounding them. Hastily Théodred ordered a retreat, but the Uruk-hai\ncould not be shaken off that easily. Grimbold, who was in command of the\nRohirrim rearguard, had to cut down their pursuers many times. Saruman's\neastern force was much smaller but more dangerous. It contained\nDunlendings, Warg riders and Uruk-hai. The Rohirrim guard on the eastern\nside of the ford had been driven into retreat, and their attackers\nrecrossed the ford to attack Théodred on both sides. Théodred and his\nmen had dismounted on a small islet to cover Grimbold's retreat. At the\nsame time Grimbold's force was being attacked from the western side, and\nas Grimbold looked east, he saw Théodred's force being driven from the\nislet to a hill. Grimbold and a few men raced toward Théodred's\nposition. Théodred was cutting his way through the Uruk-hai lines. But\nby the time Grimbold reached him, Théodred had fallen, cut down by a\ngiant Orc. Grimbold slew the Orc and then found himself defending\nThéodred's body from enemies. He himself would have been cut down had it\nnot been for Elfhelm. Elfhelm had been leading four companies towards\nHelm's Deep, when it was reported to him that two Warg riders had been\nspotted. He rode at full speed to the ford and, seeing the situation,\nordered his men to charge. Before long his men held the western side of\nthe ford. They then charged on the islet. From this surprise attack most\nof the Uruk-hai retreated toward Isengard. When they reached the islet\nthey found Grimbold defending Théodred's body against two huge Orcs.\nElfhelm rushed to his aid and felled one enemy while Grimbold slew the\nother. When they lifted Théodred's body, they found he was still alive.\nHe lived long enough to say, “Let me lie here -to keep the ford until\nÉomer comes.” The enemy attack ended by nightfall. The Rohirrim had held\nthe ford but suffered heavy losses.",

Bilbo Baggins started the book and recounted\nhis quest for Erebor, which he called _There and Back Again_. He later\ngave the book to Frodo at Rivendell after completing it, and Frodo\norganized Bilbo's manuscript and used it to write down his own quest\nduring the War of the Ring.

After Bilbo and Frodo left for\nValinor, the Red Book passed into the keeping of Samwise Gamgee, mayor\nof Hobbiton. The book was left in the possession of Sam Gamgee's eldest\ndaughter, _Elanor Fairbairns_, and her descendants (the _Fairbairns of\nthe Towers_ or _Wardens of Westmarch_). Several copies, with various\nnotes and later additions, were made and the original was kept in a red\ncase (with a three-volume Elvish Translation and a fifth volume ).\nCopies were passed on to future generations, of which one, the “_Thain's\nBook_”, is the most important. From the cover it is properly red\ncolored; and has signature print on the top, shaped as a shine of light.\nIt also has stitch patterns and beautiful marks around the edges. Bilbo\nBaggins' initials BB are in gold and it is very smooth, soft and silky\nto the touch. On the inside, there is a page of contents; writing each\nstory by the four owners.

Location Beginning at Fornost Erain in northern Eriador, it met\nwith the Great East Road at Bree, and then continues south to Tharbad on\nthe Gwathló, where it crossed the river and becomes known as the OLD\nSOUTH ROAD. From there it leads into Dunland, arching slightly towards\nthe Fords of Isen. After it crosses the Isen it is called the GREAT WEST\nROAD, and runs along the Ered Nimrais through Anórien, then goes south\npast Minas Tirith and Osgiliath as the SOUTH ROAD and ends at Pelargir.\nOther roads which meet up with it are the King's Highway from Minas\nTirith past Osgiliath to Minas Ithil, and at Pelargir the road which\neventually ends at Erech as well as the HARAD ROAD which leads into\nSouth Harad. History The Greenway was long the main path of traffic\nbetween Gondor and Arnor, but in the later Third Age after the division\nof Arnor in three realms it became less used. The use of the road\nvirtually ended after the Great Plague and Long Winter when Tharbad was\nabandoned and its bridge ruined, and the road in Dunland was mostly\nlost. Boromir took this road, crossing Tharbad but losing his horse, on\nhis way to Rivendell. In the Reunited Kingdom of King Elessar the road\nwas restored and became usable once more."

History During the\nSecond Age There was also a Council of the Wise held in the mid-Second\nAge to discuss the growing power of Sauron in Mordor; this was also\nknown as the First White Council and was led by Gil-galad. Several\nmembers of this council would also become prominent members of the\nCouncil in the Third Age. During the Third Age The White Council's head\nwas the Wizard Saruman the White, (although Lady Galadriel wished for\nGandalf the Grey to be made the leader of the group). Other members of\nthe Council included the Bearers of the Three Rings of the Elves\n(Gandalf, Galadriel, and Elrond Half-elven), Círdan the Shipwright (who\nhad borne Narya, the Ring of Fire, before handing it on to Gandalf),\nLord Glorfindel, and Radagast the Brown. It is assumed that others of\nthe wise were also members of the White Council. The White Council was\nformed in TA 2463 shortly after the end of the Watchful Peace. In TA\n2851 the White Council met to decide on whether to act on Gandalf's\ndiscovery that the Necromancer was actually Sauron and was at Dol\nGuldur, but Saruman dissuaded the others from taking action, claiming\nthat the Dark Lord was defeated and could not regain his full strength.\nDuring this meeting Gandalf suspected Saruman of desiring to have the\nOne Ring, and there was much tension between the two. However, in TA\n2939, Saruman discovered that Sauron's servants were searching the\nAnduin near Gladden Fields, and that Sauron therefore had learned where\nIsildur had died and where the One Ring might be. Saruman did not inform\nthe Council of this, but when they met again in TA 2941 Saruman finally\nagreed to an attack on Dol Guldur because he wanted to prevent Sauron\nfrom finding the Ring. Sauron was driven out of Dol Guldur, only to\nre-appear in Mordor in 2951, where he declared himself openly and began\ngathering power. The Council last met in TA 2953; at this meeting\nSaruman falsely claimed that the One Ring has been swept out into the\nsea. Afterward Saruman withdrew to Isengard, and fortified it."

    "title": "Ainur",
    "page_id": "2352",
    "text": "The AINUR, also known as the HOLY ONES, are beings encompassing both the\nValar and the Maiar. They were the first and mightiest beings created by\nEru Ilúvatar in the depths of time before the beginning of the World.\nThey were primordial spirits who existed with Ilúvatar, and with him\ncreated the world through the '''Ainulindalë, '''the MUSIC OF THE AINUR.\nAfter the creation of Arda, many of the Ainur descended into it to guide\nand order its growth; of these there were fifteen more powerful than the\nrest. Fourteen of these great Ainur became known as the Valar, or Powers\nof Arda. The fifteenth, Melkor, turned aside from that path and became\nthe first Dark Lord. The many lesser Ainur that accompanied the Valar\ninto Arda are known as Maiar. History Origin The Ainur were the\n'offspring of Ilúvatar's thought' and each was given understanding only\nof that part of the mind of Ilúvatar from which he or she came. The\nexception to this was Melkor, a brother in spirit to Manwë, who later\nbecame The Lord of the Valar and he was given some of the parts from\nwhich the others had come, but for all his gifts he did not know the\nfull mind of Eru. Melkor and Manwë were the most powerful of the Ainur.\nThe Ainur were 'kindled with the Flame Imperishable', which can be taken\nto mean that they were granted free will by their Creator. Ilúvatar\ninstructed them in the arts of music, until he brought them together to\nmake the Music of the Ainur: the great song that created the Vision of\nIlúvatar and ultimately the real world. In the beginning of the Music,\nthe Ainur were all in harmony with Eru and one another, but Melkor\nturned instead to his own pride, seeking power for himself and bringing\ndiscord to the Great Music. He later led many of the Maiar astray as\nwell. The Ainur and the World Through the Music of the Ainur, Ilúvatar\ncreated a Vision of the World; he showed it to the Ainur, and explained\nmuch of its nature and destiny to them - the Ainur therefore have much\nknowledge of the World, but are not themselves omniscient. Ilúvatar then\ngranted the World true being by declaring “Eä”, causing these visions to\ncome into being. Melkor and many of the other mighty Ainur desired to\ndescend into it and form it in readiness for the coming of the Children\nof Ilúvatar (that is, Elves and Men).  Upon descending into the World,\nthe Ainur became known as the Valar and the Maiar. Those Ainur who\nentered the World and chose to live in it at its beginning remain bound\nto it until its end. Though Melkor was eventually thrown into the Void\nby the others, he is prophesied to return before the end in the DAGOR\nDAGORATH, the final battle. Little is known of the ultimate future of\nthe Ainur, even by themselves, but it is said that after the great\nbattle at the end of the World, they will make a Second, even greater\nMusic with the Children of Ilúvatar. The Line of Melian Among the many\nAinur who entered the World long ago, there was one of the order of the\nMaiar named Melian. Alone of all the Ainur, she wedded one of the\nChildren of Ilúvatar, King Elu Thingol of Doriath, and wove the Girdle\nof Melian that protected Doriath for many centuries. Through her, an\nessence of the Ainur entered the bloodlines of the Elves and Men, passed\ndown through generation after generation, and was still present at the\ntime of the War of the Ring. Elrond was Melian's great-great-grandson,\nand Aragorn, too, was her descendant, though through many more\ngenerations than Elrond. Etymology AINUR is a Quenyan word originating\nfrom Valarin and means “Holy ones”. It appears to come from the word\nAINA, meaning 'holy'. Although the origin of the second element '''ur\n'''is less clear, it is possible there is a link between the word\n'Ainur' and the word 'Eru' as the first element 'er' means 'one', though\nthis may not be true as there is no further elaboration on this. The\nsingular form of Ainur is AINU, simply meaning “Holy one”.",

    "text": "The DAGOR BRAGOLLACH or BATTLE OF THE SUDDEN FLAME was the fourth of the\ngreat battles of the War of the Jewels. It marked the end of the Siege\nof Angband and beginning of Morgoth's gains against the Elves and Men of\nthe Beleriand. History For four hundred years after Dagor Aglareb the\nÑoldor had managed to contain Morgoth's power inside Angband. Peace and\nprosperity reigned in Beleriand, to the point where green grass grew\neven to the very doors of Angband. The strength of the Elven kingdoms,\nand that of their Edain allies, became such that Fingolfin, High King of\nthe Ñoldor, believed that the siege would last forever. But though the\nElves and Edain had managed to contain Morgoth's forces, it was beyond\ntheir power to assault Angband or to overthrow the power of Morgoth. As\nsuch, the Dark Lord labored undisturbed in Angband during the siege,\nbreeding countless legions of Orcs and other evil creatures, as well\ncreating the first Dragon. He intended to use this new, unprecedentedly\npowerful force to utterly destroy those who had opposed him. However, in\nthe furious haste of his malice, he decided to strike before his designs\nwere complete, cynically underestimating the valor of the Elves, and not\naccounting for the Edain at all. This haste was credited as the reason\nwhy resistance against Morgoth was able to continue after the conclusion\nof the conflict; for if Morgoth had waited for a short time longer to\ncomplete the buildup of his forces, his foes would have been\nannihilated. On a cold winter's night when the Elven watch was at its\nleast vigilant, Morgoth sent out rivers of flame and poisonous fumes\nfrom Thangorodrim and the Iron Mountains. The plains of Ard-galen were\nconsumed by the fire and transformed into a barren desert which was\nrenamed Anfauglith, “the Gasping Dust”. The Elves had never faced an\nassault of this sort before, and many perished as they fled from these\nflames. Behind them came the Balrogs, Glaurung the Father of Dragons,\nand legions of Orcs in such numbers as the Elves had never imagined.\nMorgoth's primary aim was an onslaught so rapid that the various\nkingdoms of the Elves would not be able to consolidate their forces or\ncome to each others aid. And so it was that each of the Elven kingdoms\nhad to fight Morgoth's forces on their own. The Orcs quickly overran the\nhighlands of Dorthonion, and slew Angrod and Aegnor. Maglor's horsemen\nwere burnt alive on the plain of Lothlann, and Maglor's Gap was taken,\ngiving Morgoth an entry into Beleriand. Maglor retreated with heavy\nlosses to Himring, where he helped defend the city of Maedhros. Though\ngrievously besieged, the heavily fortified city did not fall, and\nMaedhros himself accomplished deeds of surpassing valor during the\nfighting. The Pass of Aglon was also breached, and Celegorm and Curufin\nfled north of Doriath to Nargothrond. Morgoth's Orcs took the mountain\nforests of Mount Rerir, and defiled Lake Helevorn, scattering south\nthrough Thargelion into East Beleriand. Caranthir fled to Amon Ereb,\nwhere he and Amrod built defenses. From there they slowly freed East\nBeleriand of the Orcs, while Maglor and Maedhros held the northern\nborder. Eventually, Maedhros even managed to re-secure the Pass of\nAglon, denying the forces of Morgoth continued entry into Beleriand from\nthat route. Minas Tirith in the Pass of Sirion in the West under\nOrodreth held, and Orodreth's uncle and Lord Finrod Felagund came north\nfrom Nargothrond with a large army. However, they were ambushed by a\nhuge number of Morgoth's forces at the Fen of Serech. The Noldor found\nthemselves trapped, and Finrod would have been killed or taken but for a\nsortie by Barahir and his men, who descended from Dorthonion and rescued\nthe Elven lord. The cost in lives was heavy, but Finrod escaped the\nOrcs. In profound gratitude, Finrod gave Barahir his ring, which would\nbecome known as the Ring of Barahir, and pledged that he would aid\nBarahir and his kin in any time of need. Finrod and his folk fled south\nto Nargothrond, while Barahir continued defending Dorthonion until both\nhis forces and his people dwindled to nothing. The mountain forts of the\nEred Wethrin around Hithlum were heavily assaulted but managed barely to\nhold, as the mountains themselves provided protection from the fires\nMorgoth had released from Thangorodrim. Thus the Siege was broken, the\nSons of Fëanor scattered, and the forces of Morgoth roamed at will\nthroughout the north. When Fingolfin, the High King of the Ñoldor,\nlearned of the heavy casualties of so many Ñoldor, he rode in wrath\nacross the dust of Anfauglith to Angband and challenged Morgoth to\nsingle combat. At the doors of Angband itself, they fought a great duel,\nand Fingolfin wounded Morgoth seven times. Yet, Fingolfin was ultimately\nno match for the Dark Lord and was crushed beneath Morgoth's foot, but\nnot before stabbing Morgoth in the heel with his last stroke. Thorondor,\nking of the Great Eagles, then swooped down and retrieved Fingolfin's\nbody and scarred Morgoth's face. Though Morgoth's wounds would never\nheal and he was left with a permanent limp, Morgoth and his forces were\nnevertheless victorious. Still, Morgoth was cautious. For though he had\nwon a great victory, his foes had inflicted upon him loss as great as\ntheir own. As his initial onslaught had abated, his foes had begun to\nrecover, making small advances into the fringes of the territory he had\nconquered. He had not expected the Elves to resist him so strongly, and\nthe aid of their Edain allies had been a completely unforeseen variable\nin his plans. As such, he checked his assault and recalled the main host\nof the Orcs to Angband. Two years after Morgoth's onslaught abated, the\nisle of Tol Sirion, held by Orodreth brother of Finrod, came under\nassault by Morgoth's most terrible servant, Sauron. His coming caused a\ndark cloud of fear to grip the hearts and wills of the defenders, and\nthe watchtower of Minas Tirith upon the isle was taken. This secured for\nMorgoth the western pass of the river Sirion. After another five years\nhad passed, Morgoth renewed his assault against Hithlum and very nearly\ndestroyed it. Fortunately for Fingon, now High King of the Ñoldor, his\nforces were reinforced by a host under the command of Círdan, and the\nOrcs were repelled. Etymology _DAGOR BRAGOLLACH_ is Sindarin for 'Battle\nof Sudden Flame'.",

    "page_id": "2355",
    "text": "DORIATH (Sindarin IPA: ) (aka ARTANOR\") was an Elven realm, the land of\nthe Sindar that existed during the latter-half of the Years of the Trees\nand most of the First Age of the Sun. For thousands of years it was\nseparate from the outside world under the rule of King Thingol and the\nprotection of his wife Melian the Maia, until it was drawn into the war\nagainst Morgoth and the doom that lay on the Ñoldor, because of the Oath\nof Fëanor. Description Doriath was located in the middle of Beleriand,\nbetween Ered Gorgoroth (Mountains of Terror) from the north and the\nAndram from south, and Talath Dirnen from the west, and Estolad from the\neast. It was a realm of forests about the great river Sirion; within it\nwere the forests _Neldoreth_ (also _Taur-na-Neldor_, the northern beech\nforest), _Nivrim_ (also West-march, an oak forest), and _Region_\n(pronounced Reh-gi-on, the main forest). Additionally, the forests of\n_Brethil_ and ''Nan Elmoth ''were considered to be under the influence\nof Thingol, though not under his direct command and laying outside of\nthe Girdle of Melian. Eöl the Dark Elf leased Nan Elmoth from Thingol,\nhaving paid with the sword Anglachel. The People of Haleth, or the\nHaladin, lived in Brethil with the permission of Thingol. They governed\nthemselves, but cooperated with the march-wardens of Doriath. King Elu\nThingol of Doriath, also High King of the Sindar, saw all of Beleriand\nas his realm, from the Gelion to the Belegaer (the Sea). History Years\nof the Trees The Vanyar and Ñoldor had passed by it on the Great\nJourney, and had been ferried across on Tol Eressëa by the time the\nTeleri arrived. Then their lord Elwë was lost in Nan Elmoth, and when\nUlmo returned for them, a part remained behind. They became known as the\nSindar or Grey Elves, and when Thingol returned he became their king,\nruling from Doriath. The forests of Neldoreth and Region were located in\nthe center of Beleriand, and were the abode of King Thingol and Melian.\nTheir people were the people of the Teleri who did not heed the call of\nthe Valar to pass over the sea to Valinor. All the Elves of Beleriand,\nfrom the shipbuilders under Círdan in the Falas, to the hunters of the\nBlue Mountains, held Thingol as their lord. During the First and Second\nAges of the Chaining of Melkor, Beleriand was peaceful. However, by the\nend of the First Age, Melian forebode that evil was to come, and Thingol\ncalled on the aid of the Dwarves of Belegost to aid in constructing a\ncity-fortress for the protection of his people. They also helped make\nfor them a store of stronger and better weapons that were better able to\ndeal with the Orcs of north. This was built under ground along the\nsouthern side of the River Esgalduin, and was called Menegroth, which\nbecame Thingol's capital. For the most part, the Elves lived in\nscattered bands throughout Beleriand, only gathering in larger numbers\nin Neldoreth and Region (together called Eglador), and along the Falas.\nDuring the Third Age of the Chaining of Melkor, Thingol proceeded to arm\nhis people with the aid of the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost against\nthe continued foreboding of Melian. After Melkor's release, his attack\non the Two Trees with Ungoliant, and flight to Middle-earth, the\nsituation for Beleriand suddenly worsened. Ungoliant fled south from the\nBalrogs after her confrontation with Melkor, now Morgoth, and was only\nchecked by the power of Melian. Some time after, the forces of Morgoth\nleft the freshly delved Angband and assaulted Beleriand from east and\nwest in the First Battle of Beleriand. In the east, King Thingol lead\nthe forces of Beleriand, with the aid of Denethor and his Nandor and\nelves from Ossiriand, and completely defeated the Orcs of the eastern\narmy. Denethor was killed on Amon Ereb, and some of his people merged\nthemselves to the Sindarin Elves under King Thingol. Upon returning to\nMenegroth, Thingol learned that the western army of Morgoth had overrun\nthe Falas. Thingol recalls all of his people he can into Neldoreth and\nRegion, and Melian puts forth her power and rings the region in a girdle\nof enchantment called the Girdle of Melian. At that point, the region\nformally called Eglador comes to be formally known as Doriath, the\nGuarded Kingdom. The First Battle is the only time King Thingol leads\nhis forces into battle outside of his realm for the entirety of the\nFirst Age of the Sun. Afterwards, the Elves of Doriath fight\ndefensively, guarding their borders and the important river crossings\nnearby. First Age When the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth at the\nbeginning of the First Age, Thingol refused to allow them in Doriath,\nwith the exception of the children of Finarfin, who were related to him\nby his brother Olwë. When later Men arrived in Beleriand, they were also\nrefused entry, but at Finrod's request the Haladin gives his permission\nfor the People of Haleth to dwell in Brethil, who ally themselves with\nDoriath and aid them in its defense. Throughout the rest of the First\nAge, while the Noldor fight their wars with Morgoth, Doriath stands\ninviolate and generally aloof, refusing to take part in the wars.\nUltimately, however, King Thingol is pulled into the doom surround the\nNoldor as was told in the Lay of Leithian, when Beren, son of Barahir\nand lord of the First House of Men, passed through the Girdle as Melian\nhad foretold, and arrived in Neldoreth. Realizing that his beloved\ndaughter Lúthien had fallen in love with him, King Thingol decreed that\nhe would not allow them to marry unless Beren would undertake a quest to\nrecover a Silmaril from the Dark Lord Morgoth, and so begins the Quest\nfor the Silmarils. After the Quest for the Silmaril, the Wolf Carcharoth\nalso breached the Girdle, but Thingol, Beren, and Thingol's captains\nBeleg and Mablung hunted and killed the beast. At the end of this,\nThingol ended up in possession of one of the Silmarils. Beren and\nLúthien, wedded together by fate and returning from the dead, left\nDoriath to live in Ossiriand. After the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, only three\nelven kingdoms remained: Nargothrond, Gondolin, and Doriath. Nargothrond\nfell soon after, as told in the _Narn i Chîn Húrin_ (Tale of the\nChildren of Hurin). Fearing that the cruel Easterlings would enthrall\nher only son Túrin of Hithlum, Morwen sent him to Doriath where he would\nbe safe until he came of age, when he fled from the land. Later his\nmother and sister, Morwen and Nienor lived there, until they were lost.\nHurin, captured at the Nirnaeth and released from Angband after the\ndeath of his son Turin, recovers the Nauglamir from the ruin of\nNargothrond. Traveling to Doriath, he throws it at the feet of Thingol\nin spite. Melian rebukes him, and Hurin, cured of the madness of Morgoth\nby Melian, lifts up the Nauglamir and presents it to Thingol before\nleaving Doriath, and vanishing from history. Fall of Doriath Húrin\nbrought the treasure of Nargothrond to Doriath after the fall of\nFinrod's realm, and Thingol enlisted the Dwarves of Nogrod to combine\nthe Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien with the Nauglamir, the Dwarves'\nNecklace. The Dwarves then attacked Thingol and slew him, stealing the\nnecklace, during the first Sack of Doriath. Melian then left, and with\nher, the protective Girdle thus ended the bliss of old that reigned in\nDoriath for thousands of years, and things would never be the same\nagain. Thingol, in possession of the greatest work of the Elves (a\nSilmaril of Fëanor) and Dwarves (the Nauglamir) decides to merge the\ntwo. He convinces a large company of smiths from Nogrod to attempt to\nremake the Nauglamir to incorporate the Silmaril, which they succeed in\ndoing. Once the work is complete, and the joint works of Elves and\nDwarves sits glittering before Thingol, he moves to take it and put it\non. The Dwarves stop him, demanding it in payment. Thingol rebukes them\nwith haughty words, at which the Dwarves slay him. The Dwarves attempt\nto escape Doriath, but most are killed and the Nauglamir recovered.\nAfter Thingol's death, Melian departs Doriath in grief and withdraws her\npower from Doriath. After telling Mablung to send word to Beren, she\nvanishes from Middle-earth and returns to Valinor. Doriath now lies\nundefended. Two Dwarves return from Doriath and tell a twisted version\nof the events to their king in Nogrod. The Dwarves of Nogrod raise an\narmy and assault Doriath in retaliation. The slaughter is great on both\nsides, but the Dwarves end up victorious. Menegroth is ransacked, many\nof its people are killed, and the Dwarves begin the long trek for home\nladen with the spoils of war, including the Nauglamir. At Sarn Athrad,\nthey are assaulted by a force of Green Elves led by Beren who, with the\naid of the Ents of Ossiriand, annihilate the Dwarven force and recover\nthe Silmaril. Dior Eluchîl, son of Beren and Lúthien and heir to\nThingol, returns to Doriath with his wife Nimloth, their two sons Eluréd\nand Elurín, and their daughter Elwing. He begins to rebuild the fortunes\nof the kingdom and it is briefly restored. Beren takes the Nauglamir to\nLúthien, who wears it, enriching their home on Tol Galen. However, Beren\nand Lúthien soon die for the second time, leaving the world forever. The\nNauglamir and its Silmaril are brought to Dior. Soon after, the Sons of\nFëanor, following the Oath, demand the return of the Silmaril. Dior\nrefuses, and the Sons of Fëanor invade Doriath, at which point the\nSecond Kinslaying occurs. Celegorm, Curufin, and Caranthir are killed,\nas is Dior, Nimloth, and Eluréd and Elurín. The people of Doriath are\nkilled or scattered, with Elwing taking the Nauglamir and fleeing with a\nremnant of the people of Doriath to the Mouths of Sirion. Doriath was\nnever rebuilt and afterwards Doriath remained abandoned and unpopulated\nuntil it was sunk along with most of the rest of Beleriand. Etymology In\nSindarin, _Doriath_ means “Land of the Fence”, from _dôr_ (“land”) and\n_iâth_ (“fence”). Its previous name _EGLADOR_ either means “Land of the\nForsaken” or “Land of the Elves”, because the inhabitants called\nthemselves “Eglath”. The High Elves called Doriath the “Land of the\nCave”, from the Ñoldorin _gath_ or _gatta_ (“cavern”) _GARTHÚRIAN_ was\nname ascribed to the land of Doriath in earlier versions of the accounts\nof the First Age (specifically in _The War of the Jewels_)_._",

    "text": "The '''Vanyar '''(Quenya; IPA: ; singular VANYA; adjectival VANYARIN; ),\nalso called the FAIR ELVES, '''Light-elves ''', and 'SPEAR-ELVES' , were\nthe first and smallest of the Kindreds of the Eldar. Under the\nleadership of Ingwë, the Vanyar were the first to set forth on the Great\nJourney and the first to reach the shores of Belegaer; they sailed to\nAman on the first voyage of Tol Eressëa and remained there permanently.\nThe Vanyar are the fairest of all the elves hence their name: the FAIR\nELVES. Unlike the others who were attracted to the sea or the building\nand forging of things, the Vanyar culture seemed to revolve about Valar\nand Valinor. This is probably the reason why they choose to stay in\nValinor proper centered around Taniquetil, the seat of the rulers of\nArda, and loved the light of Valinor best of all the other places in\nAman and the wisdom of the Valar, and why they were favored by Manwë and\nVarda and always distrusted Melkor. They are known to have had the\ngreatest skill in poetry of all the Elves, likened to Manwë who loves\nthem for it. Their hair colour was golden and their banners white. Ingwë\nwas their king. History Vanyar are descendants of Imin, the first Elf to\nawake at Cuiviénen, his wife Iminyë, and six other pairs of Elves who\nwere awoken by them. Imin's companions, Tata and Enel, later awoke\ngroups of nine and twelve pairs respectively, and Imin decided that\nsince his group was now the smallest and each group that he and his\ncompanions discovered was larger than the last, he would now choose\nthird rather than first in order to make up the numbers. However, only a\nfurther two groups were discovered, leaving Imin's group of fourteen by\nfar the smallest of the three Elven clans. When the Elves were\ndiscovered by Oromë, each clan chose an ambassador to return with him to\nValinor to verify his claims of its greatness. The Minyar (Imin's\ncompanions) sent Ingwë. Upon his return, his people were swayed by his\ntestimony and adopted him as their king (appropriate, as the name Ingwë\nmeans chieftain in Quenya), and he led them with Oromë to Aman. Ingwë\nhas since been reckoned the High King of all Elves, and became known as\nIngwë Ingweron, the “Chief of Chieftains”, and his people were known by\nthe rest of the Eldar as the Vanyar. In Aman the Vanyar first dwelt in\nTirion. Later, they came to love the full light of the Trees and\nwandered into Valinor or settled on Taniquetil. He dwells with them on\nthe slopes of Taniquetil, beneath the halls of Manwë. After arriving in\nAman, the Vanyar were rarely seen even by other Elves. Very few\nindividual Vanyar are named besides Imin, Ingwë, his sister (or possibly\nniece) Indis, and Amarië, who was in love with Finrod Felagund. ☀,\nIndis, the second wife of Finwë, the High King of the Ñoldor and the\nmother of both Fingolfin and Finarfin, the latter of which founded the\nonly house of Noldorin Elves to sport golden Vanyarin hair. After her\nhusband was killed by Melkor in his attack on Formenos to attain the\nSilmarils , she returned to her people with her daughter Findis. Unlike\nthe Noldor, the Vanyar loved the light of Valinor so much that they\nnever choose to return to Middle-earth save when many of the Vanyar\nmarched in the War of Wrath with the Host of Valinor. Though they\npreferred the peaceful light of Valinor, the Vanyar were skilled in the\narts of war and were known for their fashioning of spears, thus they no\ndoubt fielded a formidable army in the war. Ingwë's son led an armed\nhost of his people from Valinor to fight in the War of Wrath. They\nreturned to Aman, along with most of the Eldar living in the now largely\ndestroyed Beleriand, at the end of the First Age. Relations Galadriel\nwas the granddaughter of Indis. It is to her Vanyarin blood that\nGaladriel owes her famous silver-gold hair. Etymology The name _Vanyar_\nmeans 'Fair-ones' in Quenya , referring to their golden hair. The Vanyar\noften called themselves MINYAR; IPA: ; “Firsts”; singular MINYA;\nadjectival MINYARIN; ), their ancient name. This ancient name does not\nstill refer to any of the Avari who remained in Middle-earth, since all\nof the Vanyar heeded the call of the Valar to come to Valinor. Other\nVersions of the Legendarium In the earliest versions of Tolkien's\nmythology (see: _The History of Middle-earth_), they were called INGWI,\nas they were the people of Ingwë, the High King of the Elves.

    "text": "HUAN was a great wolfhound of the First Age. He was given by the Vala\nOromë the Hunter to his friend Celegorm, one of the Sons of Fëanor. Huan\nwas as large as a small horse, and accompanied Celegorm on his huntings.\nWhen the Ñoldor under Fëanor rebelled, Huan went with his master to\nMiddle-earth. Huan had been granted special powers by the Valar, and was\nallowed to speak three times before he died. It was also prophesied that\nhe could not be killed unless it was by the greatest wolf that ever\nlived. Biography Huan was originally a Hound of Oromë in Valinor and was\neventually given to Celegorm, Fëanor's third son. He went into exile\nwith his master during the Flight of the Ñoldor. He might have stayed\nwith his master in Himlad and later fled with him to Nargothrond after\ntheir defeat in the Dagor Bragollach. He became involved with the Quest\nfor the Silmaril. When Beren had left Lúthien and gone with Finrod\nFelagund to Angband but had been captured in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, Lúthien\nset out to rescue him. She was intercepted by Celegorm and Curufin, who\nwere living in Nargothrond at the time and were hunting. Huan smelt\nLúthien and captured her, and she was brought before Celegorm. Celegorm\nand Curufin did not reveal to her that they had sent Beren to his death\nby the hand of Sauron, and took her as a prisoner to Nargothrond, “for\nher own protection”, secretly plotting to wed her to Celegorm and\nthereby force an alliance with Lúthien's father Thingol. Huan felt pity\nfor Lúthien, and sought her out. Speaking for the first time, he told\nher of a way to escape, using a secret exit, and then accompanied her to\nTol-in-Gaurhoth where, with the help of Lúthien's magic, he killed all\nof Sauron's werewolves until Sauron himself came out, knowing of the\nprophesy about Huan's death he took the shape of the greatest wolf that\nhad ever lived up to that point. Huan nevertheless managed to defeat\nhim, and Sauron was forced to flee. Huan went back to his master, while\nLúthien and Beren went on their way back to Doriath, they came across\nCelegorm and Curufin once more, who had been exiled from Nargothrond by\nOrodreth when he learned of their deeds. Curufin tried to kill Lúthien,\nbut Huan turned against his master, defending Beren and Lúthien.\nSpeaking for the second time, Huan told Beren and Lúthien of his plan to\ngain entrance to Angband, bringing them the skin of the werewolf\nDraugluin and the bat-skin of Sauron's messenger Thuringwethil. Using\nthese skins as disguise Beren and Lúthien went to Angband, while Huan\nhunted in the wild. After Beren and Lúthien had won the Silmaril but\nBeren had lost his hand to the werewolf Carcharoth, Huan joined Beren,\nThingol, Beleg Cúthalion and Mablung in the Hunt for the Wolf. Huan and\nBeren managed to kill Carcharoth, but Huan was mortally wounded.\nSpeaking for the third and last time, he wished Beren and Lúthien\nfarewell, and died. Etymology _HUAN_ literally means “great dog, hound”,\nderiving from the Sindarin _hû_ (“hound”). In Quenya, Huan also means\n“hound”, which comes from the word _khugan_ or _hunen_. Other versions\nin the legendarium In earlier texts, Huan was described to be the\n“Captain of Dogs” and a rival to Tevildo (later Sauron), the Prince of\nCats. Here, Huan met Tinuviel (Lúthien), who was initially afraid and\nfled from him. With his speed Huan overtook her in two leaps and spoke\n“soft and deep the tongue of the Lost Elves”. There was also a mention\nof Huan being a possible Maia, along with Sorontar (Thorondor). Some of\nthis storyline is re-adapted back into Beren and Lúthien (2017) for the\n'complete tale'.",

    "page_id": "2354",
    "text": "MELIAN (Sindarin IPA: ) was a Maia of the race of the Ainur, Queen of\nDoriath and mother of Lúthien Tinúviel. Biography Before she came to\nMiddle-earth, Melian served both Vána and Estë, and dwelt in Lórien\ntending the trees that grew in the Gardens of Irmo. Among all of her\npeople none were wiser, (With the possible exception of Gandalf) more\nbeautiful, or more skilled in singing enchanting songs than Melian. She\nloved the deep shadows of the great trees. When the light of the Two\nTrees would mingle Melian would sing and the Valar would stop their work\nand listen. Nightingales went with her wherever she went, and she taught\nthem their song. Of all the Valar she was most akin to Yavanna. When the\nElves awoke on the shore of Cuiviénen she departed from Valinor and went\nto Middle-earth, where she filled its silence with her singing and the\nsinging of her birds. While in the forest of Nan Elmoth she met and fell\nin love with the Elven-king Elu Thingol, and later she ruled the kingdom\nof Doriath by his side. For thousands of years, she used her powers to\nguard and defend the city with a protection spell called the _Girdle of\nMelian_, but she predicted that one person would one day breach this\ndefense. The Girdle functioned to bewilder any who attempted to enter\nDoriath, and was so potent that even Ungoliant was unable to bypass it.\nShe and her husband had a child, a daughter named Lúthien. During her\nstay in Doriath she became a friend and mentor of Galadriel. Melian\nwanted to know the cause of the exile of the Ñoldor. Galadriel only\nbriefly narrated the story to her, leaving out the death of Finwë, the\nKinslaying at Alqualondë, and the burning of the ships at Losgar. But\neventually she and Thingol learned the truth. Melian's main line of\ndescent is of the Half-elven, and through her daughter the Maian blood\npassed to both Elves and Men. When Beren arrived as foretold, she\ncounseled Thingol against sending Beren for a Silmaril, a quest which\nwould eventually lead to Doriath's ruin. A friend of Mankind, she also\naided Húrin's family by hosting Túrin in Doriath and later helped Beleg\nCúthalion in his search for Túrin by giving him Lembas. When Húrin came\nto Doriath old and carrying a great grief and misery on him, Melian\nhelped him see through his ills. After Thingol's death she left Doriath,\nvisiting Beren and Lúthien for a time warning them of the Dwarves\ntreachery, and the curse on the Mîm's treasure. Shortly there-after, she\nwent back to Valinor, musing upon her sorrows in the gardens of Lorien\nwhence she came. Etymology _Melian_ is Sindarin, from the Quenya\n_Melyanna_, of which the roots are _mel_ (love) and _anna_ (gift). The\nname means “dear gift.” Earlier versions of Melian's name were\n'''Gwenniel '''and GWENETHLIN. _Beren and Lúthien_ (2017) reintroduces\nthe names GWENDELING and GWENDELIN into the 'complete story'.

    "text": "The CHILDREN OF ILÚVATAR are Elves and Men, the two races created by Eru\nIlúvatar, the supreme being of created universe. History After the\nthemes of Ilúvatar and the proclamation of Eä, Eru set the all the\nfirstborn of Elves and Men in places of the world that even the Valar\ncould not find. Elves were the first of the Children of Ilúvatar to\nappear in Middle-earth, whereas Men were not to follow until the\nbeginning of the First Age, with the creation of the Sun and Moon, many\nthousands of years later. Elves were also named the _Quendi_ (“those who\nspeak”, in Quenya) and the _Minnónar_ (“Firstborn”). They were further\ndivided into many groupings, often distinguished by their respective\nlinguistic branches. Men were also named the _Apanónar_ (“Those born\nafter” or “Afterborn”), _Fírimar_ (“Mortals”), _Engwar_ (“the Sickly”),\nand the _Followers_. These somewhat derogatory names were given to Men\nby the Elves, who were the primary historians of the early events of\nMiddle-earth.The reason for this naming was simple. Dwarves were not\noriginally included in this distinction, as they were creations of Aulë\nalone. The story of their creation was told in the _Quenta\nSilmarillion_, and explains how the Elves and Men were created by Eru\nIlúvatar directly, without delegation to the Ainur. Animals and plants\nwere probably fashioned by Ainur after themes set out by Eru in the\nMusic of the Ainur. In cases where animals exhibit sapience, as in the\ncase of Huan or the Eagles, this is questionable they may actually be\nMaiar instead."

    "text": "QUENTA SILMARILLION is a collection of fictional legends written by J.\nR. R. Tolkien. It was published after his death as part of _The\nSilmarillion_ together with four shorter stories. As Tolkien did not\nfinish it, the collection was completed by his son Christopher with\nassistance of the young Guy Gavriel Kay. The title _Quenta Silmarillion_\nis translated as “the Tale of the Silmarils”. The QUENTA SILMARILLION is\nthe third part of the _The Silmarillion._ _Quenta Silmarillion_ is the\nlargest final-rendition account of the First Age, and its stories\nnarrate all of that Age's major events.

Originated from Elvish legends, in some parts it presents\nElves as long gone, which hints that its final form was edited during\nthe Fourth Age by Hobbits and/or Men. It tells about the history of Arda\n(the Earth), after its creation by Eru Ilúvatar. The Valar, angelic\nbeings, enter into the world and try to shape it after a vision given to\nthem by Eru. The initial shape of Arda, chosen by the Valar, was of a\nsymmetrical continent lit by the Two Lamps. However, the lamps were\ndestroyed by the vicious Melkor; Arda was darkened, and the lamps' fall\nspoiled the symmetry of Arda's surface. Two main continents were created\nthat are of concern to the story: Aman in the west, and Middle-earth in\nthe east. Following this, Melkor hid himself from the Valar in his\nfortress Utumno in the north of Middle-earth. He also surrounded himself\nwith horrible beasts, many of them Maia in the form of fell animals,\nknown as Balrogs. The Valar moved to the western continent Aman where\nthey established the realm Valinor of which Manwë was made king. The\nVala Yavanna created the Two Trees which illuminated Valinor.\nMiddle-earth, by contrast, was in perpetual darkness, and was seldom\nvisited by the Valar. Only some of them, most notably Oromë, visited it\nperiodically, especially to prepare for the coming of the Elves, which\nthe Valar had foreseen in their vision and to keep an eye on Melkor's\nactivities. Introduction of the Elves On one of his expeditions Oromë\ndiscovered the newly-awakened Elves at Cuiviénen. The Valar, aware of\nthe risk Melkor posed to the Elves, beleaguered his fortress and finally\noverthrew him and took him prisoner to Valinor to serve “three ages” in\nthe Halls of Mandos. Oromë was then sent to the Elves again, to invite\nthem to come with him to Aman and live there. Some of the Elves did not\nfollow him or became sidetracked and stayed in Middle-earth, and so the\nElves became sundered. These notably included the Sindar, who stayed in\nMiddle-earth when their king, Thingol, became lost in the forest. He was\nto later emerge, married to the Maia Melian, and found the Kingdom of\nDoriath. The Elves who accepted the summons were carried across the sea\non a floating island. The Noldor and Melkor Finwë, the first High King\nof the Ñoldor, had a son Fëanor. At his birth Fëanor drew so much life\nfrom his mother Míriel that she grew weary of life and her spirit left\nher bodily form, departing to the halls of Mandos. Eventually, Finwë\nmarried Indis and had two further sons, Fingolfin and Finarfin. Fëanor\nbecame the most famous Elven craftsman, especially by making the\nSilmarils, three jewels in which he trapped the light of the Two Trees.\nThe Silmarils were hallowed by Varda, and would burn any evil or mortal\ncreature who touched them. About this time, Melkor, having completed his\nsentence, convinced the other Valar that he had reformed and he was\nreleased. By various lies he managed to play Fëanor and Fingolfin\nagainst each other, creating strife and division amongst the Noldor;\nfurthermore, he convinced the Ñoldor that they had been brought to Aman\nprimarily so the Valar could keep them under control. Finally, Fëanor\nrebelled against the Valar, publicly advocating leaving and then drawing\nhis weapon against Fingolfin. The Valar were soon aware of Melkor's\nultimate responsibility in this. Tulkas hunted him, but Melkor had\nhidden and could not be found. Because he threatened Fingolfin's life,\nFëanor was exiled from Tirion for twelve years. With his seven sons and\nhis father Finwë he moved to a newly-built stronghold, Formenos.\nCoveting the Silmarils, Melkor went to Formenos, hoping to trick Fëanor\nand gain possession of them, but Fëanor saw through his ruse and\ndismissed him with contempt. Melkor then traveled to Avathar in secret,\nwhere he joined forces with the evil spirit Ungoliant, whose form was a\ngiant spider-like creature. Melkor swore an oath to give Ungoliant\nwhatever she desired, and imparted some of his power to her. With her\nhelp, they traveled into Valinor secretly, where Ungoliant's poison\nkilled the Two Trees. Covered by an impenetrable blackness, Melkor and\nUngoliant then traveled to Formenos, assassinated Finwë and stole the\nSilmarils, before escaping in the confusion. Melkor and Ungoliant then\nmade their way across to Middle-earth, and he gave Ungoliant all the\ngreat jewels he had stolen, except the Silmarils, which he desired to\nkeep. The rapacious Ungoliant consumed them all and, still hungry, she\ndemanded the Silmarils, but the ever-treacherous Melkor reneged on his\noath, so she seized him and bound him with her webs, and his anguished\ncries echoed across all of Middle-earth. Melkor escaped from Ungoliant\nwith the help of his former servants, the Balrogs, who came to his aid\nfrom their hiding places in the deepest recesses of the ruins of Utumno,\nand he re-established his empire in the North from his secondary\nfortress of Angband. He placed the three Silmarils, which now were the\nonly source of the unmarred light of the Two Trees, in his Iron Crown,\nalthough his hands were burned black by them. Fëanor was furious at the\ndeath of his father and the theft of the Silmarils. Travelling to Tirion\nin violation of his exile, he publicly blamed both Melkor, whom he named\nMorgoth, and the Valar (for failing to protect Finwë and the Silmarils).\nHe urged the Noldor to leave Valinor, for a punitive expedition against\nMorgoth and a new life in Middle-earth. He and his sons then swore the\nnotorious Oath of Fëanor, vowing to pursue with hatred anyone who\nwithheld a Silmaril from them. Departure of the Noldor and assault on\nDoriath Inflamed by the passionate urging of Fëanor, most of the\nassembled Ñoldor left Tirion, and traveled to Alqualondë, attempting to\npersuade the Teleri to join them, or at least to lend them ships to\ncross the Great Sea. When the Teleri refused, Fëanor ordered that the\nswan-ships be taken by force; the notorious Kinslaying ensued, in which\nmany Teleri were slaughtered. Shortly afterwards, at the northern\nboundary of Eldamar, the Noldor encountered Mandos, who cursed all the\nÑoldor who left with Fëanor . At this point, Finarfin, who had always\nbeen reluctant to leave, turned back to Valinor with a small number of\nfollowers. Many ships had been lost by this time and not all the Ñoldor\ncould cross to Middle-earth, so Fëanor and his sons seized the remaining\nswan-ships, abandoning Fingolfin and his followers (including\nGaladriel), who were obliged to make their way to Middle-earth across\nthe terrible ice wastes of the Helcaraxë. Approximately 2.2 million\nNoldor are said to have perished on the Helcaraxë. Meanwhile, Morgoth\nattempted to conquer Doriath, the realm of Thingol and Melian in\nMiddle-earth. In the first of five great Battles, he sent out two armies\nof Orcs, forcing Thingol and his Maia queen to establish a magical\nboundary around Doriath, the “Girdle of Melian”, while the coastal Elves\nwere forced to retreat into their fortified harbour towns. By luck,\nFëanor and his host arrived at the height of this conflict and the\ncombined forces of the Ñoldor and the Sindar utterly defeated the Orc\narmies in the second Battle, Dagor-nuin-Giliath (Battle under the\nStars). However Fëanor, in his fury, chased after the retreating Orcs\nand he was ambushed and killed by Balrogs. The Sun and the Moon, the\nLong Peace and the Coming of Men The grieving Valar could not revive the\nTwo Trees,because Fëanor would not give up the silmarills which captured\nthe light of the trees. But they were able to create the Moon and the\nSun from a silver leaf and a golden fruit, which were all that remained\nof them. These new lights illuminated Middle-earth, stimulated much new\nplant and animal growth, and for a while, confounded the plans of\nMorgoth. Unable to assail them, as his once near-limitless power grew\never more dispersed among his servants, who feared the new lights no\nless than he, the Dark Lord was forced to take refuge in clouds and\nshadow that surrounded his strongholds. In this era, Men, the younger\nChildren of Ilúvatar, awoke in eastern Middle-earth, and some began to\nmigrate westward. The Ñoldor established kingdoms and principalities in\nnorthern and central Beleriand, which were ruled by the descendants of\nFëanor, Fingolfin and Finarfin. They built many great strongholds,\nincluding the vast cavern-city of Nargothrond, on the river Narog, and\nthe mighty hidden mountain fortress of Gondolin, ruled by Turgon, from\nwhence none who entered were permitted to leave. Many of the Sindar, the\nnative Elves of Beleriand, were absorbed into the Ñoldorin kingdoms.\nOthers were in Sindarin states: Thingol's kingdom in Doriath, the\ncoastal Falas ruled by Círdan the shipwright, and the secretive\nGreen-Elves of Ossiriand. Relations between the Ñoldor and the\nindependent Sindar were at first amicable but they later deteriorated.\nThe Ñoldor had long hidden the truth about the Kinslaying and the Curse\nfrom Thingol, but he eventually learned of it from Angrod. As a result\nhe banned all the Ñoldor (except his kin in the house of Finarfin) from\nentering Doriath, decreeing also that the Noldorin tongue could no\nlonger be spoken within his realm. A further rift between the Ñoldor and\nthe Sindar, which was to have far-reaching consequences, was caused by\nthe actions of Aredhel, daughter of Fingolfin and sister of Turgon.\nTiring of her long confinement in Gondolin, she rode east to seek out\nher old friends, the sons of Fëanor, but she was barred from crossing\nthrough Doriath by the decree of Thingol. Forced to skirt along the edge\nof the dreaded region of Nan Dungortheb (where Ungoliant had gone after\nthe escape of Morgoth), Aredhel was separated from her escort and lost.\nShe was eventually found by Eöl, the Dark Elf, a kinsman of Thingol who\nlived alone in the dark forest of Nan Elmoth. He took her as his wife,\nand they had a son, Maeglin. Eöl often traveled east to deal with the\nDwarves of the Blue Mountains, and he acquired great skill in metalwork\nfrom them, which he imparted to his son. He refused to let his wife and\nchild leave his domain, but Aredhel determined to return to Gondolin\nwith her son, so they waited until Eöl left for the east and then made\ntheir escape. Eöl pursued them to Gondolin, where he was captured and\nbrought before Turgon. Eöl demanded that Maeglin should leave with him,\nor be cursed, but Maeglin renounced his father. Turgon then decreed that\nEöl must either remain in Gondolin or die. The next day, when he was\nagain brought before Turgon, Eöl tried to kill Maeglin with a poisoned\nlance, but Aredhel stepped between them; struck in the shoulder, she\ndied that night. As punishment, Turgon had Eöl thrown to his death from\nthe walls of the fortress. Maeglin remained in Gondolin, became a mighty\nwarrior and wrought many great weapons, but his forbidden love for his\ncousin Idril Celebrindal would eventually cause him to betray Gondolin\nto Morgoth. After fifty years, and believing the Noldor to be unprepared\nfor war, Morgoth again attacked the from the north, but Fingolfin and\nMaedhros were ready for him and they defeated Morgoth's forces in the\nthird Battle, called Dagor Aglareb, pursuing the Orcs to the very gates\nof Angband and destroying them utterly. They then laid the Siege of\nAngband, which lasted for four hundred years. Almost one hundred years\nafter the Dagor Aglareb, Morgoth's forces tried to attack the realm of\nHithlum by stealing in from the far north-west, but were intercepted and\ndefeated by Fingon. After a further hundred years, Morgoth sent forth\nthe dragon Glaurung, the first of the Fire-drakes. Being only half-grown\nand not fully armoured, Glaurung was unable to withstand Fingon and his\narchers, eventually fleeing back to Angband. The period after the first\ndefeat of Glaurung became known as The Long Peace, lasting almost two\nhundred years. It was during this time, about three hundred years after\nthe Noldor had arrived in Beleriand, that Men first came into\nMiddle-earth from the regions far to the east. They first appeared in\nOssiriand, where Felagund was the first of the Noldor to see them. Over\nthe next hundred years many of them became allies of the Noldor in the\nwar against Morgoth, and settled in Noldorin realms. The Dagor\nBragollach Morgoth, however, merely used the Siege as an opportunity to\nbuild up strength, and in , renewed the war on his own terms. The fourth\nGreat Battle, Dagor Bragollach became famous for the re-emergence of the\nDragon Glaurung in his full strength. Morgoth's armies overthrew the\nSiege, slaying many of the Noldor, with Glaurung laying waste to\nArd-galen and Dorthonion. Enraged by the assaults against his people,\nFingolfin fearlessly made his way alone to the gates of Angband, where\nhe challenged Morgoth to single combat and the evil Vala was forced to\ncome out and meet him rather than appear cowardly. In the ensuing battle\nFingolfin wounded Morgoth seven times, but eventually stumbled and fell\namong the great pits created by Morgoth's hammer, Grond. Morgoth beat\nFingolfin to the ground three times with his great shield, and then\ncrushed Fingolfin under his foot, but with his dying strength Fingolfin\nslashed Morgoth's foot, maiming him. Morgoth broke Fingolfin's body and\nwas about to throw the remains to his wolves, but Thorondor, the\ngigantic king of the eagles, had been watching the battle from afar and\nat that moment flew down to rescue the body. The giant eagle gouged\nMorgoth's face with his talons, seized Fingolfin's body and carried it\nback to Gondolin for burial. After that time Morgoth's seven wounds\nnever healed, he became lame in his left foot, where Fingolfin had hewn\nit, and his face forever bore the scars of Thorondor's talons. Sixteen\nyears later, Maedhros led the northern Ñoldor and their allies among Men\nin a final desperate attempt to defeat Morgoth. In this climactic battle\n— which is named Nirnaeth Arnoediad— the forces of the Ñoldor attacked\nAngband and briefly broke through the gates, only to be beaten back when\nMorgoth unleashed his full forces, now vastly outnumbering those of\nElves and Men. Led by the terrible dragon Glaurung, Morgoth's forces\ncrushed the armies of the Ñoldor, and many of the elf lords were killed\nor captured, leaving Morgoth master of the entire North. Afterwards, he\nset about destroying the remaining Elf-kingdoms one by one. The Dagor\nBragollach was the battle in which Gil-galad left Hithlum for the Havens\nof the Falas. Beren and Lúthien The later parts of the _Quenta\nSilmarillion_ include two stories dealing with individuals and with the\nrelations between Men and Elves. The tragic yet heroic story of Beren\nand Lúthien (which has similarities to the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice)\ntells of the love between the Man Beren and Lúthien, daughter of Thingol\nand Melian and the most beautiful of all Elf Maidens. Thingol, disliking\nmortal Men and determined to prevent their marriage, declares that he\nwill consent only if Beren brings Thingol a Silmaril from Morgoth's\ncrown. Thus, in sending Beren on this perilous quest, Thingol\nunwittingly binds himself to the Doom of Mandos, ensuring his eventual\ndownfall. Travelling to the mountains of Thangorodrim in disguise, Beren\nand Lúthien succeed in making their way into Angband and to the very\nfoot of Morgoth's throne. There Lúthien reveals herself, but her beauty\nand charm enable her to briefly overcome the evil lord and she casts a\nspell that puts Morgoth and his minions to sleep. Beren then cuts one of\nthe Silmarils from Morgoth's iron crown, but when he attempts to take a\nsecond Silmaril his knife snaps and a shard flies off; it cuts Morgoth's\nface, and he begins to stir. As they leave, Morgoth and his creatures\nreawaken and Beren and Lúthien are confronted by Carcharoth, the giant\nWolf that guards the gate of Angband. Beren attempts to hold off the\nterrible creature with the power of the Silmaril, but Carcharoth bites\noff his hand and swallows the holy jewel. Driven mad by the pain it\ninflicts, the creature goes on a rampage through Doriath until it is\neventually killed by the mighty Elf-hound Huan. In this final battle\nBeren is fatally wounded by Carcharoth, so Lúthien travels in spirit to\nthe Houses of the Dead, to plead with Mandos for Beren's release. She\nand Beren are sent back to Middle-earth alive, but Lúthien becomes a\nmortal woman, so that in time they will both die and leave the Universe\ntogether. As immortals whose souls are bound to Arda for as long as it\nlasts, Thingol and Melian suffer the grief of being deprived of their\ndaughter for all time. Túrin Turambar _Main article: Túrin Turambar_\n_See also: The Children of Húrin_ Also included is the story of Túrin\nTurambar. His father Húrin is captured at the end of the Battle of\nUnnumbered Tears, and for his defiance, Morgoth places a curse on his\nfamily. Túrin becomes a great hero, but due partly to his hot temper and\npartly to a string of bad luck (in fact, the working of Morgoth's\ndemonic will), whatever he turns his hand to seems to go wrong, and\ndeath and grief haunt those around him. Making matters worse, both Túrin\nand his sister Niënor are enchanted by the mighty dragon Glaurung — who\nhas sacked the great Elf-city of Nargothrond and taken up residence\nthere — and they fall in love and live for time as man and wife.\nEventually Túrin kills Glaurung, but with his death the spell is lifted.\nDriven mad by the realisation of their sins, Túrin and Nienor both\ncommit suicide. Gondolin The last Elf-Kingdom to fall was the hidden\ncity of Gondolin. Tuor, a mortal man, was sent by Ulmo as a messenger to\nGondolin, to warn King Turgon of the city's impending destruction.\nRemaining in Gondolin, Tuor married Turgon's daughter, Idril, and they\nhad a son Eärendil. Gondolin was eventually betrayed to Morgoth by\nMaeglin, and destroyed. Turgon fell during the battle and the High\nKingship passed to Gil-galad, who dwelt at the Mouth of Sirion. Tuor,\nIdril and Eärendil escaped, together with a number of refugees. Growing\nup, Eärendil married Elwing, granddaughter of Beren and Lúthien and\ncurrent keeper of the Silmaril they took from Morgoth. With the help of\nthe Silmaril, Eärendil and Elwing sailed to Valinor to plead with the\nValar, asking them to pardon the Noldor and assist Elves and Men in\ntheir need. The Valar agreed to this request, and set Eärendil, with the\nSilmaril, to sail the skies as a star until the ending of the world.\nBattle between Morgoth and the Host of the Valar The Host of the Valar,\nled by Eönwë, finally attacked Morgoth in Angband. In this battle, the\nGreat Battle (also known as the War of Wrath), Morgoth was utterly\ndefeated; his armies were destroyed, with only a few remnants scattered\nacross the Earth. He was taken prisoner and his two remaining Silmarils\nwere confiscated. Maedhros and Maglor, Fëanor's two surviving sons,\nstole the Silmarils from Eönwë, but they found the Silmarils would not\ntolerate their touch, instead tormenting them with burning pain.\nMaedhros committed suicide by jumping with the Silmaril into a chasm in\nthe earth, and Maglor threw his Silmaril away into the sea. The Valar\npardoned the Ñoldor for their rebellion, and the Teleri offered\nforgiveness for the Kinslaying. Many of the Ñoldor and the Sindar left\nMiddle-earth and traveled into the West, to live in Valinor. Many more\nfollowed Gil-galad and stayed in Middle-earth. Morgoth was cast out of\nthe World, imprisoned in the Void that lies behind the Walls of Night.\nThe Silmarils were lost “unless the World be broken and re-made”, but\neach one found its home in one of the elements: sky, water, and earth."

    "text": "The AKALLABÊTH is the fourth part of _The Silmarillion_, and the primary\naccount of the downfall of Númenor_._ It is relatively short, consisting\nof about thirty pages. The story is written in the voice of Pengolodh,\nand is one of the more significant stories associated with Ælfwine.\nSynopsis Akallabêth (_The Downfallen_ in Adûnaic; Quenya is ''Atalantë;\n''Mar-nu-Falmar as another Quenya name.) is the story of the destruction\nof the Kingdom of Númenor, as written by Elendil. At the end of the\nFirst Age (described in detail in the _Quenta Silmarillion_), those of\nMen who had been helping Elves in their fight against Melkor were given\na new small continent of their own, free from the evil and sadness of\nMiddle-earth. It was located in the middle of the Great Ocean, between\nthe western shores of Middle-earth, and the eastern shores of Aman,\nwhere the Valar dwelt. As they entered Númenor, the race of Men was\nforbidden to set sail towards Aman, they gladly agreed to this because\nthey regarded mortality as a gift and did not envy the Valar and Elves\nwho could not die. For two and a half thousand years Númenor grew in\nmight; Númenórian ships sailed the seas and established remote colonies,\nsome of them in Middle-earth. During that time the Elves of Middle-earth\nwere engaged in a bitter fight with Morgoth's former servant Sauron, who\nhad turned into a Dark Lord himself. The Elves asked for the help of the\nNúmenórians and they agreed but as time went on, over the course of one\nand half thousand years, Men desired immortality and rebelled against\nthe Valar and the Elves. Their second last king, Tar Palantir, tried to\namend the evil but it was too late. During this time, Númenor grew even\nmore powerful. The last king, Ar-Pharazôn, wanted control of\nMiddle-earth, and so he attacked Sauron. Sauron's armies became afraid\nof the might of Númenor, and so he was captured and brought imprisoned\nto the Númenórian king. However, Sauron exploited his power to corrupt\nthe Númenorian king to his will. Soon he became his adviser, and much of\nNúmenor obeyed his will and worshipped Morgoth. Sauron convinced\nAr-Pharazôn to try to assail Aman for immortality, desiring to destroy\nNúmenor with the wrath of the Valar. However as this was done, the Valar\nappealed to Eru Ilúvatar. Eru destroyed the Númenórian host, by crushing\nit under stones; however, he also caused the whole of Númenor to sink\nunder the Great Ocean. Just a few men of Númenórian royal blood,\ndescendants of a long line called “The Faithful” because they were\nuncorrupted by Sauron, had fled Númenor by ships earlier with some gifts\nthat Men received from the Valar and the Elves in times of peace. They\nwere led by Elendil the Tall, and his two sons: Isildur and Anárion.\nThey set sail to Middle-earth, where the followers of Elendil\nestablished two kingdoms, which were managed as Númenórian provinces:\nGondor in the south and Arnor in the North. Some of the King's Men,\nenemies of Elendil, established other realms in exile to the south; of\nthese Umbar was the chief. The culture of Númenor became the dominant\nculture of Middle-earth (thus, Westron, a descendant of the Adûnaic\nlanguage of Númenor became the lingua franca). The sadness and the shock\nfrom the loss of a whole continent lived ever after in the hearts of\nkings of Númenórian descent. Arda was made spherical, and Aman was put\nfurther beyond Middle-earth, out of the reach of mortal men. Sauron,\nalthough greatly diminished and bereft of shape, escaped Númenor and\nreturned to Middle-earth once more. Textual history The story originated\nwith _The Lost Road_, an abandoned time-travel novel. It was later\nadapted into back-story for _The Lord of the Rings_. Interpretation As\nthe Quenya name makes obvious, this is a retelling of the story of the\nlost city of Atlantis, in the Middle-earth cadre. “Atalantë” is Quenya\nfor “Downfallen”. Canon Christopher Tolkien notes in _The Peoples of\nMiddle-earth_ that in the final version of Akallabêth, written by his\nfather, the work is written in the voice of Pengolodh, and that the\nstory was originally addressed to Ælfwine by him. The authentic text\nbegan: “Of Men, Ælfwine, it is said by the Eldar that they came into the\nworld in the time of the Shadow of Morgoth ...” Christopher then admits\nthat this removal made the whole source lose its anchorage in Eldarin\nlore, and he believed he used poor judgment and excessive vigilance,\nwhich also led him to alterations of the end of the paragraph (perhaps\neditorial work that was not his to properly make, as he went against his\nfather's original intent). Christopher also points out that the last\nparagraph of Akallabêth, as published in _The Silmarillion_, still\ncontains indirect references to Ælfwine, the 'Straight Road' and other\n'future mariners', which he never altered or removed."

The Crissaegrim formed a part of the southern\nEchoriath, which were the _Encircling Mountains_ of Gondolin. Etymology\n_Crissaegrim_ is Sindarin for “cleft mountain peaks”, but in Tolkien's\nstories the place is usually referred to as CIRITH THORONATH, the\n“Eagles' Cleft”, or “Abode of Eagles” because the peaks were\ninaccessible from the ground."

    "title": "Ungoliant",
    "page_id": "2378",
    "text": "UNGOLIANT (Sindarin IPA: - “Dark Spider”) was a primordial taking the\nshape of a gigantic spider. She was initially an ally of Melkor in Aman,\nand for a short time in Middle-earth as well. She is the mother of\nShelob, and therefore the oldest, and first spider of the south,\npossibly even the first spider of Arda. Biography Origins The true\norigin of Ungoliant is unknown, and was not even known by the Valar. It\nis said by some that she came from the Darkness itself that lies about\nArda and was once an ally of Melkor when he looked down upon the world\nwith envy. Later, she changed her allegiance from him to herself,\ndesiring only to be a mistress of her own insatiable craving to devour\nall light - to feed her everlasting emptiness. Early years When Melkor\nwas defeated and imprisoned by the Lords of the West after the first\nElves awoke in Cuiviénen, Ungoliant escaped the attacks of the Valar and\nthe hunters of Oromë and fled to the southern part of Aman. There, in a\nravine south of the mountain Hyarmentir, she established her dark abode\nand took the physical form of a monstrous spider, and sucked up all the\nlight she could find. After every feeding, she spun forth dark nets of\ngloom that strangled any light from entering her lair of darkness. Yet\nshe hungered for more of it: for although she hated light, she craved\nits sustenance as well. Alliance with Melkor Eventually, Melkor sought\nout Ungoliant in order to exact his revenge against the Valar and the\nElves. He came to her and told her of his plans. Though she was tempted\ngreatly by Melkor's plan for her to drink the light of the Two Trees of\nValinor, she feared the power of the Valar and was hesitant to accompany\nhim. To mollify her, Melkor offered to sate her hunger with whatever she\nwished if she would aid him in his vengeance. She agreed, and they came\nshortly thereafter to Ezellohar, where she drained the Trees of their\nsap, poisoned them, and drank the Wells of Varda dry. The Unlight\nproduced by Ungoliant stymied the pursuit of Oromë and Tulkas, and\nMelkor escaped to Middle-earth with her. However, her consumption of\npower of the Trees and the Wells caused her to swell to a size and shape\nso vast and hideous that even Melkor began to grow afraid. When they\narrived in Lammoth in Middle-earth, Melkor, now known as Morgoth, hoped\nto escape to the ruins of Angband where the remnants of his forces\nawaited him. Suspecting that he intended to leave his promise to her\nunfulfilled, Ungoliant demanded the gems that Morgoth had stolen from\nFormenos before they could reach Angband. She devoured them, and grew to\nan even more monstrous size. She then demanded that Morgoth surrender to\nher the Silmarils. However, Morgoth refused, and she attacked him.\nWeaving her dark webs, she attempted to enmesh him in her nets and take\nthe Silmarils by force. Morgoth gave out a terrible cry of pain as she\nattacked, which was heard by the Balrogs hibernating under the ruins of\nAngband. They awoke and immediately rushed to the aid of their Lord,\ntearing apart Ungoliant's webbing with their fiery whips and forcing her\nto break off her attack. She fled, and the Balrogs prepared to pursue\nand destroy her, but they were checked by Morgoth, who ordered them to\nreturn with him to Angband. Ungoliant's attack upon Morgoth left an\nechoing scream ever after on the land that gave the area the name\nLammoth, and it is said to this day that when one screams in that place,\nthe voice of the Dark Lord echoes back from the surrounding hills. Final\nYears and Legacy Driven off by the Balrogs, Ungoliant fled to Nan\nDungortheb, where she bred with the Great Spiders that dwelt there,\nincreasing the terror and power of her kind. The creatures that later\ninfested the area were her surviving offspring and descendants,\nincluding her infamous daughter, Shelob, who dwelt from the Second and\nThird Ages onwards on the borders of Mordor, as her last surviving\nchild. It is said that Ungoliant ultimately perished at her own hands\nwhen, in her ever growing and eternal hunger, she eventually devoured\nherself. Others say Ungoliant, after retreating to an isolated island in\nthe Belegaer, was slain by Eärendil, and with her darkness destroyed,\nlight came to many regions from which it had long been hid. Towards the\nend of the First Age, she had captured the sun (Arien/Urwendi) with her\ngloom nets and Earendil encountered her on his journey across the seas\non the Vingilot. Earendil ultimately freed Urwendi freeing the Magic\nSun.Similarly, Tolkien projected a tale wherein Ungoliant ensnared the\nSun in her webs while it sailed under the earth: with the result that\nthe Sun was no longer enchanted, only the Moon: Urwendi imprisoned by\nMóru (upset out of the boat by Melko and only the Moon has been magic\nsince). The Faring Forth and the Battle of Erumáni would release her and\nrekindle the Magic Sun. Tolkien, J. R. R.; John D. Rateliff.

    "text": "OSSIRIAND (Sindarin IPA: ) was a region of the eastern Beleriand. It was\nalso known as the LAND OF SEVEN RIVERS. Description Ossiriand was the\nmost eastern region of Beleriand during the First Age, lying between the\nBlue Mountains and the river Gelion. Along the northern shore of the\nAscar ran the Dwarf-Road to Nogrod. The region was warm and gentle, with\nconiferous woodlands. Seven rivers lay in the region of Ossiriand, and\nthese are (from north to south): 1. River _Gelion_ 2. River _Ascar_ or\n_Rathlóriel_ 3. River _Thalos_ 4. River _Legolin_ 5. River _Brilthor_ 6.\nRiver _Duilwen_ 7. River _Adurant_ History Ossiriand was a green and\nforested land, and it was not populated by the Sindar. In the early\nFirst Age before the rise of the Moon, a part of the Telerin elven\npeople called Nandor entered Ossiriand under their leader King Denethor,\nand were given permission by Thingol to settle the lands. After them the\nland was often renamed Lindon, for _The Singers_, after the old\nclan-name of the Telerin which the Nandor still used in their tongue.\nThey became known as the Laiquendi, or Green-Elves. The Elves of\nOssiriand participated in the first battle of the Wars of Beleriand.\nAfter their leader Denethor was killed in an orc-raid they chose no more\nleaders, and many of them moved to Doriath. After the Quest for the\nSilmaril, Beren and Lúthien lived their second lives in Dor\nFirn-i-Guinar on Tol Galen. In FA 470, their son Dior was born here.\nAfter the death of Thingol, Beren laid an attack against the Dwarves of\nNogrod, leading an army of Nandorin Elves and Ents. Ossiriand was the\nonly part of Beleriand that survived the War of Wrath, but Belegaer the\nGreat Sea broke through the mountain chain at the former riverbed of\nAscar, creating the Gulf of Lhûn. In the Second Age and Third Age, the\nformer lands of Ossiriand and Thargelion were known as LINDON, where\nGil-galad the High King ruled. Etymology The name OSSIRIAND means “Land\nof the Seven Rivers”, from the Quenya _otso_ (“seven”), Sindarin _sîr_\n(“river”), and '' -ian(d)'', which is commonly used in the names of\nregions or countries. Other versions of the legendarium While conceiving\na name, J.R.R. Tolkien had numerous choices for this land. He originally\nwrote Broseliand (which eventually led to Beleriand). The other names\nwere Colodhinand, Ñoldorinan, Geleriand, Bladorinand, Belaurien,\nArsiriand, Lassiriand, Ossiriand.",

The land\nconsisted of well known places like the Wold, which were both short and\ntall grasslands. History The region was the site of the death of Eorl\nthe Young in a battle with the Easterlings in the Wold. In the past many\nherdsman and horse-lords wandered freely throughout this land in\ntemporary tent camps, but by the time of the War of the Ring they were\nempty. There were few fixed settlements here, but many of the herdsmen\nof the Rohirrim lived a nomadic existence on the fields of the\nEastemnet, living out of temporary camps and driving their herds across\nthe grasslands.

    "title": "Thangorodrim",
    "page_id": "2404",
    "text": "THANGORODRIM was a group of three gigantic active volcanoes within the\nIron Mountains in the north of Middle-earth during the First Age. They\nwere raised by Morgoth, who delved his fortress of Angband beneath them\nand far back into the Iron Mountains. They were the highest peaks in all\nof Middle Earth. History Thangorodrim was made up of three volcanoes of\nwhich were said to have been crafted by Morgoth from the slag and debris\nof the re-delving of Angband during the First Age. The mountains\nthemselves were of little consequence during Morgoth's rule of Angband,\nsave to occasionally spew forth fire and magma when Morgoth was either\nexceptionally wrathful or on the warpath. After the death of his father,\nMaedhros was taken prisoner and nailed to a cliff of Thangorodrim as a\nmethod of torture. He was rescued by his cousin Fingon with the help of\nThorondor, King of the Eagles. After his family was cursed by Morgoth,\nHúrin was imprisoned in a chair on a high terrace to watch the curse\nunfold. For a time immediately after the creation of Thangorodrim, the\nGreat Eagles made their eyries on the three mountains at the command of\nManwë in order to bring him news of Morgoth's doings. However, at some\ntime during the First Age the Eagles moved to the Crissaegrim near\nGondolin. At the base of the south face of the middle peak was the Great\nGate of Angband, a deep canyon leading into the mountain, lined with\ntowers and forts. There were also a number of secret gates scattered\naround the sides of the mountain group, from which Morgoth's hosts could\nissue forth and surprise their foes. Thangorodrim was destroyed during\nthe War of Wrath at the end of the First Age when Ancalagon, freshly\nslain by Eärendil fell dead on the peaks and crushed them to rubble.\nSize and Height The exact size and height of Thangorodrim are unclear,\nthough they were said to have been the tallest mountains in\nMiddle-earth. One drawing by Tolkien illustrated in Karen Wynn Fonstad's\n_The Atlas of Middle-earth_, if drawn to scale, would have made each\nmountain 35,000 ft high and five miles across, and the statement that it\nlay 150 leagues (450 Númenórean miles) north of Menegroth puts it too\nfar away for some of the action in _The Silmarillion_ to make sense; a\ndistance of 150-200 miles would have been more consistent. It is\npossible that with the higher figure Tolkien was not referring to 'as\nthe eagle flies', but rather 'as the wolf runs': the plateau of\nDorthonion forced a long detour, which added the extra 200, 250 miles to\nthe distance. Etymology _THANGORODRIM_ was a Sindarin word that tied\ntogether the roots 'oppression', 'mountain', and 'group'; together\nmeaning roughly 'Oppressive peaks'."

    "text": "TULKAS (Quenya; IPA: - “Strong” or “Steadfast”) is an Ainu, a Vala who\nwas responsible for participating in war and the last of them to descend\ninto Arda, coming to the aid of the others when he heard of their war\nwith Melkor. He was also called TULUKASTĀZ or ASTALDO. Biography Having\nheard of his fellow Valar's struggle against Melkor, Tulkas was the last\nof the Valar to descend upon Arda, thus tipping the scales of battle\nagainst Melkor. Melkor fled before him, and the Spring of Arda was\nbegun. After the Two Lamps were erected and the Valar had made their\nfirst dwelling at Almaren, Tulkas wedded Nessa in a great feast. Being\nweary and content he slept, and Melkor decided his hour to retaliate had\ncome. When the Children of Ilúvatar awoke, there was a council among the\nValar regarding Melkor. Much to Tulkas's delight, it was decided that\nMelkor should be removed. During the War for Sake of the Elves, he\nwrestled with Melkor and bound him with Angainor, which was forged by\nAulë. Upon Melkor's release from captivity, Tulkas remained vigilant and\ndistrustful of him. Character Tulkas is described as delighting in\nwrestling and contests of strength. He wields no weapon, and rides no\nsteed. As he cares little about either past or future, he was not a good\ncouncillor, but nonetheless a very hardy friend. He is described as\nbeing slow to wrath, but also slow to forgive; for that reason, he was\none of the Valar that opposed the release of Melkor. In appearance,\nTulkas was described to have ruddy flesh and golden hair and beard. He\nalso tended to be impatient; before the Awakening of the Elves he urged\nthe other Valar to wage war against Melkor. After the Darkening of\nValinor he also hurried Fëanor to take a decision about surrendering the\nSilmarils. Tulkas was known for laughing in sport and in battle. He was\npossibly the only being on Arda with the courage to laugh in the face of\nMelkor, the most powerful being in Valinor (at the time) - and did so\nonce while engaged in battle with him. Despite not being one of the\nAratar, Morgoth feared Tulkas more than any of the other Valar. He was\nalso the strongest (physically) of all the Valar. Most likely, he was\nphysically stronger than Morgoth, as it was he who first chained him\nwith Angainor. Etymology In Quenya, the name _TULKAS_ means “Strong” and\n“Steadfast”, from the root _tuluk_. His Valarin name is TULUKHASTĀZ,\nwhich means “the golden-haired”, from the words _tulukha(n)_ (“yellow”)\nand _(a)sata-_ (“hair of head”). His Ñoldorin name is TULCUS (“Strong”).\nASTALDO means “the Valiant”. Other names An earlier name for Tulkas was\nTURENBO. Earlier versions of the legendarium In earlier texts, Tulkas\noverthrows Melkor during the battle of the Silent Pools and bounds him\nfor Lumbi. Here, the Hound of Mandos, Gorgumoth, guards Melkor in his\ncaptivity. In an earlier context, Tulkas had a son Telimektar, “whose\ntale is yet to tell”. Gallery",

    "text": "MANDOS (Quenya; IPA: - “Prison-Fortress”) is an Ainu, one of the Aratar\nand a Vala who is responsible for the judgement of the Spirits, or Fëa\nof all Elven dead. He also has responsibility for pronouncing the dooms\nand judgments of Eru Ilúvatar under Manwë. His real name is NÁMO\n(Quenya; IPA: “Ordainer” or “Judge”) but was later known by the Elves as\nMandos after his sacred Halls of Mandos, over which he presides and\nwhere ultimately the Elves go after they are slain. Mandos was the sixth\ngreatest of the Lords of the Valar, and fifth greatest Aratar. Biography\nMandos was the brother of Irmo (Lórien) and Nienna in the mind of Eru\nIlúvatar. He and his brother Lórien are the Fëanturi, the MASTERS OF\nSPIRITS. His wife was Vaire the Weaver. He it was who pronounced Manwë's\nDoom concerning the espousals of the Eldar on YT 1172, when Finwë asked\ncounsel for a second marriage, after the death of his wife's passing to\nthe Halls of Mandos. When Melkor began marring Arda before the coming of\nthe Elves, Tulkas arrived and wanted to make war swiftly. At the bidding\nof Manwë, Mandos pronounced the doom of the Firstborn. After the\ncaptivity of Melkor, Mandos had once again pronounced the Doom. Melkor\nspent three Ages in the duress of Mandos thereafter, guarded by his\nhound Gorgumoth in Lumbi. Mandos judged Fëanor to leave Tirion for\ntwelve years after Fëanor's drawing of sword against Fingolfin. After\nthe destruction of the Two Trees, Yavanna asked for the light of the\nSilmarils, which Fëanor denied and he shall be slain, the first in Aman;\nbut Mandos had spoken and revealed that Finwë was the first, having been\nslain at the steps of Formenos by Melkor. When the Ñoldor revolted\nagainst the Valar, Mandos appeared before them and pronounced the Doom\nof the Ñoldor. Only once has he been moved to pity, when Lúthien sang of\nthe grief she and her lover Beren had experienced in Beleriand. Then,\nwith the Elder King's approval, he released them to Middle-earth to\nbegin their second life there as mortal beings with no certitude of\nlife. When Eärendil arrived in Aman to beg for assistance from the\nValar, Mandos considered Eärendil and Elwing's fate as Half-elven and\ngave them and their descendants a choice: either to be counted among\nElves or Men. Character Mandos, upon appearing before the Ñoldor, was\nreferred to be a dark figure with a loud voice, solemn and terrible. He\nwas described as being stern, dispassionate and never forgetting a\nthing. He was the Vala who cursed the Ñoldor leaving Aman, and\ncounselled against allowing them to return. But unlike Morgoth, his\nDooms are not cruel or vindictive by his own design. They are simply the\nwill of Eru, and he will not speak them unless he is commanded to do so\nby Manwë. Etymology His common name _MANDOS_ means “Prison-fortress”. It\nstems from _Mandost_ (“castle of custody”) or _mbando_ (“custody”) and\n_osto_ (“fortified building or place”). His real name, NÁMO, means\n“Ordainer” or “Judge” in Quenya. Other Names The Old English translation\nfor Mandos is NEFREA “Corpse-ruler” from _neo_ (“corpse”) and _frea_\n(“lord”). His title is NEOAERNA HLAFORD (“Master of the houses of the\ndead”). He was also called MORIMANDO, the “Dark Mando”, as opposed to\nManwë's _Kalamando_, the “Light Mando”. In Tolkien's earlier work,\nMandos was named VEFANTUR. Other versions of the legendarium As\nVefantur, his wife was Fui Nienna and together they were called the\n“Gods of Death”. Their halls were located beneath the roots of the\nMountains of Valinor.",

She was known as _VÁNA THE EVER-YOUNG_. \nBiography Vána was the younger sister of Yavanna (_Queen of the Earth_)\nand the wife of Oromë (_Huntsman of the Valar_). In Vána's dwellings she\nhad gardens filled with golden flowers; and often, Vána came to the\nforests of Oromë. Like her sister, the province of Vána was growing\nthings of the world and she was a lover of nature. Vána had influence\nwith the flora and fauna of Middle-earth, and she was associated\nespecially with flowers thus Vána was also known as the “Queen of\nFlowers”. It was said that when the Valar Tulkas & Nessa were wedded on\nthe Isle of Almaren, the first dwelling of the Valar, Vána robed her\nsister-in-law _Nessa the Swift_ (sister of Oromë) with her flowers. In\nthe Days of the Two Trees of Valinor, Arien of the Maiar, before she\ncame to carry the vessel of the Sun, had served Vána by tending to the\ngolden flowers of Vána's gardens watering them with bright dews from the\ngreat golden Tree Laurelin. Melian also was another Maia who initially\nserved Vána before she departed for Middle-earth. After the Darkening of\nValinor and the flight of the Noldor to Middle-Earth, most of the Valar\nwere glad to have their ancient peace back, wishing neither the rumors\nof Melkor and his violence nor the murmur of the restless Noldor to come\nupon them again. Thus for such reasons, they clamored for the\nconcealment of their land Aman. It was said that Vána was one among\nthem. Character According to _The Silmarillion_, “All flowers spring as\nVána passes and opens if she glances upon them; and all birds sing at\nher coming.” Vána robed herself in flowers and it was said that her hair\nwas golden in color. Vána had the beauty of both heaven and earth upon\nher face and in all her works. Like Nessa, Vána also sang and danced\nalong with her maidens. The Maiar of Vána - Arien, the Maia who guided\nthe Sun, was one of her Maiar in Valinor. - Melian, who later in\nMiddle-earth became Queen of Doriath by marrying the Elf-King Thingol.\nEtymology The name _VÁNA_ may have been derived from the Quenya word\n_vanima_ (“beautiful”), as she is often described as “fair”. Hence she\nwas also known as _VÁNA THE FAIR_.",

She was notable for her speed, being fast “as\nan arrow in movement”, for which reason she was called _NESSA THE\nSWIFT_. Biography Nessa was the sister of Oromë. She was lithe and swift\nof foot and Nessa loved fast moving creatures such as deer. And the deer\nfollowed her train wherever she went even into the wild regions of Aman.\nNessa could outrun the deer with great speed with the wind in her hair.\nNessa married Tulkas aka _TULKAS THE STRONG_, during the Spring of Arda.\nBefore the destruction of the _Isle of Almaren_, the first dwelling of\nthe Valar, Nessa delighted in dancing and would often dance on the great\ngreen grass of Almaren; and later, in Valinor on never-fading green\nlawns. Henceforth, as the Valar had finished with their labours in the\ncreation of Arda, King Manwë ordained a great feast on Almaren. So the\nValar were gathered upon Almaren during the _Spring of Arda_; and it was\nsung that on this great feast, Nessa wedded Tulkas there at that time\nwhere Nessa's sister-in-law, _Vána the Ever-young_,'' ''wife of Oromë,\nrobed Nessa with her flowers. Thereon, Nessa danced before the Valar\nupon the green grass of Almaren. The dwelling of Nessa and Tulkas was\nsaid to be a house full of mirth and revelry. For in the House of\nTulkas, his warriors played and rivaled one another there in doughty\nfeats. At times, Nessa would bear goblets of wine and cooling drinks\namong the champions of her husband. After the flight of the Ñoldor to\nMiddle-earth, like most of the Valar, Nessa also desired ease and peace\njust like the ancient days of Valinor. Wishing not for the rumour of\nMelkor nor for the murmurs of the Ñoldor to come ever again among them\nand disturb their happiness. As a result for such reasons, most of the\nValar clamored for the concealment of their land. Hence, the Hiding of\nValinor took place. Etymology NESSA comes from the Quenya _neth_\n(“young”). Other names Two earlier names for Nessa were HELINYETILLE,\nthe “Eyes of Heartsease”, from _helin_ (“violet, pansy”), and MELESTA,\nfrom _mele_ (“to love”). Character Nessa loved most to retire to the\nfair ever-green lawns of Valinor which Oromë had cultivated from the\nrichness of all his forest glades. For it was told that, when Yavanna\n(_Queen of the Earth_) created the forests of Oromë, she had planted\nthere these forest glades with spells so that these glades would always\nremain green and smooth. There in the fair lawns of Valinor, Nessa along\nwith her maidens would dance as long as the great golden Tree Laurelin''\n_was in bloom._'' It was told that she herself was a greater dancer than\nVána, for Nessa was not just known for her notable speed but for her\ndancing abilities as well. Other Versions in the Legendarium In the\nearlier texts, Nessa and Estë were considered “highest among the Maiar”.\nLea the Young was the wife of Tulkas, and was later changed to Nessa.\nNessa was once envisioned as the daughter of Vána.

He was the brother of Nessa and the\nhusband of Vána. Biography During the Years of the Trees, after most of\nthe Valar had withdrawn completely from Middle-earth and hidden\nthemselves in Aman, Oromë still hunted in the forests of Middle-earth on\noccasion. Thus, it was he who discovered the Elves when they first awoke\nat Cuivienen and named them the _Eldar_ . Thereafter he remained close\nin friendship with them. A powerful huntsman, he was active in the\nstruggles against Morgoth. He had a great horn called the Valaróma and a\ngreat steed named Nahar. Huan, a Hound from Valinor, once belonged to\nhim but was later given to Celegorm, one of the Sons of Fëanor.\nEtymology _OROMË_ means “Horn-blowing” and “Sound of Horns”, and is\nderived from the Valarin name ARÔMÊZ. _ARAW_ is the Sindarin translation\nof Oromë. The Sindar additionally referred to him as _TAURON_, which\nmeans “Lord of the Forests” and “The Forester.” It is possible that the\nname comes from the Sindarin _taur_ (“forest”) or the Quenyan _taure_\n(“great wood”). Other names In the Old English translation of Eriol,\nOromë is called WADFREA (“The Huntinglord”), HUNTENA FREA (“Lord of\nHunters”), and WEALDAFREA (“Lord of Forests”).

A lover of\nwater, Ulmo was one of the Arda's chief architects and was always in a\nclose friendship with Manwë. He always distrusted Melkor, and the Dark\nLord feared the Sea almost as much as he feared Varda because the sea\ncannot be tamed. Ulmo had no dwelling in Valinor or any permanent\ndwelling on land, as he preferred the deeps of the seas and the rivers.\nHis palace, on the bottom of Vaiya, was called Ulmonan. Biography Ulmo\nseldom came to the Councils of Máhanaxar, and only when in great need.\nHe preferred to stay in Arda, not by walking on the land, as his form\nwould fill man or elf with great dread. All waters were under his\ngovernment: bays, rivers and even the waters under the earth. Where the\npower of Morgoth was strong, however, Ulmo's own power would be sapped\nfrom waters near to Morgoth's corruption. It is through the rivers that\nhe kept in touch with Arda, and thus knew more of the goings on with the\nChildren of Ilúvatar than even Manwë, for in that way he lived in the\nvery veins of the world. His visible form caused fear in mortals and\neven the Elves, as he dressed like a giant wave in glittering green\narmour, blowing his great horns, the Ulumúri. Ulmo always loved the\nEldar and the Edain, even when the Valar forsook Middle-earth. He\nopposed Oromë's plan to bring the elves to Aman, but helped those that\nwere willing to reach it. He uprooted a large island which was later\nknown as Tol Eressëa and used it to ferry them across the Belegaer to\nthe Blessed Realm. Afterwards, he anchored it in the Bay of Eldamar,\nwhich he did because he knew the minds of the Teleri. Ulmo was the Vala\nmost responsible for the fall of Morgoth, by urging Turgon to build\nGondolin and Finrod to build Nargothrond (FA 50). He appeared before\nTuor and urged him to go to Gondolin as a messenger to Turgon. When he\ngot there, he eventually married Turgon's daughter Idril and fathered\nEärendil. Ulmo saved Eärendil's wife Elwing from the sack of the Havens\nof Sirion, allowing her to take a Silmaril to her husband, which allowed\nhim to gain admittance to Valinor and plead for aid. Ulmo also defended\nthem in the council from the potential wrath of Mandos.

It is unknown whether this whale was actually an Ainur to have\nshape like other races of possible Ainur such as the Great Eagles.\nThrough these Maiar, Ulmo learned much of the Elves.

She was the sister of Mandos and Irmo and had no\nspouse. Her part in the Music of the Ainur was one of deep sadness, from\nwhich grief entered the world at its beginning. She had dominion over\nthe Halls of Nienna, which were on the western edge of Valinor, looking\nover the sea. Biography Nienna was concerned with mourning, and she\npitied the suffering of others, especially the Marring of Arda by\nMelkor. Yet the lesson of Nienna is not of endless grief, but rather of\npity, hope, and the endurance of the spirit. Nienna dwelt in far western\nValinor near Mandos, and she seldom came to Valimar. Her windows looked\nout beyond the Walls of the Night. During the creation of the Two Trees,\nshe watered the mound with her tears. The pity of Nienna is most clearly\nseen in her support for Melkor when he sued for the pardon of the Valar.\nThough she spent her time in the world mourning for the destruction he\nhad wreaked in Arda, when he sued for release after his three ages of\nCaptivity, Nienna spoke on his behalf. After the Flight of the Ñoldor,\nNienna mourned for the destruction of the Two Trees, and her tears\nbrought healing, but could not heal the mortal wounds. Thus, the trees\nbrought forth their last flower and fruit, and made into the Sun and\nMoon. All that is known about her appearance is that she wore a grey\nhood. Given that Gandalf was her greatest student, his being clothed in\ngrey may have been a mark of respect to his teacher. Maiar of Nienna -\nOlórin (Gandalf), Nienna's greatest pupil among all the others who dwell\nin the Halls of Awaiting. She taught him pity and many other things\nbefore he was chosen as the second wizard sent to lead the people of\nMiddle-earth into standing against Sauron. Etymology _NIENNA_ means\n''weeping ''or ''she who weeps _in Quenya and_ _comes_ ''from the root\n_nei_ (“tear”). Other versions of the legendarium In earlier versions,\nNienna was the sister of Manwë and Melkor, and was called “queen of\nshadow”. In _The Book of Lost Tales 1_, a character similar to Nienna\nwas called FUI (Night), the Death-Goddess. In Gnomish she was FUIL, the\nQueen of the Dark. She dwelt in halls that bore her name, and had a roof\nof bats' wings. As _Fui_, she was the spouse of Vefantur (Mandos in\nTolkien's later writings) and dwelt in his halls of Ve. She judged the\nhumans while Vefantur judged the elves. HESKIL (Winter One) and NÚRI\n(One who Sighs) were her names as well. She was also called QALME-TARI\n(Mistress of Death).

Biography Thorondor was sent by Manwë, King of the Valar, to\nwatch over the Ñoldor after they arrived in Beleriand.

    "text": "The NÍRNAETH ARNOEDIAD (“BATTLE OF UNNUMBERED TEARS”) was the fifth\ngreat battle against Morgoth that took place in the First Age. History\nAlmost twenty years after the defeat of the Elves and their Edain allies\nin the Dagor Bragollach, the Noldor had lost control over the entire\nnorth of Beleriand, and were for the most part reduced to holding on\ndefensively in Hithlum, Himring and Nargothrond. Gondolin was still\nhidden and could not yet be assailed. However, the deeds of Beren and\nLúthien, defeating Sauron at Tol-in-Gaurhoth and retrieving a Silmaril\nfrom Angband, convinced Maedhros that Morgoth was not invincible. In the\nyear 468 of the Years of the Sun in the First Age, Maedhros began\nbuilding an alliance that he believed capable of taking the war to\nThangorodrim, known as the Union of Maedhros. Under the command of\nMaedhros, all the Elves of Beleriand, as well as the Edain, Dwarves, and\nthe newly arrived Easterlings were invited to combine in arms and fight\nagainst Morgoth. Unfortunately, the Oath of Fëanor and the evil deeds\ndone by the Sons of Fëanor to fulfill it caused the Union to have less\nstrength than it could have had. For Orodreth, the Lord of Nargothrond,\nremembering the deeds of Celegorm and Curufin that indirectly resulted\nin the death of Lord Finrod Felagund, sent no aid to the alliance.\nAgainst Orodreth's will however, a small company under the command of\nGwindor went from Nargothrond. Their hope was to avenge the capture of\nGwindor's brother Gelmir during the Dagor Bragollach. Worse yet, from\nDoriath there came only Mablung and Beleg, who wished to take part in\nthe great deeds they knew were to come. For Thingol, King of Doriath,\nhad in his possession the Silmaril recovered by Beren and Lúthien, and\nthe Sons of Fëanor sent to him a haughty demand for its surrender.\nThingol however, was both insulted by the demand and had begun to lust\nfor the Silmaril. Thus, against the counsel of Melian, he refused to\nsurrender it. As a result, Celegorm and Curufin vowed openly to destroy\nDoriath should they emerge victorious from the battle against Morgoth.\nTherefore Thingol enhanced the guard at his borders and sent no troops\nto aid Maedhros. The Union divided its strength into two separate forces\nto attack Angband. Under Maedhros in the east were gathered the\nremainder of the Sons of Fëanor, the Elves and Men of Himring under\nMaedhros and Bór, the men of Amon ereb under Caranthir and Ulfang, and\nthe Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost. Under Fingon in the west were\ngathered the Elves and Men of Hithlum, the Elves of the Falas, the\nHaladin of Brethil, the companies sent from Nargothrond and the two\nElves of Doriath, Beleg and Mablung. The plan was for Maedhros's host,\nthe slightly greater of the two, to march openly across Anfauglith and\ndraw out the main army of Angband, after which Fingon's host would\nattack from the Ered Wethrin and crush the armies of Morgoth between the\ntwo forces. They would then seal the doors of Angband and, hopefully,\ndrive Morgoth underground forever. The Union first cleared Beleriand and\nDorthonion from the Orcs, and then gathered to assault Angband. However,\nthese attacks alerted Morgoth to the existence of the Union, and he took\ncounsel against it. Morgoth learned of the battle plan of the Eldar from\nhis spies, and sought to prevent Maedhros's forces from meeting with\nFingon's. To that end, he sent a gigantic force of his own, one which\nincluded Glaurung and his numerous fire-breathing brood, to destroy\nMaedhros's host. Fingon's troops eventually settled in the woods of Ered\nWethrin to await the coming of Maedhros's forces, not knowing that they\nhad been attacked. Upon the arrival of Fingon's forces to Ered Wethrin,\nsmoke and fire poured forth from Thangorodrim and the Iron Mountains.\nFingon thus knew that Morgoth had become aware of his forces, and doubt\nbegan to grow on him. Just at that moment however, Turgon arrived\nunexpectedly with an army ten thousand strong from Gondolin, and hope\nwas renewed in the heart of the Elven host. Aware of both the location\nof Fingon's troops and the strategy the elves hoped to employ, Morgoth\nsent a great force of Orcs from Angband to meet Fingon's host. In\nactuality, this force was but a small portion of the armies Morgoth had\nprepared, and was ultimately little more than bait. For Morgoth intended\nfor this decoying force to draw out Fingon's army, and then to\nstrengthen it when Fingon came from the hills to meet it. But Fingon,\nwary of the guile of Morgoth, ignored the taunts of the Orcs and kept\nhis forces hidden. Seeing this, the captain of the Orcish host sent out\nriders with tokens of parley. With them was Gelmir, Gwindor's brother of\nNargothrond, whom the Orcs had blinded. To provoke the Elvish host, they\ndismembered Gelmir within sight of the Ered Wethrin and then killed him,\nthreatening to do the same with their other Elvish thralls.\nUnfortunately, Gwindor himself was in the forefront of the Elvish host,\nand he witnessed the cruel murder of his brother. Insane with grief and\nrage, he broke ranks and charged the heralds with the company from\nNargothrond and slew them, driving deep into the center of the Orcish\nhost. Seeing that his troops could not be restrained, Fingon sounded the\ncharge, and committed his entire force to the battle. Here, Morgoth's\ndesigns nearly went astray, for the onset of the Noldor charge was so\nswift and terrible that the Orcish host was destroyed before it could be\nstrengthened. At the forefront of the battle were Gwindor and his\ncompany, and their wrath was so great that they burst through Morgoth's\nouter gates and slew the guard in the very courts of Angband. It was\nsaid that Morgoth trembled as Gwindor's company pounded upon his gates,\nbut surrounded by a sea of enemies they became trapped in the court, and\nall were slain except Gwindor who was taken, for Fingon could not come\nto their aid. Then, from many hidden doors in Thangorodrim, Morgoth let\nforth his main host. Fingon's army was driven back from the walls of\nAngband with great loss. The Men of Brethil that comprised the rearguard\nwere nearly all slain, along with Haldir, Lord of the Haladin. The\nfourth day of the conflict was the official beginning of Nírnaeth\nArnoediad, and Fingon's forces continued to retreat with their\ncasualties mounting. At the start of the fifth day however, Fingon's\nforces were joined by Turgon, who had withheld most of his troops from\nthe foolhardy assault. The phalanx of Turgon broke through the lines of\nthe Enemy, and met with the guard of Fingon, along with Húrin son of\nGaldor. With Turgon's help, Fingon's forces managed to beat back the\nhost of Angband enough to begin an orderly retreat. However, the fortune\nof the Eldar then took another turn for the worse. For while Fingon's\narmies had been fighting Morgoth's forces on the plains of Anfauglith,\nMaedhros had been defeated by the armies that Morgoth had sent against\nhis host. To make matters worse, Maedhros had been betrayed by Ulfang,\none of the sons of Uldor, who had summoned a great force of evil men\nfrom the surrounding hills to attack the elven host. Reeling from the\nunexpected treachery and the continual assault of Morgoth's dragons, the\neastern host would have been utterly destroyed if not for the valor of\nthe Dwarves of Belegost. For they were naturally able to withstand the\ndragons' fire better than Elves or Men, and moreover they wore great\niron masks that gave them additional protection. These dwarves formed\nthe rearguard of the eastern host, and allowed the remaining Elves and\nMen to escape the dragons. Azaghâl, King of the Dwarves of Belegost,\ngathered his forces and formed a ring around Glaurung to keep him at\nbay. Such was their strength and the keenness of their axes that even\nGlaurung's armored hide was not invulnerable to their blows. Enraged,\nGlaurung struck down Azaghâl and crawled over him, but with his last\nstrength Azaghâl ran a dagger through Glaurung's belly, and the dragon\nfled in pain. With him fled all the beasts of Morgoth. In a solemn\nceremony the Dwarves picked up their fallen leader, forgetting about the\nbattle, and they marched his corpse home. Their wrath was so great that\nnone troubled them. Their sacrifice allowed all seven of the Sons of\nFëanor to escape, though their host was routed and scattered throughout\nOssiriand. After defeating Maedhros, Morgoth's eastern host had made\nhaste to to join the battle against Fingon's forces, and arrived as the\nelven forces had begun to withdraw. As they engaged the retreating\nElves, Gothmog himself arrived on the field with his Troll guard and\nengaged Fingon in single combat. The High Elven King managed to hold his\nown against the High Captain of Angband until another Balrog restrained\nFingon from behind. Gothmog then clove Fingon's head with his Black Axe,\nand the field of battle was soon utterly lost. Seeing this, Húrin begged\nTurgon to return to Gondolin, and told the King that he and his men\nwould cover the Elven retreat. Huor, Húrin and the remaining Men of\nDor-lómin then formed a living wall across the Fens of Serech, buying\ntime for Turgon to escape with most of the surviving Elves of the north.\nThe warriors of Dor-lómin were all slain, and Huor fell with his eye\npierced by a poisoned arrow. Finally Húrin was left to fight alone,\nwielding the great axe of an Orc captain two handed. He managed to slay\nseventy of his foes, including a great number of Gothmog's troll guard,\nfalling at last after his axe withered away from the caustic troll blood\nupon it. Gothmog then pulled Hurin out from under the mountain Orcs and\nTrolls that he slew, bound him, and dragged him to Angband with mockery.\nAftermath After Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the ability of Elves and Men to make\nwar against Morgoth was broken. Morgoth's victory was essentially\ncomplete, as he had destroyed all the people of Hithlum and had\nscattered the sons of Fëanor away from Himring. Morgoth's orcs razed all\nof Beleriand except for Doriath, which was still protected by the Girdle\nof Melian, and sacked the havens of the Falas. Nargothrond was also\nstill free, but Morgoth gave little thought to either it or Doriath,\nknowing that the two remaining Elven kingdoms were no threat to him.\nMorgoth betrayed his servants the Easterlings and trapped them in\nHithlum under penalty of death, denying them the fertile lands of\nBeleriand. Still Morgoth knew fear, for Turgon, now High King of the\nÑoldor after the death of Fingon in the battle, had survived, and his\ncity of Gondolin was still unknown to Morgoth. Hoping to discover the\nwhereabouts of Turgon, Morgoth summoned Hurin to him, seeking from him\nthe location of Gondolin. But Hurin mocked Morgoth and refused to betray\nTurgon. Morgoth then laid a terrible curse upon him and his kin, and\nbound Hurin to a chair upon Thangoridrim to witness the curse unfold. An\nalternate version A first and older version of the story was drawn by\nChristopher Tolkien primarily from a text called the _Grey Annals_,\nalthough the Quenta Silmarillion was used as well. But in the writing of\nthe long Narn i Chîn Húrin, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote a new version of the\nbattle which postdates both the GA and QS accounts. Christopher Tolkien\ndid not incorporate the major changes of the new version into the\nSilmarillion text, although he did take some phrasing and description\nfrom it. In the earlier version of the battle, Morgoth sent no armies\nagainst the forces of Maedhros, and instead Uldor delayed Maedhros's\nhost with a treacherous warning of a false assault from Angband.\nMaedhors eventually realized what he believed to be a mistake on Uldor's\npart, and his host at last arrived to aid Fingon in the fifth day as\nTurgon's forces did. Maedhros's forces assailed the armies of Angband in\nthe rear, and Morgoth was forced to release his reserves, including his\nBalrogs, Glaurung and his brood, and Gothmog the Lord of Balrogs. It was\nsaid in this version that the Elves might still have won, but Ulfang and\nhis Easterlings betrayed Maedhros, and summoned a great strength of evil\nMen from the surrounding hills, routing the host of Maedhros. The major\ndifference was that Morgoth defeats the Elves much more handily in the\nnewer version than he did in the old one. The entire element of the\n“Machinations of Uldor” delaying Maedhros's march is removed, and\nMorgoth sends a second force to meet Maedhros and prevent him from\njoining with the other elf lords. This version also lacks the nearly\nexplicit statement that the Elves could have won had it not been for the\ntreachery of men. Christopher Tolkien did not venture a guess on why his\nfather made these changes, but it may be that he felt the Elves did much\nbetter against Morgoth than they reasonably should have (especially\ngiven the extreme length and difficulty of the later War of Wrath). This\nis all speculation, however. It was explicitly stated several times both\nby in-universe characters and Tolkien in the Silmarillion that the Elves\nhad absolutely no chance of defeating Morgoth unaided, so it is possible\nthat the changes were made to concur with this line of thinking.\nEtymology _NÍRNAETH ARNOEDIAD_ was Sindarin for 'Tears Unnumbered'.",

History\nOrigins After the Valar entered the world and brought order to the seas\nand the lands and the mountains, and subdued the fires of Melkor, there\nwas a need for light. Aulë at the prayer of Yavanna forged two mighty\nlamps, Illuin and Ormal. Varda filled the lamps with light and Manwë\nhallowed them, and the Valar set them up on high pillars, Illuin in the\nfurthest north upon the pillar of Helcar, Ormal in the deepest south\nupon the pillar of Ringol. In the middle of Arda, where the light of the\nlamps mingled, amid the Great Lake lay the Isle of Almaren, where the\nValar dwelt. Destruction The pillars were cast down and their lamps\nbroken by Melkor. Lands were broken, seas arose in tumult, and\ndestroying flame from the broken lamps poured out over the Earth,\nmarring it, causing the Valar to flee Middle-earth for the Land of Aman,\nwhere they established the domain of Valinor. Where Illuin fell, the Sea\nof Helcar was formed, of which Cuiviénen was a bay. Other Versions of\nthe Legendarium In Tolkien's older writings (not used in the published\nversion of _The Silmarillion_), the Valar sought peace with Melkor,\nasking his assistance with fixing the lamps upon Arda. Melkor, still\nenvious and hateful of the rest of the Valar, agreed to give them a\nstrong, sturdy substance. He gave Aulë ice. Melkor permitted the Valar\nto do as they wished until the fateful day when the Lamps' light and\nheat finally melted the ice. The pillars crashed upon Arda, flooding it\nwith water and darkness."

    "text": "SIRION was a river in Middle-earth during the First Age, the principal\nriver of Beleriand. During most of its course, it was the border between\nEast and West Beleriand. Source The Sirion's source was at Eithel Sirion\non the eastern side of the Ered Wethrin, which lay in between Ard-galen\n(later Anfauglith) and Mithrim and Hithlum. It was guarded by the tower\nof Barad Eithel. Sirion flowed southwards along the border of the Ered\nWethrin, passing through the Fen of Serech before entering the narrow\nsteep-sided valley between the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath named the\nPASS OF SIRION. Sirion then continued south into Beleriand, with the\nForest of Brethil to the west, and Dimbar and then Doriath to the east.\nAfter leaving Doriath at Aelin-uial (the Fens of Sirion), it plunged\nbelow ground in the Falls of Sirion at Andram, where the ground fell\nsteeply. Three leagues southwards, the Sirion exited the underground\ncaves at the Gates of Sirion. It then flowed further south through\nNAN-TATHREN until it reached the Bay of Balar, part of Belegaer, at the\nMouths of Sirion. It total length was about three hundred and ninety\nmiles. In order from north to south, the principal tributaries of the\nSirion were the Rivil, flowing from Dorthonion until it met Sirion in\nthe Fen of Serech; the Mindeb, which had its source in Nan Dungortheb\nand the Ered Gorgoroth, the Teiglin, the Esgalduin of Doriath; the Aros\nflowing south from Dorthonion (and also containing the waters of the\nCelon from Himring and Himlad) which met at Aelin-uial, and the Narog,\nwhich joined Sirion in Nan-Tathren. The main crossing points mentioned\nin the Silmarillion were Brithiach where the road from Himlad, which\ncrossed the Esgalduin at Iant Iaur, crossed Sirion, and the Ferries of\nDoriath. The most important island in Sirion was Tol Sirion. The\noriginal Minas Tirith was built here by Finrod Felagund in the strategic\nlocation controlling the Pass of Sirion where it entered Beleriand\nbetween the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath. Shortly after Dagor\nBragollach, Sauron captured it and the island became known as\nTol-in-Gaurhoth. History Barad Eithel, at the source of the Sirion in\nthe Ered Wethrin, was a chief fortress of Fingolfin and his son Fingon,\nprobably guarding a pass into their realm of Mithrim. Further south, in\nthe Pass of Sirion, lay Tol Sirion. After the Coming of Men, the Edain\nof the House of Haleth made their home in the Forest of Brethil, and the\nSindar ruled by Thingol lay secure within the Girdle of Melian in their\nrealm of Doriath. At the outflow of Sirion into Belegaer, after the\ndestruction of Eglarest and Brithombar, the Havens of Sirion were built\nby Círdan and his people."

    "page_id": "2422",
    "text": "CUIVIÉNEN (Quenya IPA: ) was the location where the Quendi or the Elves\nawoke. Description Cuiviénen was said to have been on the shore of a\nlarge gulf in the inland Sea of Helcar in the far east of Middle-earth.\nIt was an eastern bay of the Inland Sea of Helcar, formed by the\nmeltwaters of the pillar of Illuin. After the First Age and the War of\nWrath, the Sea of Helcar (and Cuiviénen with it) was drained, leaving\nbehind only the Sea of Núrnen and the Sea of Rhûn, prompting the Elvish\nadage “and to Cuiviénen there is no returning”; both a reference to\nphysical geography and a metaphor for the Sundering. While never\nconfirmed, there is a small chance that it survives in a much truncated\nform. History In YT 1050, the Awakening of the Elves took place. The\nElves dwelt here for a long time in bliss under the starlight and were\ncontent. Here the elves were divided into their three basic groups: the\nMinyar (Vanyar), Tatyar (Ñoldor), and Nelyar (Teleri), here they learned\nand developed the basic skills of survival, culture, and language.\nUnfortunately, Melkor discovered this land first before the other Valar.\nMany elves feared him and they were forced to hide, and those\nunfortunate enough to be left behind or overwhelmed by fear and\nunhappiness were taken or slain. Then, years later, Oromë discovered\nCuiviénen on his travels throughout Middle-earth. Oromé reported his\ndiscovery back to the Valar in Valinor and after some debate they\ndecided that the Elves would be safer living in The Undying Lands, in\nthe peace and protection of the Valar. Oromé returned to Cuiviénen and\nthere spoke with the Elves regarding their removal to Valinor. The first\nSundering of the Elves then took place when the Eldar, name that was\ngiven by Oromé to the Elves using their own tongue, departed from\nCuiviénen to Valinor. Some of these Elves refused to leave through fear\nof the unknown, turned back after reaching the huge range of The Misty\nMountains, or simply decided to stay in Arda through choice. It is\nunknown how long the remaining Avari remained at Cuiviénen during the\nFirst Age, but they were there when Men awoke at the first rising of the\nSun in the nearby land of Hildórien, and its elven residents befriended\nearly Men and apparently taught them the basic skills of survival. Other\nmentions In his attempt to sway the Ñoldor to join him in pursuit of\nMelkor to Middle-earth, Fëanor spoke of the “sweet waters” of Cuiviénen\nthat they had left in vain to travel to Aman. Etymology CUIVIÉNEN is a\nQuenya word that means “Water of Awakening” from _cuivié_ (“awakening”)\nand _nen_ (“water”).",

History The\nbattle was fought as result of a massive Orc buildup beneath the Ered\nWethrin and in the Pass of Sirion.

Prelude When Fëanor intended to leave Valinor,\nhe needed ships to get to Middle-earth without great loss, but the\nÑoldor possessed no ships, and Fëanor feared that any delay in their\ndeparture would cause the Ñoldor to reconsider. The Ñoldor, led by\nFëanor and his sons, tried to persuade their friends, the Teleri of\nAlqualondë, to give him their ships. However, the Teleri would not help\nin any way against the will of the Valar, and in fact attempted to\npersuade their friends to reconsider and stay in Aman. Unwilling to take\n“no” for an answer, the Ñoldor started taking the ships and sailing them\naway. This angered the Teleri, and they threatened the Ñoldor with rocks\nand arrows, and they threw many of Fëanor's followers out of the ships\nand into the harbor. They also began to attempt to block the harbour;\nhowever, it is only slightly possible that the Teleri drew first blood.\nThe Battle Then the Ñoldor drew swords, and the Teleri their bows, and\nthere was a bitter fight that seemed evenly matched, if not even in\nfavor of the Teleri, until the second Host of the Ñoldor, led by Fingon,\narrived together with some of Fingolfin's people. Misunderstanding the\nsituation, they assumed the Teleri had attacked the Ñoldor under orders\nof the Valar, and they joined the fight. Consequences In the end many\nTeleri were slain and the ships taken and many of the stolen ships were\nwrecked in the waves. All that continued towards Middle-earth were\ntherefore cursed by Mandos. The act also had repercussions in\nMiddle-earth, when the Sindar, especially those of Doriath, found out\nabout it, costing the Ñoldor the support of the Sindar in their war\nagainst Morgoth; the Sindar King Thingol barred those of the House of\nFëanor, or any others that took place in the Kinslaying, from entering\nhis kingdom.

He sang songs and laughed with the Hobbits; they stayed\nat his ent-house near Derndingle, where the Entmoot was held. Bregalad\nlater played an important role in the attack on Isengard, as he fought\nalong side with Treebeard, and he nearly captured Saruman himself. After\nthe water from Isen River had flooded Isengard, he stood guard at the\nbottom of the stairs of Orthanc. After the War of the Ring, his furthur\nfate is unknown, but he possibly died in Fourth Age.",

History Tol Eressëa was originally an\nisland that stood in the middle of the Belegaer far from either the\ncoasts of Aman or Middle-earth. Ulmo uprooted it and with the help of\nhis servants used it as a ferry to transport the willing three kindreds\nof the Elves back and forth twice from Middle-earth to Aman. After that,\nthe host of Olwë remembering the star-light of their home in eastern\nMiddle-earth begged to the Maia Ossë to stay their journey. Their\nrequest was granted at the behest of Ulmo. Ossë rooted it permanently to\nthe bottom of the sea, and never moved again afterwards. The isle came\nto rest forever just off the eastern shore of Aman in the Bay of\nEldamar, and the Teleri dwelt there ever after. This long separation\nfrom the Vanyar and the Ñoldor caused the Telerin language to sunder\nfrom Quenya of the other Calaquendi. So that the Teleri could see the\nlight of Valinor, the Valar opened a cleft in the Pelori so that the\nlight of the Two Trees shone upon it, making its western shores green\nand fertile. Many Teleri lived here until their lord Olwë built the city\nAlqualondë on the northwestern shore of Aman. With the end of the First\nAge, many of the Eldar of Middle-earth exiles came to it, and lived on\nthe island of Tol Eressëa. Sometime during the early Second Age, the\nElves that chose to settle there built Avallonë in the eastern part of\nthe island. It was also where most of the elves visiting Númenór came\nfrom at least until the shadow fell upon the Númenóreans. The\nNúmenóreans yearning for the light of the east would often gaze at the\ngreat tower of Avallonë, which they could see from the westernmost parts\nof their homeland. When Ar-Pharazôn the Golden broke the Ban of the\nValar and sailed to the Undying Lands with his Great Armament, Tol\nEressëa was surrounded by its fleets before going to Tirion, but it is\nnot known whether its people were assailed by this act or not. Earlier\nversions of the legendarium In early versions of Tolkien's legendarium,\nthe island was later visited by Ælfwine (or Eriol), an Englishman from\nthe Middle Ages, which provided a framework for the tales that later\nbecame _The Silmarillion_. Over time it had become a land of many\nbeautiful places and interesting sites such as: Alalminórë, the Land of\nElms, and Tavrobel. Along with Ulmo, his great whale Uin was also in\ncharge to carry the island to the Bay of Eldamar. The Cottage of Lost\nPlay, which Eriol visited, was one of the more famous spots in Tol\nEressëa at which many stories were told (the stories that became the\n_Lost Tales_) of ancient times. At different eras of development of his\nmythology Tolkien either saw Tol Eressëa as the island of Britain, or as\nthe island of Avallon, off the coast of Britain beyond the Straight Path\nnear Valinor In some of the later writings and letters he began to see\nthe Shire and Rivendell to be closer to England geographically. Some of\nthe ideas of Avalon (and Arthurian legend) that had been associated with\nthe island can also be seen in the name of the city Avallonë. Tolkien\neven echoed this in a letter when he stated he had given Frodo and Bilbo\nan “Arthurian ending”. But when Morgoth was thrust forth, the Gods held\ncouncil. The Elves were summoned to return into the West, and such as\nobeyed dwelt again in Eressëa, the Lonely Island, which was renamed\nAvallon: for it is hard by Valinor.

Thus, the seas suffered from wanton storms\nwhich came unto the lands, bringing great ruin to them. He was persuaded\nto stop by Uinen under Aulë's bidding, but his taste for violence never\nreally disappeared. The other Valar still loved him but did not\ncompletely trust him. Ossë also obstructed the work by Ulmo and Uin the\ngreat whale by dragging back the island of Tol Eressëa westward, which\nUin (or with Ulmo and possibly other animals as well) carried to Aman.\nDuring the process, the portion of the original island fallen off\nsettled and later became the Isle of Balar.

Tolkien's later languages, was based on the Germanic languages,\nand has a lot in common with the Gothic language, which the young\nTolkien was interested in. The grammar and syntax of Taliska is known to\nexist in a mostly complete form, but despite work by Tolkienists this\nhas not yet been published. es:Taliska it:Taliska ru:Талиска"

History The Battle of\nAzanulbizar was fought in the year TA 2799 at the eastern gate of Moria\nbetween the Dwarves of all houses and the Orcs of the Misty Mountains.\nIt was the greatest battle of the War of Dwarves and Orcs, and was a\ndecisive victory for the Dwarves. However, the battle claimed the lives\nof many, including Frerin, the second son of Thráin II, and the younger\nbrother of Thorin Oakenshield. Fundin, father of Balin and Dwalin, also\nfell. Náin, son of Grór was slain in a fight with Azog, right outside\nthe East Gate. Azog was then slain in turn by Náin's son Dáin Ironfoot.\nAfter the Orcs were routed, Thráin II, heir of Durin, wished to enter\nand reclaim Moria after the War. However, the Dwarves of Durin's folk\nwere too few, and the Dwarves of the other six houses believed that they\ndid not have the strength to confront Durin's Bane, though none knew\nwhat it was. The aftermath of the battle and the overall war resulted in\ndevastating losses for all the dwarves involved, but virtually all of\nthe Orcs infesting the Misty Mountains were destroyed, leaving only a\nhandful left. This resulted in the Misty Mountains being relatively\nsafer for the next two centuries. The Battle of Azanulbizar was also\nwhere Thorin earned the name “Oakenshield”; after his shield was broken\nduring the battle, he cleaved a great branch from a nearby oak tree to\nuse as both a shield and a bludgeon. The Dwarves' losses were so great\nthat it was impossible to bury all their dead, and instead the corpses\nwere burned on funeral pyres. In later years, the relatives and\ndescendants of these casualties would commonly say of their ancestor,\n_“He was a burned Dwarf”_, a remark instantly understandable as a\nreference to Azanulbizar and the Dwarves who died there.",

Biography Beleg “followed no man”, and\n“could not be restrained”. Beleg and his friend Mablung were the only\nElves of Doriath to fight with the Union of Maedhros in the Nirnaeth\nArnoediad, as King Thingol would have nothing to do with the war.\nTogether with Mablung he was one of the great captains of the Sindar,\nand he was part of the Hunting of the Great Wolf Carcharoth during the\ntrials of Beren and Lúthien.

When Túrin left Doriath, Beleg got\npermission from Thingol to follow him into exile and bring him the kings\npardon, wielding the black sword Anglachel that Eöl had forged and given\nto Thingol in tribute. Beleg found the band of outlaws Turin was leading\nwhile Turin was away scouting, and was tortured by the outlaws until\nTurin found and released him. Unable to persuade Turin to return to\nDoriath with him, Beleg returned to King Thingol and gained permission\nto join Turin. He went into the wilds again and found Turin on Amon\nRûdh.

He met the escaped thrall Gwindor in\nTaur-nu-Fuin and together they rescued Túrin, but as Beleg cut the bonds\nfrom Túrin's wrists and ankles he slipped, accidentally cutting Túrin\nwith his sword. Túrin awoke and did not recognize Beleg in the darkness,\nassuming the shape bent over him with a blade was an orc and that he was\nto be tortured again. In a sudden rage of self-defense, he wrested the\nsword from Beleg and killed him. After his death Túrin made the song\n_Laer Cú Beleg_, _The Song of the Great Bow_, and was known to sing it\nat times of grief and pain, in honor of his fallen friend and comrade.\nEtymology In Sindarin, _BELEG_ means “mighty”.

    "text": "ÉORED is the name of a cavalry company of riders of the Rohirrim. It\nconsisted of one-hundred and twenty mounted warriors, and a full muster\nof the Éoreds of Rohan was called an Éoherë. In the War of the Ring,\nÉomer commanded one of several Éored involved in the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields. Description An Éored was a group of well-trained\nwarriors who rode as a combat unit. Under the military reorganization in\nthe time of King Folcwine, the size of a full Éored was determined to be\nat least 120 men. One Éored was one hundredth of the Éoherë - the full\nmuster of Rohan. The Riders of an Éored could serve for a term or on a\npermanent basis. Each Éored was led by a captain. In times of war or\nunrest, the Marshals of the Mark each had a battle-ready Éored as part\nof his household which he could command at his discretion. History\nDuring the first three hundred years of Rohan's existence, the term was\nused widely to describe any significant number of Riders. Under King\nFolcwine, the military of Rohan was reordered. Under Folcwine, one Éored\nwas made up of 120 riders including their captain. Each Éored was also\nsupposed to comprise one-hundredth of the whole Muster of Rohan, not\nincluding the household of the King. War of the Ring The changes made by\nFolcwine continued through the time of the War of the Ring. While the\nforce commanded by Théoden King son of Thengel at the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields did not number much more than half of 12,000 riders, it\nwas possibly the largest riding of the Rohirrim in history. During the\nWar of the Ring, Éomer, the Third Marshal of the Mark, defied orders and\nled his Éored in pursuit of a band of orcs who had entered Rohan from\nthe Emyn Muil. In the battle between Éomer's men and the orcs, fifteen\nRiders were killed. Éomer's Éored thus numbered only 105 when they\nencountered Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli on February 30, 3019. Merry\nBrandybuck and Éowyn, disguised as a Rider named Dernhelm, rode with the\nÉored commanded by Elfhelm to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields on March\n15. When the Rohirrim charged onto the battlefield, Éomer led the first\nÉored in the center while Elfhelm's Éored was on the right flank and\nGrimbold's was on the left flank and the other companies followed\nbehind. King Theoden rode before them all. After the War of the Ring,\nÉomer returned to Minas Tirith with an Éored of Rohan's fairest knights\nto escort the body of their slain King home for burial. Etymology In Old\nEnglish, the word ÉORED means “Cavalry, band, or troop”. It may have\nalso been dervied from _eoh_ (“horse”) and _rád_ (“riding”)."

As such, there were usually three Marshals. History The\nfirst Marshal's charge was the King's lands. These included Folde and\nHarrowdale, and the muster also of Edoras, the capital. The second\nMarshal was usually charged with the West-Mark, including the Fords of\nIsen, a pivotal location in Rohan's defense during the War of the Ring.\nThe Hornburg (Helm's Deep) was the base of the West-Mark's Marshal. The\nEast-Mark often went to the third Marshal. His headquarters were at\nAldburg, once the home of Eorl the Young, first King of the Mark. The\nsecond and third Marshals, however, were interchangeable, and were\nassigned based on need by the King. At the time of the War of the Ring,\nThéoden King son of Thengel still held loosely the title of first\nMarshal. During his youth, he had enjoyed leading the Muster of Edoras,\nbut as he fell under the growing shadow of Saruman, and his servant\nWormtongue, Théoden began to neglect his charges and duties as a\nMarshal. The second Marshal and commander of the Westfold was Théodred,\nson and heir of Théoden. Éomer son of Éomund, nephew of the King, was\nthe third Marshal, and filled his father's post as commander of the\nEast-Mark. Due to Théoden's condition, the de facto commander at Edoras\nwas Elfhelm, who acted as a Marshal of the Mark. Háma, the loyal captain\nof the King's guard, was also at the capital. When war with Saruman\nbegan, Théodred assumed command of Rohan's army, despite the orders of\nhis father speaking through his wicked counsellor Gríma. Théodred\nordered a muster to Edoras and soon led a good portion of the King's\nriders west to strengthen the Fords of Isen against invasion. Later,\nÉomer defied the King and led his Éored (riders of his own household,\nhis personal guard) to remove the herdfolk of the East-Mark behind the\nfens of Entwash. There he encountered the Orcs returning to Isengard\nfrom the Falls of Rauros, and later Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. During\nthe battles of the Lord of the Rings, the renewed Théoden assumed\ncommand of the army. With Théodred slain, Éomer acted as first Marshal.\nElfhelm led the muster of Eastfold, while Grimbold, previously a captain\nand hero of the battles at the Fords of Isen, commanded the riders of\nWestfold. After the War of the Ring was ended, Éomer King reordered the\npositions of the Marshals. He himself commanded the Muster of Rohan, and\ncaused the position of first Marshal to be held ever by the King or, in\nthe case of age or sickness, the King's heir (assuming the King had at\nleast another clear claimant to the throne). The positions of second and\nthird Marshal were largely dissolved, replaced by the titles Marshal of\nthe East-Mark and of the West-Mark. de:Marschall der Riddermark\nru:Маршал Рохана"

However, other writings of Tolkien have more to say: In\nTolkien's _Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age_ we are told that\naside from Curunír (Saruman), Mithrandir (Gandalf), and Radagast, there\nwere “others of the Istari who went into the east of Middle-earth, and\ndo not come into these tales.” Tolkien also writes in _Unfinished Tales_\nthat the two Wizards were sent to the East.

He had a strong\nfriendship with the Elves, who were half his kin. Biography First Age In\nFA 532, Elros was born inArvernien. In the assault of the Third\nKinslaying by the Sons of Fëanor, Elros and Elrond were taken captive by\nMaglor and Maedhros. Later, Elwing, their mother, cast herself into the\ngreat Belegaer and vanished from Middle-earth. From then on, Elros and\nhis brother were raised by Maedhros and Maglor. They were both raised in\nlove for neither Maedhros nor Maglor were proud of their deeds. It is\nnowhere told when or if Elros and Elrond actually left Maedhros and\nMaglor but it can be assumed that at the time of Eönwë's arrival they\ntook full part in the war. In FA 547, the host of Eönwë and the Valar\nwere seen shining upon the sea and the noise of Eönwë`s trumpets rang\nover the waves.

The\nValar gave to Elrond and Elros the choice of which kindred they would\nbelong to. Elros chose to be of Man-kind and as such he was granted a\ngreat life-span. Eonwë came among the faithful humans and he taught them\nand gave them wisdom, power, and a life longer than any others of mortal\nrace, but none of the high men ever reached the age of Elros.

    "text": "THE QUEST OF EREBOR was an event that occurred prior to and had strong\nimpact on the War of the Ring at the end of Third Age. It explained why\nThorin and Gandalf have to retake the Lonely Mountain, and it is an\nadventure recounted from the perspective of Bilbo Baggins. History\nBackground Gandalf knew that Smaug could pose a serious threat if used\nby Sauron in war, then dwelling in Dol Guldur in Mirkwood. He was\nthinking about the matter when he met Thorin Oakenshield at Bree. Thorin\nalso was concerned about Smaug, but had the different motive of revenge\nand the reclaiming of the Dwarves' treasure in the Lonely Mountain.\nGandalf agreed to help Thorin. Gandalf thought Bilbo, an unlikely\nchoice, to be a suitable companion of Thorin and his Dwarves for a\nnumber of reasons. First, he had observed that Bilbo took an interest in\nthe world at large, and was thus adventurous. Another reason is that\nSmaug would not recognize the scent of a Hobbit, advantageous to a\nstealthy operation. Thorin also did not think highly of Hobbits, and\nputting Bilbo in the expedition might prevent the proud Thorin from rash\nactions — such as openly challenging Smaug. It was Thorin's objections\nto Bilbo that Gandalf found most difficult to overcome. Thorin believed\nthat Bilbo was incapable of helping their adventure and that Gandalf\nmight be simply meddling in his affairs for his own reasons. After much\ndebate, Gandalf convinced Thorin that Bilbo would be a worthy member. It\ncould be thought that Gandalf arranged this as he has foreseen the later\nevent and wanted to create another front to fight Sauron. The Quest The\nCompany started from the Shire to the Trollshaws. Three Stone-trolls,\nTom, William and Bert caught them. Luckily, they were saved by Gandalf,\nby slamming the ground that hid the Troll cave from the sunlight, thus\nturning them to stone. Then they passed the Hidden Valley and arrived in\nRivendell. They left Gandalf behind with the White Council and went to\nHigh Pass. After being saved by Gandalf again in Goblin-town, they were\nhunted by Bolg's wargs. They were saved by Gwaihir and the other Great\nEagles. After having a night in Beorn's house, they went to Mirkwood.\nThranduil caught them and locked them in the cells. While, Bilbo, who\nwas wearing the Ring, he saved the Company by Barrels. And they found\nBard who brought them to Lake-town. They tempted the Master of Laketown\nand they successfully reached the Lonely Mountain. The Quest in The Lord\nof the Rings “The Quest of Erebor” was originally written in the 1950s\nto be a part of _The Lord of the Rings_ but Tolkien decided not to\ninclude it, and only a very abridged version of the tale occurred in the\nAppendices. There are two manuscripts extant of the work. Both are\nwritten in the first person, from the perspective of Frodo Baggins.\nHowever, nearly all of the text consists of narration by Gandalf, who\nwas telling the story at the request of Frodo in Minas Tirith after the\ncoronation of King Aragorn II Elessar in _The Lord of the Rings_. Notes\n- The Quest caused Battle of Five Armies and indirectly caused the War\nof the Ring."

    "text": "The HIGH PASS, also named _CIRITH FORN EN ANDRATH,_ was an important\nmountain pass over the Misty Mountains. On its western end was the\nrefuge of Rivendell, and from there the Great East Road climbs into the\nmountains until it reaches the mountain under which lies the\nGoblin-town. History First Age The High Pass was first created before\nthe First Age by Oromë the Vala, in order to allow for a crossing of the\nmountains by the Eldar. Later in the First Age the High Pass was used by\nthe Dwarves, who connected their roads (the Great East Road and the\nMEN-I-NAUGRIM through Mirkwood) with it. It is worth noting that there\nare actually two passes at this location. The lower pass is more prone\nto being blocked by Orcs; hence, most travellers using the higher pass\noutside of those rare occasions when the Orcs were suppressed. Second\nAge In the later days of the Second Age, the High Pass was used by the\narmies of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men led by Gil-galad and\nElendil when they marched through it on their way to confront the armies\nof Sauron in Mordor. Third Age During the later Third Age the Pass\nbecame dangerous again because of the Orcs increasing in the mountains.\nOnly with the advent of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, which nearly\nwiped out all Orcs of the mountains, did the pass become safe again.\nAfterwards, the pass was considered to be safe for about one-hundred and\nforty years until about TA 2940, just before the Quest of Erebor when\nthe goblins of Goblin-town had delved an entrance to their underground\ntunnels on the pass. Thorin and Company were captured there in TA 2941\nwhen they intended to pass through the mountains on their way to the\nLonely Mountain. After the Battle of the Five Armies, the pass was once\nagain free from danger and was maintained by the Beornings and for many\nyears afterwards it had become important to trade between peoples living\nin Eriador and Rhovanion. During the War of the Ring, the Fellowship of\nthe Ring bypassed the High Pass because the eastern side of the Misty\nMountains had become too dangerous due to a winter snow storm. It was\nalso the most obvious route they could take from Rivendell."

    "title": "Awakening of the Elves",
    "page_id": "2631",
    "text": "The AWAKENING OF THE ELVES is an event which took place long before the\nbeginning of the First Age of Middle-earth. According to a legend of the\nElves, the first Elves were awakened by Eru Ilúvatar near the bay of\nCuiviénen. The first Elf to awake was called IMIN (“First”). Next to him\nlay IMINYË, who would become his wife. Near where Imin woke, awoke TATA\n(“Second”) and TATIË, and ENEL (“Third”) and ENELYË. Imin, Tata, and\nEnel and their wives joined up and walked through the forests. They\nfirst came across six pairs of Elves, and Imin, as eldest, claimed them\nas his people, and woke them. After a short time Imin and his people,\ntogether with Tata and Enel, continued their journey. Next, they came\nacross nine pairs of Elves, and Tata as second eldest, claimed them as\nhis people. After a short time the now thirty-six Elves continued their\njourney. Then they found twelve pairs of Elves, and Enel, as third\neldest, claimed them as his people. For many days the now sixty Elves\ndwelt by the rivers, and they began to invent poetry and music. Finally\nthey set out again, but Imin thought to himself that since each time\nthey had found more Elves and his folk was least in size, he would now\nchoose last. They came across eighteen pairs of Elves, who were watching\nthe stars, and Tata and Enel waited for Imin to claim them for his\npeople, but Imin told them he would wait, so Tata added them to his\nfolk. They were tall and had dark hair, and they were the fathers of\nmost of the Ñoldor of later times. The ninety-six Elves now spoke with\neach other and invented many new words, but then they continued their\njourney. Next they found twenty-four pairs of Elves, who were singing\nwithout language, and again Imin was offered the choice, but refused.\nTherefore Enel chose them as his people, and from them came most of the\nLindar or singers of later times. And the hundred and forty-four Elves\nnow dwelt long together, until all had learned the same language, and\nthey were glad. But then Imin said it was time to seek more companions\nfor him, but most of the others were content and did not join him. So\nImin and Iminyë and their twelve companions set out alone, and they\nsearched long near Cuiviénen, but never found any more companions. And\nbecause all Elves had been found in groups of twelve, twelve became the\nnumber they counted with ever after, and 144 was for long their highest\nnumber, and in none of their later tongues was there therefore any\ncommon name for a greater number. After the tale of the Awakening of the\nElves the _Companions of Imin_ or the Eldest Company (the later Vanyar)\nnumbered fourteen, and they remained the smallest company. The\n_Companions of Tata_ (half of whom became the Ñoldor) numbered\nfifty-six, and they remained the second-largest company. The _Companions\nof Enel_ (the later Lindar or Teleri) were the largest company,\nnumbering seventy-four. Melkor was the first to learn of the Awakening.\nHe soon began sending evil spirits among the Elves, who planted seeds of\ndoubt against the Valar. It is also rumoured that some of the Elves were\nbeing captured by a Rider if they strayed too far, and the Elves later\nbelieved these were brought to Utumno and twisted into Orcs. Oromë one\nday came across the Elves, and realized who they were. At first the\nElves were suspicious of him, fearing he was the Rider who captured the\nElves, and because of the lies of Melkor. Nevertheless, three lords of\nthe Elves agreed to come with Oromë to Valinor. These were Ingwë of the\n_Minyar_ (later _Vanyar_), Finwë of the _Tatyar_ (later _Ñoldor_), and\nElwë of the _Lindar_. In due time, Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë returned to\nCuivienen, and told the Elves of the glory of Valinor, and there befell\nthe Sundering of the Elves. All the Minyar and half of the Tatyar were\npersuaded, along with most of the Lindar, and followed Oromë into the\nwest on the Great Journey. These have been known ever since by the name\nEldar, or “Star-folk”, which Oromë gave to them in their own language.\nThe remainder of the Tatyar and Lindar remained suspicious, or simply\nrefused to depart from their own lands, and spread gradually throughout\nthe wide lands of Middle-earth. They were after known by the name Avari,\nmeaning 'the Unwilling', because they refused the summons, in Quenya,\nthe language of the Eldar that eventually reached Valinor.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe tale of Imin, Tata and Enel, known as _CUIVIENYARNA_, was a very\nlate writing by Tolkien, written as part of _Quendi and Eldar_. They\nreplaced Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë as the eldest Elves, who now merely\nbecame the first ambassadors and the Kings of the Elves in exile.\nit:Risveglio degli Elfi ru:Пробуждение эльфов"

Those Moriquendi\nwho originally started on the journey but did not finish it were named\nthe ÚMANYAR, which meant “Those not of Aman”. _Moriquendi_ is a term for\nElves of the Avari, Sindar, and Nandor, but in practice is only applied\nto the Avari.

The forest bordered by Dorthonion and was\nthe northwest border of the Kingdom of Doriath, and lay between the\nrivers Teiglin (west) and Sirion (east). It was a dense, sparsely\npopulated Beech forest. History Brethil was probably originally part of\nDoriath during most of the Years of the Trees. When the Girdle of Melian\nwas set after the First Battle, the Forest of Brethil was not included\nin it and was for the most part unsettled. However, King Thingol still\nheld lordship over it. When Men came into the Beleriand, King Thingol\ngave his permission for some of their peoples to settle there so long as\nthey defended it. It was to Brethil that the House of Haleth removed\nafter dwelling east of the river Gelion, settling mainly on the Hill of\nAmon Obel where upon stood Ephel Brandir, the main feature of the\nforest. They defended it from the Orcs until the late fifth century of\nthe First Age, when much of their number was lost including their Lord\nHandir in a raid by the enemy. Some Drúedain also dwelt there. The\nHaladin came to Brethil from the lands of Caranthir by way of Estolad.\nThey had endured much hardship upon their long journey, but began to\nrecover and multiply in the isolated forest. There they formed an\nalliance with Elu Thingol, King of Doriath. At need, Thingol sent Beleg\nCúthalion with great force of his Sindarin Elves west to fight alongside\nHalmir son of Haldan, Lord of the Haladin. The combined force destroyed\na legion of Orcs, and the realm had peace for a time. Later, many of the\nWoodmen of Brethil joined the muster of Húrin son of Galdor, close kin\nof their lord Haldir, son of Halmir, and took part in the Nirnaeth\nArnoediad. After the disastrous battle, the Haladin became even more\nreclusive. Many withdrew to Ephel Brandir, the home of their lord\nBrandir the Lame, upon Amon Obel. Years later, Túrin Turambar son of\nHúrin was brought to Ephel Brandir, and became the de facto lord of the\nHaladin. The tragedy of the Children of Hurin ensnared the Haladin, and\nthe forest was eventually attacked by Glaurung, father of Dragons. He\nburnt a path directly towards Ephel Brandir, but Túrin managed to slay\nhim at Cabed-en-Aras upon Teiglin with his mighty sword Gurthang.\nReturning towards Ephel Brandir, Túrin learned the truth about his wife\nNíniel, and he, Níniel and Brandir all perished. The final stroke of\ndoom for the Haladin in Brethil came when Húrin returned to Amon Obel\nand sparked a civil war, which destroyed the bloodline of the House of\nHaldad. Túrin Turambar came here after the destruction of Nargothrond\nand a visit to Dor-lómin to rest not long before his fight with\nGlaurung. The Forest was Túrin's burial place as well Nienor Níniel and\nMorwen, as well as the Haudh-en-Elleth, the mound of Finduilas. The\ngrave of Túrin and Morwen, survived the ruin of Beleriand after the\nFirst Age, and thus did a speck of the Forest of Brethil still exist as\nTol Morwen.

History\nAfter the Dark Door, the Paths went under the Dwimorberg, past another\ndoor where Aragorn and company found the remains of Baldor, son of the\nsecond King of Rohan, Brego. The Paths then continued past forgotten\ncities, emerging at the southern end of the White Mountains in Morthond\nvale, near the Stone of Erech. In the Second Age, a people related to\nthe Dunlendings had lived in the White Mountains, and they had for a\ntime served the Dark Lord Sauron.

    "page_id": "2652",
    "text": "The HISTORY OF ARDA is divided into three time periods, known as the\nYears of the Lamps, Years of the Trees and Years of the Sun. A separate,\noverlapping chronology divides the history into 'Ages of the Children of\nIlúvatar'. The first such Age began with the Awakening of the Elves\nduring the Years of the Trees and continued for the first six centuries\nof the Years of the Sun. All the subsequent Ages took place during the\nYears of the Sun. Most Middle-earth stories take place in the first\nthree Ages of the Children of Ilúvatar. Basic history Music of the Ainur\n_Main article: Ainulindalë_ The supreme deity is called Eru Ilúvatar. In\nthe beginning, Ilúvatar created spirits named the Ainur. Ilúvatar made\ndivine music with them. Melkor, Tolkien's equivalent of Satan, who was\nthen one of the Ainur, broke the harmony of the music, until Ilúvatar\nbegan a third theme which the Ainur could not comprehend since they were\nnot the source of it. The essence of their song symbolized the history\nof the whole universe and the Children of Ilúvatar who were to dwell in\nit - the Men and the Elves. Then Ilúvatar created Eä, the universe\nitself, and the Ainur formed within it Arda, the Earth, “globed within\nthe void”: the world together with the airs is set apart from _Kuma_,\nthe “void” without. The first 15 of the Ainur who descended to Arda, and\nthe most powerful ones, were called Valar, and the Ainur of lesser might\nwho followed were called Maiar. Years of the Lamps _Main article: Years\nof the Lamps_ The Years of the Lamps began shortly after the creation of\nArda by the Valar. After the Valar entered the world, there was a light\nveiling the ground. The Valar took this light and concentrated it into\ntwo large lamps, Iluin and Ormal. The Vala Aulë forged great towers, one\nin the furthest north, and another in the deepest south. The Valar lived\nin the middle, at the island of Almaren. The end of the Years of the\nLamps was marked by Melkor's destruction of the Two Lamps. Years of the\nTrees _Main article: Years of the Trees_ Shortly after the destruction\nof the Two Lamps, Yavanna made the Two Trees, named Telperion (the\nsilver tree) and Laurelin (the gold tree) in the land of Aman, where the\nValar now lived. The Trees illuminated Aman, leaving Middle-earth in\ndarkness, save the light of the stars. The Elves awoke in Cuiviénen, and\nwere soon approached by the Valar, but also by Melkor. This event marked\nthe beginning of the First Age. Many, though not all, of the Elves were\npersuaded to go on the Great Journey westwards towards Aman. Along the\njourney several groups of Elves tarried, notably the Nandor and the\nSindar. The three clans who arrived at Aman were the Vanyar, Ñoldor, and\nthe Teleri. The Valar had captured Melkor and placed him in chains in\nAman. After he appeared to repent and was released, Melkor sowed great\ndiscord among the elves, and stirred up rivalry between the Ñoldorin\nKing Finwë's two sons Fëanor and Fingolfin. Out of jealousy and hatred\nfor the Silmarils three gems crafted by Feänor that contained the light\nof the Two Trees Melkor stole them, killing Finwë, who was guarding the\njewels. Then, with the help of the creature Ungoliant, he destroyed the\nTwo Trees and escaped to Middle-earth. Bitter at the Valar's inactivity,\nFeänor and his house left to pursue Melkor, cursing him with the name\n'Morgoth'. A larger host, commanded by Fingolfin, followed him. They\nreached the Telerin port-city of Alqualondë, but their Lord forbade them\nto use the Telerin ships. Feänor decided to take them by force and thus\nthe first Kinslaying ensued and only by the strength in numbers were the\nTeleri overcome and their fair ships stolen. Feänor's host sailed on the\nvessels, and burned them when he arrived in Middle-earth. Left behind,\nFingolfin and his company crossed over to Middle-earth through the\nHelcaraxë (also known as the Grinding Ice) in the far north. Around the\nsame time, but separately, Galadriel and Celeborn set sail for\nMiddle-earth without the permission of the Valar. Years of the Sun The\nYears of the Sun began when the Valar made the Sun and the Moon out of\nthe final fruit of Laurelin and the final flower of Telperion and set\nthem in the heavens. Thereafter, years were reckoned in Middle-earth as\nthey are in our own real world. The First Age of the Children of\nIlúvatar continued into this new reckoning of time. Ages of the Children\nof Ilúvatar First Age _Main article: First Age_ Feänor was soon lost in\nan attack on Morgoth's Balrog s - but his sons survived, and founded\nrealms the kingdoms of the House of Fingolfin. The Long Peace lasted\nhundreds of years; during which time Men arrived over the Blue\nMountains, but the peace was not to last; and one by one the kingdoms\neven the hidden ones of Gondolin and Doriath eventually fell. At the end\nof the age, all that remained of free Elves and Men in Beleriand was a\nsettlement at the mouth of the River Sirion and another settlement on\nthe isle of Balar. Eärendil had possession of a Silmaril, which his wife\nElwing's ancestors Beren and Lúthien had taken from Morgoth, but the\nFeänorians had a claim on the Silmaril still and so there was another\nKinslaying. Eärendil and Elwing took the Silmaril across the Great Sea,\nto beg the Valar for aid. They responded. Melkor was exiled into the\nVoid; and most of his works were destroyed. This came at a terrible\ncost, as Beleriand itself was sunk. Second Age _Main article: Second\nAge_ The men who had remained faithful were given the island of Númenor,\nin the middle of the Great Sea whilst the Elves were allowed to return\nhome. The Númenóreans became great seafarers, but were jealous of the\nelves for their immortality. Meanwhile, in Middle-earth it became\napparent that Sauron, Morgoth's chief servant, was still active. He\nworked with Elven smiths in Eregion on the craft of rings, and forged\nthe One Ring to dominate them all. The Elves noticed this and removed\ntheirs. Towards the end of the age, the Númenóreans were growing\nincreasingly proud. King Ar-Pharazôn humbled even Sauron and brought him\nto Númenor as a hostage. Sauron worked his way into Pharazôn's court,\nand became high priest in a cult of Morgoth. Eventually, Pharazôn was\npersuaded to attempt to invade Aman, promised that immortality would\nresult. Amandil, chief of the Faithful, sailed westward to warn the\nValar of this. His son Elendil and grandsons Isildur and Anárion\nprepared to flee eastwards. When the King's men had landed on Aman, the\nValar lay down their guardianship of the world and called for Ilúvatar\nto intervene. The world was changed into a sphere, and the straight road\nfrom Middle-earth to Aman was broken. Númenor was utterly destroyed, as\nwas the fair body of Sauron. Elendil and his sons founded the realms of\nGondor and Arnor. Sauron arose again and challenged them. The Elves\nallied with the Men to form the Last Alliance, which defeated him. His\ngreat One Ring was taken from him by Isildur but not destroyed. Third\nAge _Main article: Third Age_ The Third Age saw the rise in power of the\nrealms of Arnor and Gondor, and their fall. Arnor was divided into three\npetty Kingdoms, which fell one by one, whilst Gondor fell into the civil\nwar of the Kin-strife, plague, Wainriders, and the Corsairs of Umbar. By\nthe time of _The Lord of the Rings_, Sauron had recovered again, and was\nseeking the One Ring. He discovered that it was in the possession of a\nHobbit named Baggins, and sent out the Ringwraiths to find him and\nretrieve it. The Ring-bearer, Frodo Baggins, is sent to Rivendell, where\nit is decided that the One Ring must be destroyed once and for all and\nit can only be unmade in the fiery depths of Mount Doom where it was\nforged. He sets out on this quest with eight other companions who\ncomprise _The Fellowship of the Ring_. After a long and difficult\njourney, he and Sam Gamgee finally complete the mission, succeeding\nlargely due to an unforeseen event that was out of their control. Sauron\nis thus destroyed forever and they are lauded as heroes. Aragorn takes\nhis place as King of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor, at last\nrestoring the line of Kings from the Stewards of Gondor. Fourth Age and\nAfter _Main article: Fourth Age_ The end of the Third Age marked the end\nof the involvement of the Elves in Human affairs, despite a short-lived\nrevival of Elven presence in Gondor under Legolas. Most Elves who have\nlingered in Middle-earth leave for Valinor. Those who remain behind\n“fade” and eventually diminish; a similar fate occurs for the Dwarves.\nAlthough Lonely Mountain (Erebor) becomes an ally of the Reunited\nKingdom, there are indications Khazad-dûm is refounded, and a colony is\nestablished under Gimli in the White Mountains (Ered Nimrais). The\ndwarves become ever more reclusive and disappear from human history.\nMorgoth's creatures are almost wiped out and never recover. During the\nlater Fourth Age, as the heirs of the Númenóreans forget their heritage,\nthe tales of the earlier Ages become legends and are eventually\nconsidered fantasies. Since then, Tolkien wrote that the ages have\nquickened, and he estimated that the 20th century was in the Sixth or\nSeventh age. it:Storia di Arda ru:История Арды"

Leaving Fangorn\nforest, the river flowed past the Wold of Rohan, and then headed south,\ndividing Rohan into Westemnet and Eastemnet. At the latitude of Edoras\nit was joined by the river Snowbourn, and then flowed east towards\nAnduin, which it joined just south of the Falls of Rauros, in the huge\ninland delta known as the _Mouths of the Entwash_. The Mering Stream or\n_Glanhír_ met one of the Entwashes' arms there. The influence of water\nwas so great that at the other end of the Anduin the marshes of Nindalf\n(Wetwang) and the Dead Marshes arose.

    "text": "The BLUE MOUNTAINS or ERED LUIN, also known as ERED LINDON, was a\nmountain range situated in the far west of Eriador. History Early Arda\nThe Blue Mountains arose sometime after the tumultuous chaos caused by\nMelkor's destruction of the Two Lamps that destroyed the perfect\nsymmetry of Arda. In these early days, the Blue Mountains were located\nbetween the newly formed great sea of Belegaer and the newly formed Sea\nof Helcar. The Blue Mountains were connected to the Iron Mountains to\nthe north and the Red Mountains in the east which formed one great\nmountain range chain known by different names. The Ancient Grey\nMountains were to its south separated by a great gap. Eldar Days During\nthe Years of the Trees and the Sleep of Yavanna, the Blue Mountains was\nan unbroken line separating Eriador from Beleriand. Seven rivers arose\nin it on the western side, and the land these rivers flowed through was\nknown as Ossiriand, which was later also known as Lindon, therefore the\nmountains were sometimes referred to as the Ered Lindon. Dwarven kinfolk\neither awoke here or migrated here from other awakening points and\ndelved the cities of Belegost and Nogrod and made contact and alliance\nwith the Sindar of Thingol. Second Age The mountain range was broken\nduring the war of the Valar against Morgoth, and at the middle of the\nrange the sea broke through, creating a great gap where was set the Gulf\nof Lune a new terminus for the river Lune. In the middle of the gap,\nwhere the Lune met the sea, the Grey Havens of Mithlond of the Elven\nKingdom of Lindon were built. When seen as the border of Lindon the Ered\nLuin were called Ered Lindon. Third Age and beyond During the Third Age,\nits forests, besides that of Mirkwood, were the largest in Middle-earth.\nIn the latter part of the Third Age, the Dwarves settled the Blue\nMountains again when Thráin II and his son Thorin and the Dwarven\nsurvivors of the Sack of Erebor moved from Dunland and delved a\nprosperous settlement there. After the War of the Ring and the defeat of\nSauron, Elves continued to travel west to Lindon through the gap in the\nmountains by way of the Gulf of Lune, where they eventually intended to\nset sail on the Straight Road to the Undying Lands of Aman. After the\nWar of the Ring it is said that many Dwarves from the east migrated back\nto their ancient homeland and Ered Luin was a prosperous kingdom\noncemore. Inhabitants Dwarves The Blue Mountains, the Iron Hills, and\nLonely Mountain were the main areas of Dwarf colonization by the late\nThird Age. During the 4000+ years following the cataclysmic sundering\nand catastrophic downfall of Beleriand, when the mighty Dwarf\nfortress-cities of Nogrod and Belegost were inundated by the sea, it is\npossible that the Dwarves rebuilt those cities to their former splendor.\nThe Dwarves would have plundered the mines of the Blue Mountains for the\nhoard of resources it held within the depths of darkness at its roots. \nBefore setting off in their quest to the Lonely Mountain, Thorin\nOakenshield and his twelve other companions (as well as other Dwarves of\nthe Lonely Mountain) resided here in the Blue Mountains after being\nrendered homeless by the Dragon Smaug. After the War of the Ring, many\nDwarves from the eastern kingdoms migrated back to the Blue Mountains.\nTheir population grew and the Blue Mountains became a prosperous kingdom\nonce again. Elves It is shown in several maps made of Middle-earth that\nvast ancient forests flanked both sides of the Blue Mountains, even\nafter the gargantuan slaughter of Eriador's great forests by the men of\nNúmenor and their incessant appetite for lumber. These forests,\nalongside the fertile coastal plain, would prove to be hotspots for\nElven migration and inhabitation. It is stated at the very beginning of\n_The Hobbit_ that the High Elves lived within the vales and forests of\nthe Blue Mountains, presumably sharing the land with the Dwarves. To\nthis number would be added Sindar, Wood-elves, and maybe even a few\nAvari. The influx of new Elven settlers soared after the end of the\nFirst Age who lived under the Ñoldor High King Gil-galad in the Second\nAge. After the fall of Gil-galad in the Third Age, the foot of the Blue\nMountains became part of Lindon where Elves lived temporarily until they\nleft for the Undying Lands, due to the Elves desiring to escape the woes\nand predicaments of Middle-earth. Geology Although the Blue Mountains\nwere little described (owing to their location on the fringes of all of\nTolkien's tales), we can assume a bit of their geology. The outer layers\nof the mountains seem to have been underlaid by metamorphic rocks formed\nin contact with numerous igneous intrusions. This environment is often\nnecessary to produce veins of ore such as those mined by the Dwarves\nfrom the beginning of time. This environment produced the trove of Gold,\nSilver, Iron, Gems, and other materials that made the Dwarf kingdoms\nincredibly wealthy. The Blue mountains were shorter than the Misty\nMountains, and not as high; their altitude was probably around 3000-4000\nmeters, on average.

Description The Orocarni\nroughly followed the line of the _Red Mountains,_ which had been made by\nthe Valar before Arda was marred and the symmetry was lost in the wars\nagainst Melkor. On the western slopes of the Orocarni grew the _Wild\nWood_, near a great waterfall of a river that flowed into the Inland Sea\nof Helcar where the bay of Cuiviénen lay, where the Elves woke. At their\nnorthern edge the Orocarni connected with the Iron Mountains resembling\nthe Blue Mountains in the far west. One of the rivers that arose in the\nOrocarni flowed into the inland Sea of Rhûn. History Four of the seven\nFathers of the Dwarves awoke in the range in the Years of the Trees.\nAfter the end of the First Age, the Orocarni remained, and ran through\nthe center of the land of Rhûn. They were home to the Dwarven clans of\nthe Ironfists, Blacklocks, Stonefoots, and Stiffbeards. The Ironfists\nand Stiffbeards lived in the T-shaped northern half while the Blacklocks\nand Stonefoots lived in the backwards-C-shaped southern half. It is\n_not_ explained by Tolkien who lives in the far-north, center-north,\ncenter-south, or far-south quarters. However, the most probable theory\nis that the Stiffbeards lived in the far-northern Orocarni, the\nIronfists lived in the center-northern Orocarni, the Stonefoots lived in\nthe center-southern Orocarni, and the Blacklocks lived in the\nfar-southern Orocarni. During his travels in Middle-earth, Oromë stood\nunder the shadow of the Orocarni and from there he first heard the\nsinging of the Elves in Cuiviénen thus finding the Firstborn of Eru\nIlúvatar for the first time. Concerning Elven folk, the Dark Elves lived\nin the forests bordering these mountains, and likely had similar capital\ncities to the one of Lothlórien and the one of Mirkwood, and similar\narchitecture, as well. Because the Orocarni were far to the east, they\nwere not visited by the Eldar, and the Edain did not reach them until\nthe Fourth Age. The Orocarni do not appear in any of the tales of the\n_Red Book of Westmarch_.

    "title": "The Book of Lost Tales Part One",
    "page_id": "2672",
    "text": "_'_The Book of Lost Tales Part One _'_(sometimes here abbreviated _THE\nBOOK OF LOST TALES 1_) (ISBN 978-0345375216) is the title of the first\nvolume of Christopher Tolkien's 12-volume series _The History of\nMiddle-earth_, in which he analyses the unpublished manuscripts of his\nfather J. R. R. Tolkien. It was completed in 1983. ''The Book of Lost\nTales Part Two ''is its sequel and other half, which came a year later.\nPurpose Content _The Book of Lost Tales_ contains the first versions of\nthe stories which would later become _The Silmarillion_, and is notable\nbecause, while very primitive in style and content, it is very close to\nthe later work in many ways. Each of the Tales is followed by notes and\na detailed commentary by Christopher Tolkien. While many of the names in\nthe book are identical or close to those in the later versions, some of\nthem bear almost no resemblance to their final forms. J. R. R. Tolkien\nchanged names rather frequently, sometimes with several new variants\n(rejected in turn) written in a single manuscript. Confusingly,\nsometimes the name applied to one thing is later used to refer to a\ndifferent thing, the original use abandoned. As an example, the house of\nElves called “Teleri” in _The Book of Lost Tales_ is not the same as\nthat in _The Silmarillion_ (see Teleri). The original usage of “Teleri”\nwould eventually change until the name became “Vanyar”. Meanwhile, the\nhouse of Elves called “Solosimpi” would inherit the name “Teleri”. The\nframework for the book is that a mortal Man visits the Isle of Tol\nEressëa where the Elves live. In the earlier versions of the “Lost\nTales” this man is named Eriol, of some vague north European origin, but\nin later versions he becomes Ælfwine, an Englishman of the Middle-ages.\nThere are more changes visible within the book, and it is not internally\nconsistent, partially because even while still writing it Tolkien began\nrewriting earlier parts as his ideas about the world changed. The Tales\nwere eventually abandoned, but they were resurrected in part as the\n“Sketch of the Mythology” which would become _The Silmarillion_. For\npublication, the book was split into two volumes: _The Book of Lost\nTales Part One_ and _The Book of Lost Tales Part Two_, but this is\nsimply an editorial division. Both volumes are separated into several\n“Lost Tales”, as chapters. Table of Contents 1. “The Cottage of Lost\nPlay” — the “framework” story, recounting Eriol's arrival to the place\nwhere the following stories are told 2. “The Music of the Ainur” — the\nfirst version of what would become the Ainulindalë 3. “The Coming of the\nValar and the Building of Valinor” — later Valaquenta and the first\nchapters of Quenta Silmarillion 4. “The Chaining of Melko” 5. “The\nComing of the Elves and the Making of Kôr” 6. “The Theft of Melko and\nthe Darkening of Valinor” 7. “The Flight of the Noldoli” 8. “The Tale of\nthe Sun and Moon” 9. “The Hiding of Valinor” 10. “Gilfanon's Tale: The\nTravail of the Noldoli and the Coming of Mankind” (which contains the\nfirst and only reference to the enigmatic “wizard” fay, Tu) Comparison\nwith The Silmarillion The following is a direct comparison between the\ncontents of the early BOOK OF LOST TALES and the later sketches that\nbecame THE SILMARILLION. Although one of the _Lost Tales_ often\ncorresponds to more tales from _The Silmarillion_, still the narrative\nin the _Lost Tales_ is more extended (typically, 50% pages more). In J.\nR. R. Tolkien's notebooks, the 4th and 5th tales were a single one told\nby Meril-i-Turinqi, but Christopher Tolkien decided to separate them\nbecause of their length. The same applies to the 6th and 7th tales, told\nby Lindo.\n+-----------------------------+---------+-----------------------------+\n| The Book of Lost Tales | _Storyt | The Silmarillion | | | eller_ | |\n+=============================+=========+=============================+\n| | | |\n+-----------------------------+---------+-----------------------------+\n| Book I |\n+-----------------------------+---------+-----------------------------+\n| 1.

    "page_id": "2669",
    "text": "During Gandalf's fight with the Balrog in _The Lord of the Rings_, he\nsays of himself that he is the wielder of the Flame of Anor. It is\nnowhere else referred to in the trilogy, so its particular meaning\nremains unclear. _Anor_ is the Elvish word for the Sun, so literally the\n_flame of Anor_ would have alluded to the light of the Sun, which had\noriginated in the fiery fruit of Laurelin, one of the Two Trees of\nValinor. Thus, Gandalf may have meant the power he gained as a servant\n(a Maia) of the Lords of the West, in defiance to the corrupted darkness\nof the Balrog. Alternatively, Gandalf may have been referring to Narya,\nthe Ring of Fire, which he wore and wielded, but it seems unlikely that\nGandalf would want to reveal his ownership of a Ring of Power —a matter\nof utmost secrecy—to one of his greatest enemies. However, considering\nthat the Balrog owed no allegiance to Sauron at that time, Gandalf may\nhave been merely attempting to scare it away. In Tolkien's earliest\ndrafts, forms of this passage were variations on: “I am the master of\nWhite Flame. The Red Fire cannot come this way” (and one variation mixes\nin the idea of Black Shadow, too). These terms seem to be symbolic -\n_white_ for the powers of good, but _red_ or _black_ for Sauron and his\nservants. As the text developed, the _Red Fire_ and _Black Shadow_ were\nlost. The _White Flame_ remained, but developed into the more poetic\n_flame of Anor._ On this reading, then, the 'flame of Anor' doesn't\nrefer to a specific thing, but is Gandalf's way of announcing what he\nstands for, or perhaps his power as a servant of the Valar."

    "text": "The FATHERS OF THE DWARVES were the first seven of the founding fathers\nof the Dwarven race. History The Vala Aulë created the Dwarves because\nhe was impatient for the arising of the Children of Ilúvatar (Elves and\nMen). He created seven Dwarves, and was teaching them the language he\nhad devised for them. When Ilúvatar confronted him about what he had\ndone, Aulë offered his creations to Ilúvatar, who accepted them and gave\nthem life. However, the Fathers of the Dwarves had to wait until the\nElves first arrived, and Aulë laid them to rest in various places in the\ncontinent of Middle-earth. The eldest of all, Durin, “lay alone” at\nMount Gundabad in the north of the Misty Mountains. He later founded the\nline of the Longbeards (or _Sigin-tarâg_ in Khuzdul), the Dwarves which\nwere most friendly to the Elves and Men, mostly referred to as Durin's\nFolk. His city was Khazad-dûm. Two others were laid to rest near Mount\nDolmed in the Blue Mountains, and they founded the lines of the\nBroadbeams and the Firebeards who later lived in Nogrod and Belegost.\nThe other four Fathers of Dwarves were laid to rest in the far east, two\nof them at the northern end of the Orocarni, and the other two near the\nsouthern end of the range. These founded the lines of the _Ironfists_\nand _Stiffbeards_, and _Blacklocks_ and _Stonefoots_. No Dwarves of\nthese lines appear in the tales: however, as noted below, the Longbeards\nmay be formed out of Dwarves from all lines, and Dwarves from Durin's\nFolk may therefore have ancestors from these other lines. After the end\nof the First Age, when the ancestral homes of the Broadbeams and\nFirebeards were destroyed, these two lines merged with Durin's Folk, so\nthat Moria had a mixed population, and Thorin Oakenshield grew up in the\nremnants of the Firebeards' halls. Of the Fathers of the Dwarves, only\nDurin is said to have “lain alone”. This can be interpreted as referring\nto the fact he was indeed laid down to rest alone while the other\nFathers were laid to rest in pairs, but older versions of the story\nsuggest that it meant Durin alone had no female companion. The other\nFathers did: references are made by Tolkien to the “Thirteen Dwarves”\ncreated by Aulë (Durin and the six pairs). By this version of the story,\nDurin's Folk was formed out of Dwarves from the other six lines, as a\nmixed people arose when all Dwarves went to Gundabad."

The\nIron Mountains have always been associated with bitterly cold climates\npartly due to the influence of the evil Kingdom of Melkor. It was also\nthe former location of his ancient fortresses of Utumno and Angband.\nHistory After returning to Arda from the Outer Darkness with his allies\nthrough the Door of Night, Melkor created the Iron Mountains and behind\nthese walls safe from the light of the northern lamp Illuin he delved\nthe great fortress of Utumno. Angband was also delved into these\nmountains west of Utumno. After Melkor's destruction of the Two Lamps,\nthe Iron Mountains were connected to the Blue Mountains of the West to\nthe Orocarni of the east. Much later when the Valar decided to protect\nthe Elves from Melkor by defeating him and imprisoning him, the changing\nof the shape of Middle-earth effected the Iron Mountains as well.\nAfterwards, the mountain range was distorted but was still long with\nlengths stretching from the Helcaraxë in the far northwest to the\nOrocarni in the far east and rising to immense and frighting heights,\nwith enormous peaks such as Thangorodrim. In the days of the War of the\nJewels, the mountains protected Morgoth from being outflanked from the\nrear and with no enemy behind him, he was able to concentrate on the\nsouth. Because of its perilous heights, frightening looks, and foul\nwinds, no Elf ever passed through the mountains for any reason but the\nspies of Morgoth would always find ways into the Beleriand, by unknown\nways through the mountains. Morgoth's forces also captured Elves and\nbrought them through the mountains to Angband. After the War of Wrath\nthe Iron Mountains and Thangorodrim were destroyed and the vast mountain\nchain was broken and disappeared for a great part of their length. North\nof the range lay the Forodwaith, a region of ever-lasting cold.

    "text": "The TWO TREES OF VALINOR also known as the TREES OF THE VALAR,''' '''the\nTWO TREES: '''Laurelin '''(the Gold Tree) and '''Telperion '''(the\nSilver Tree), brought light into the Land of the Valar in ancient times.\nThey were destroyed by Melkor and Ungoliant, but their last flower and\nfruit were made by the Valar into the Sun and the Moon. Creation and\ndestruction The first sources of light for all of Arda were two enormous\nLamps, Illuin, the silver one to the north, and Ormal, the golden one to\nthe south. These were cast down and destroyed by Melkor. Afterward, the\nValar went to Valinor and Yavanna sang into existence the Two Trees,\nsilver Telperion and golden Laurelin. Telperion was considered male and\nLaurelin female. The Trees sat on the hill Ezellohar located outside\nValimar. They grew in the presence of all of the Valar, watered by the\ntears of Nienna. Each tree was a source of light: Telperion's silver and\nLaurelin's gold. Telperion had dark leaves (silver on one side) and his\nsilvery dew was collected as a source of water and of light. Laurelin\nhad gold-trimmed leaves and her dew was likewise collected by Varda. One\n“day” lasted twelve hours. Each Tree, in turn, would give off light for\nseven hours (waxing to full brightness and then slowly waning again), so\nthat at one hour each of “dawn” and “dusk” soft gold and silver light\nwould be given off together. Jealous, Melkor enlisted the help of the\ngiant spider-creature Ungoliant (the mother of Shelob) to destroy the\nTwo Trees. Concealed in Unlight, Melkor struck each Tree and the\ninsatiable Ungoliant devoured whatever life and light remained in them.\nAgain Yavanna sang and Nienna wept, but they succeeded only in reviving\nTelperion's last flower (to become the Moon) and Laurelin's last fruit\n(to become the Sun). These were assigned to lesser spirits, male Tilion\nand female Arien, after the 'genders' of the Trees themselves. This is\nwhy, in _The Lord of the Rings_, the Sun is usually referred to as “she”\nand the moon as “he”. However, the true light of the Trees, before their\npoisoning by Ungoliant, was said to afterwards reside only in the\nSilmarils. Telperion's descendants Because the Elves that first came to\nValinor especially loved Telperion, Yavanna made a second tree like it\nto stand in the city of Tirion where the Vanyar and Ñoldor dwelt\ntogether at first. This tree, named Galathilion, was identical to\nTelperion except that it gave no light of its own. It had many\nseedlings, one of which was planted in the isle of Tol Eressëa (named\nCELEBORN). In the Second Age, a seedling of Celeborn was brought as a\ngift to the Númenóreans - this was Nimloth, the White Tree of Númenor.\nIt lasted through the majority of the realm's duration, but when Sauron\ntook control of the island he commanded King Ar-Pharazôn to chop it\ndown. Fortunately Isildur managed to save a single fruit of that tree.\nOf this fruit later came the White Tree of Gondor. Internal significance\nThe Two Trees of Valinor existed at a time when the only other source of\nlight was the stars (which had been created for the Elves' benefit by\nVarda from the dews collected from the Two Trees). When three Elven\nambassadors were brought to see Valinor for themselves, in order that\nthe Elves might be convinced to come to Valinor, it seems that the Two\nTrees affected them most significantly. In particular Thingol is said to\nhave been motivated in the Great Journey by his desire to see the Light\nof Valinor again (until he finds contentment in the light he sees in\nMelian's face). Also in later times, the Elves would be divided between\nthe _CALAQUENDI_ who had seen the light of the Trees, and the\n_MORIQUENDI_ who hadn't; with the former group having found\nenlightenment and near rapture in the light they beheld. The\nSilmarillion repeatedly states that those Elves who saw the Two Trees\nwere mighty, with the light of Aman in their faces. As vassals of the\nValar, the trees somehow bestowed otherworldy power and understanding on\nthose who were exposed to them. Galadriel in particular had an affinity\nto Laurelin, as her hair was said to have captured the golden light of\nthat tree. In turn this inspired Feanor to make the jewels that could\nhold that same light; the Silmarils. The whole of the history of the\nFirst Age is strongly affected by the desire of many different\ncharacters to possess the Silmarils, which contain the only remaining\nunsullied light of the Trees. Yet upon his flight from Valinor after\ndestroying the light of the Two Trees, Melkor stole the Silmarils and\nsparked the Oath of Fëanor (who renamed Melkor Morgoth) and after many\nyears the Valar embarked on the War of Wrath, Which ended the First Age\nIn the Second and Third Ages, the White Trees of Númenor and of Gondor,\nwhose likeness descends from that of Telperion, have a mostly symbolic\nsignificance. They stand both as symbols of the kingdoms in question,\nand also as reminders of the ancestral alliance between the Dúnedain and\nthe Elves. Even in this late age the two trees are remembered by some.\nGandalf obviously remembers them with reverence, as he speaks of them to\nPippin. External significance Tolkien, as a Roman Catholic, would have\nbeen exposed to the significance of light in Catholic symbolism. Trees\nwere of special importance to him - in his short story _Leaf by Niggle_,\nwhich in a sense was an elaborate allegory explaining his own creative\nprocess, the protagonist spends his life painting a single Tree. The Two\nTrees represent the recurrent 'gold and silver' concept of the\nlegendarium. They are created after the lamps Ormal and Illuin - and\nfrom the trees themselves, the Sun and Moon are later created. Tolkien\nmay have also gotten inspiration for the trees directly from the Sun,\nwhich rises in the day (as Laurelin, the golden tree), and the moon\nwhich rises in the night (Telperion, the silver tree). Etymology Both\nTelperion and Laurelin are said to have been given many names among\nwhich are the following: Laurelin was also given the names of MALINALDA\nand CULÚRIEN,''' '''while Telperion was also named '''Silpion '''and\nNINQUELÓTË. Telperion's name in Valarin, the language of the Valar, is\nsaid to have been _IBRÎNIÐILPATHÂNEZEL_; Laurelin's name is recorded as\n_TULUKHEDELGORÛS._ In early writings of Tolkien, Telperion's names were\nSILPION , BANSIL, and BELTHIL. Quotations “Yet even as hope failed\nTelperion bore at last upon a leafless bough one great flower of silver,\nand Laurelin a single fruit of gold.” - _The Silmarillion_ “... and\nperceive the unimaginable hand and mind of Feanor at their work, while\nboth the White Tree and Golden were in flower!” Gandalf to Pippin, _The\nTwo Towers_ Notes - Tolkien could have taken the creation of light\nmentioned in Genesis as inspiration for the two trees, as both brought\nlight into Middle-earth and were turned into the moon and sun.",

The original was rediscovered by Saruman's\nagents while searching for the One Ring, and Aragorn later recovered it\nfrom amongst Saruman's treasure in Orthanc after the War of the Ring.

    "text": "CERIN AMROTH was a hill in the Elven realm of Lórien. Description Cerin\nAmroth had two circles of trees growing on it, the outer circle of trees\nwith white bark and the inner of Mallorn. When the wind blew through the\nbranches, the sound of far off seas and the cries of extinct sea-birds\ncould be heard. Niphredil and Elanor grew in the grass. History Cerin\nAmroth was the mound of Amroth, where Elanor flowers grew, that stood in\nthe heart of Lórien and held the house of that king before he was lost\nover a thousand years before. Aragorn comes to Cerin Amroth where he\nmeets lady Arwen again giving her the Ring of Barahir and where they\nboth plighted their troth. As the Fellowship of the Ring, fresh from\nMoria, entered into the beauty and safety Lothlorian and rest beside the\nstream Nimrodel, Frodo could hear a singing voice mingled with the sound\nof rippling water. Legolas remembered and sang the tragic tale of Amroth\nand Nimrodel. When Durin's Bane, the Balrog of Moria, was awakened, an\nevil arose that began to surround the peaceful forest of Lothlorien.\nThis became too much for Nimrodel to bare. She and her love, the King of\nLothlorien, Amroth, began their journey southwards towards the sea and\nthe undying lands. Nimrodel became lost in the White Mountains and\nperished never finding her way to Amroth who waited upon a boat tethered\nto the shore near Belfalas. A storm arose, driving the boat out to sea.\nIn desperation and love, Amroth lept from the boat to swim to shore,\nhoping to find Nimrodel, yet drowned in the dark stormy waters of the\nocean. Both lovers died painfully yearning to find each other. In this\nway sorrow first came to the land of Lorien. Until the days of the\nFellowship, the singing of Nimrodel could be heard in the falls near\nwhere she lived. The voice of Amroth can similarly be heard when the\nwind blows into Lorien from the south, where he had drowned. It is in\nthe mingling of the waters of the stream of Nimrodel, with the waters of\nthe Anduin and eventually the ocean, the two lovers are symbolically\nunited. The Fellowship of the Ring stopped at Cerin Amroth as they were\nbeing escorted through Lórien to the Lord and Lady in Caras Galadhon by\nHaldir. Frodo could feel the southern wind blow upon Cerin Amroth,\ncarrying the sounds and sights of the southern ocean. Frodo Baggins and\nSam Gamgee followed Haldir up to the flet built in the center tree while\nthe others rested in the grass. Frodo saw Caras Galadhon from the flet.\nHe could see Anduin the Great and Southern Mirkwood corrupted by Dol\nGuldur. Returning to the grass at the foot of Cerin Amroth, Frodo finds\nAragorn playing with an elanor flower, lost in memory. He sees him as if\nclothed in white as a young lord tall and fair, speaking elvish to\nsomeone he cannot see. Aragorn speaks in Elvish “fair Arwen, fairwell”\nthen looks towards Frodo and smiles. It was here where Arwen, after\nAragorn's death, went to die, in the place Aragorn had proposed to her,\nsometime before the spring of FO 121 and was where her grave was\nlocated."

    "text": "THE DOOR OF NIGHT (also called MORITARNON or TARN FUI) was a place set\nat the utmost West of Arda near the Void. The Door was created by the\nValar at the time of the making of the Sun and Moon. It was vital in the\ncosmology of Middle-earth, forming the border between Arda and the void,\nas well as being the final prison of the renegade Vala Morgoth Bauglir.\nCreation The Door was created by the Valar as a gateway for the Sun to\npass through. According to others, though, it was made expressly as a\ngateway through which to expel Morgoth. The following text describes the\ncreation of the Door in the _Ainulindale_: _Thus came it that the Gods\ndared a very great deed, the most mighty of their works; for making a\nfleet of magic rafts and boats with Ulmo's aid - and otherwise had none\nof these endured to sail upon the waters of Vai - they drew to the Wall\nof Things, and there they made the Door of Night._ Purpose The Sun was\nto pass through the Door of Night as it travelled above Arda. When the\nSun passed through the Door, night would fall upon Middle-earth. The\nMoon would then rise from its resting place and continue on its path\nover the Earth. The Sun would traverse the border of the Wall of the\nWorld, re-entering the world in the East, at the Gates of Morning. At\nthe same time the Moon would be sinking in the West and a new day would\nbegin. At the conclusion of the War of Wrath, when Eärendil the Mariner\nsailed to Aman to beseech the aid of the Valar, Morgoth was imprisoned\noutside the Door of Night. The following is told in _The Silmarillion_:\n_“But Morgoth himself the Valar thrust through the Door of Night beyond\nthe Walls of the World, into the Timeless Void; and a guard is set\nforever on those walls, and Eärendil keeps watch upon the ramparts of\nthe sky.”_ At the “End of Days” (which is referenced to even in _The\nLord of the Rings_ by Gandalf, Tom Bombadil, and others), Morgoth shall\nreturn as Melkor by breaking the Door of Night, precipitating the Last\nBattle (Dagor Dagorath). Location A description of the location of the\nDoor of Night is found in _The Book of Lost Tales Part One_: _About the\nWorld are the Ilurambar, or Walls of the World. They are as ice and\nglass and steel, being above all the imagination of the Children of\nEarth cold, transparent, and hard. They cannot be seen, nor can they be\npassed, save by the Door of Night. Within these walls the Earth is\nglobed: above, below and upon all sides is Vaiya, the Enfolding Ocean.\nBut this is more like to sea below the Earth and more like to air above\nthe Earth._ Appearance The Door of Night was likened to a huge gate of\nstone at the very edge of the world: the _Ilurambar_, invisible Walls of\nthe World. _There it still stands, utterly black and huge against the\ndeep-blue walls. Its pillars are of the mightiest basalt and its lintel\nlikewise, but great dragons of black stone are carved thereon, and\nshadowy smoke pours slowly from their jaws._ Fate In the _Book of Lost\nTales Part One_ the fate of the Door of Night in the West, and its\ncounterpart, the Gates of Morning in the East, are documented as\nfollows: _For 'tis said ere the Great end come Melko shall in some wise\ncontrive a quarrel between Moon and Sun, and Ilinsor shall seek to\nfollow Urwendi through the Gates, and when they are gone the Gates of\nboth East and West will be destroyed, and Urwendi and Ilinsor shall be\nlost._"

    "text": "BARAD EITHEL also known as EITHEL SIRION was the main fortress and\ncapital of the realm of Fingolfin and Fingon, while it endured. It was\nlocated in the mountainous eastern foothills of the Ered Wethrin, at the\nsource of the River Sirion, just outside Hithlum, some sixty miles from\nThangorodrim. It was attacked and besieged many times during the First\nAge by the forces of Morgoth. When Men came into the service of the\nÑoldor, it was entrusted to the House of Hador. It survived the Dagor\nBragollach but was conquered and occupied by the enemy after the\nNirnaeth Arnoediad. History Barad Eithel guarded a pass over the Ered\nWethrin into Hithlum, the realm of Fingolfin, the High King of the\nÑoldor. There were several mountain fortresses along the eastern border,\nbut Barad Eithel was Fingolfin's primary stronghold. Cavalry based at\nBarad Eithel patrolled the plains of Ard-galen. During the Dagor\nBragollach in FA 455, rivers of fire from Angband turned the grassy\nplain of Ard-galen into Anfauglith. The Elves of Hithlum and their\nallies the Men of Dor-lómin were driven back to the mountain forts.\nDuring the Siege of Angband, Barad Eithel lay at the heart of the\nNoldor's defences, and also guarded the passes westward into Hithlum.\nThroughout the siege, Elves of Fingolfin's people would patrol the green\nfields of Ard-galen, holding Morgoth within his fortress at Angband,\nclose by to the north. That changed in the Dagor Bragollach, when the\nplains of Ard-galen were overrun with rivers of fire and turned to\nscorching dust. Armies of Orcs assailed Fingolfin's city, but it held\nfirm, though Hador, the Lord of Dor-lómin and his younger son Gundor\nwere both lost in its defence, in front of the fortress's walls. Looking\nout across the burning desert in despair, Fingolfin set out from Barad\nEithel to challenge Morgoth to single combat, and was lost. His son\nFingon became the High King of the Ñoldor in his place, and took up his\nrule from Eithel Sirion. Though the Siege of Angband had been broken,\nBarad Eithel still held, and so the passes into Hithlum remained secure.\nMorgoth resolved to break this defence, and sent another army seven\nyears after the Dagor Bragollach to overcome Fingon's forces. Again they\nwere repulsed, but Galdor was slain in the attack, where his father\nHador had fallen just seven years before. Galdor was killed by an arrow.\nHis son Húrin then, drove the enemy forces back from Barad Eithel and\npursued them across Anfauglith. When the Elves came together for a vast\nnew assault on Morgoth, Barad Eithel was the staging post for the\nwestern armies. It was from there that the soldiers of Fingon swept\nacross the dusty remnant of Ard-galen, in the glorious beginning of the\nbattle that would turn to the tragedy of the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.\nGelmir's brother Gwindor was on the outworks of Barad Eithel, and in his\nanger he launched a premature attack against Morgoth's forces. Fingon\nordered his troops to follow and advance on Angband, but despite their\ninitial success they were ultimately defeated in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad.\nFingon was killed and no Elves returned to Hithlum, which Morgoth gave\nto the Easterlings. Though the fate of Barad Eithel in that battle is\npolemical described, the fact that Fingon's realm was destroyed and\nHithlum occupied must mean that the fortress at Eithel Sirion was\ncaptured or destroyed. By the last years of the First Age, if\nFingolfin's mountain fortress was not in the hands of the Orcs, it would\nhave fallen into ruin and decay. Etymology The name _BARAD EITHEL_ means\n“Tower of the Well” in Sindarin from _barad_ meaning “tower” and\n_eithel_ meaning “well, spring”."

The host of Fingolfin,\nwhich had been betrayed by Fëanor in Aman, had managed the\nnear-impossible crossing of the Helcaraxë and had arrived in\nMiddle-earth, its members bitter and furious.

There was an envelopment and the Orcs were caught in\nthe vice of Fingolfin from the west and Maedhros from the east. Most\nOrcs were destroyed, and they retreated to Angband. The Ñoldor pursued,\nand utterly destroyed their enemies in sight of the gates of Angband.\nThis was the first complete victory over Morgoth, and after it the\nÑoldor maintained a guard on Angband, beginning the period of watchful\npeace known as the Siege of Angband.

History The\nencirclement of Angband was incomplete, as Morgoth was still capable of\nsending out various forces of Orcs to weaken the Ñoldor (such as the\nattack of Hithlum), mainly from the impassable north flanks of the\nfortress near the unguarded Iron Mountains. The Ñoldor had grown strong\nenough, however, and these raiding forces posed no significant threat.\nBut these raids enabled Morgoth to coerce people who were captured to\nhis service, which would later prove very disastrous to the Ñoldor and\ntheir allies. Though considered by Fingolfin, the Elves never planned in\nearnest nor executed any sort of offensive action against Angband. The\nElven kingdoms had prospered greatly during the time of the siege, and\nmost were unwilling to engage in a seemingly needless battle in which\nthey believed innumerable Elves would perish, whether in victory or\ndefeat.

History It was a route that leaves the\nearth's curvature through sky and space to the ethereal land of Aman.\nThe route could be compared to going on a spaceship or crossing into a\nparallel universe. The Straight Road, so called because it followed the\nold path across Belegaer from before the Akallabêth when the Flat World\nto the World Made Round, was only kept open to Elves, who were allowed\nto sail to it on their ships by a special grace of the Valar. A ship\ndeparting on the Straight Road, when observed from the shore, would\nslowly become smaller to sight until it disappeared in a point, and not\ndrop behind the horizon. It is noted in earlier writings by Tolkien that\nsome mortals besides those carried on Elven ships like the Fellowship of\nthe Ring and Bilbo Baggins can also find this route in a Bermuda\nTriangle-like instance (like Ælfwine or _Eriol_ from _The Book of Lost\nTales_). According to unfinished notes for _The Lost Road_ (and somewhat\nrelated to later in _The Notion Club Papers_), Tolkien saw the location\nof the Straight Road as possibly somewhere near the Azores in modern\ntimes.__ The first location reached from the hidden path was Tol Eressëa\n(to some known as Avallon or Avalon). As noted at the end of the\nAkallabêth it mentions of tales and rumours concerning mariners and men\nlost upon the sea whom, by some fate or grace or favour of the Valar,\nhad entered upon the path until they reached Avallonë. Tolkien main\ntravelers to reach the island included first possibly Tuor, then\nEärendil, later Ælfwine, the body of King Arthur, and even hinted at\nLancelot making the journey as well. _The Notion Club Papers_ even hints\nat others who maybe made the journey either physically or by dreams to\nbecome known as “Elf-friend” (“Ælfwine”) down through the ages.

    "text": "The DISASTER OF THE GLADDEN FIELDS or the BATTLE OF THE GLADDEN FIELDS\nwas a battle at the beginning of the Third Age, in which Isildur and a\nretinue of the Dúnedain of Arnor, marching home after the defeat of\nSauron, were attacked by a large group of Orcs from the Misty Mountains.\nThe king and his three eldest sons -- Elendur, Aratan, and Ciryon --\nwere slain and the Ring of Power was lost in the River Anduin. Only\nthree men survived the encounter, but the shards of Narsil were saved by\nOhtar, an esquire of the king.  The repercussions of the attack were\nwide-ranging, as Isildur had been king of both Gondor and Arnor, and his\ndeath left the two kingdoms to separate into isolated realms. Arnor\nwouldn't be able to completely recover from this catastrophic loss of a\nconsiderable part of its nobles and knights until the kingship of\nAragorn II Elessar of the Elendili in the Fourth Age. However, most\nimportantly, Isildur's death prevented him from passing on the One Ring\nto the Keepers of the Three, which he had divulged to his son Elendur to\nbe his chief reason for visiting Elrond in Rivendell. History Prelude\nAfter that War of the Alliance, Isildur remained in Gondor for a year,\nregaining lost territories, and reorganising the realm. He sent the\ngreater part of the armies of Arnor back to Eriador via the Númenórean\nroad from the Fords of Isen to Fornost. After he was done with arranging\nthe affairs of the southern realm, he delivered the South Kingdom to\nMeneldil and forthwith designed to march to Rivendell. He had left his\nwife and youngest son there, yet he also greatly desired the counsel of\nElrond at that time. It was for this reason that he proceeded from\nOsgiliath into the Vale of the Anduin, and over the Cirith Forn en\nAndrath, which was the high-climbing pass of the Northern Misty\nMountains which led down into the valley of Rivendell.  The Battle The\nDúnedain host had traveled northwards from Lórien, marching along a path\nthat led to Greenwood the Great wherein Thranduil was king. Their route\nhad been diverted by the flooding of the Anduin, which had compelled\nIsildur to take the road on the sheer slopes on the eastern banks of the\nriver. King Isildur's party was flanked on its left by steep cliffs\noverlooking the River Anduin, and to its left, by hills and a forest.\nThe Dúnedain were singing marching songs and generally of good cheer as\ndusk drew close, at which time the lusty men heard the strain of orcs in\nthe forest hills. Isildur organised his retinue into a “Thangail,” a\nshield-wall two men deep and flexible at the flanks; it could be made to\nback up completely so as to form a defensive ring should the unit be\nsurrounded. The Dúnedain could only guess at the strength of the enemy,\nbut they perceived that the orc host was many times, perhaps even 10\ntimes as large as their own. Isildur expressed regret that the orcs\nshould have approached them at such uneven ground, for had it been level\nor rather downhill for the Dúnedain, then they should have formed up\ninto a “Dírnaith”, a wedge formation that could have shattered the\nmiscreant orcs.  The first orc onslaught came quickly, striking at the\ncenter of the Dúnedain line after a volley of arrows had been fired. At\nthis point, Isildur sent for his esquire, Ohtar, to take the shards of\nNarsil to Rivendell for safekeeping should the battle go ill. The orcs\nwere discomfited at no cost among the Dúnedain, all of whom towered\nabove the tallest of the orcs. Piles of orcs had gathered before the\nDúnedain, and the orcs again kept their distance out of range of the\npowerful Númenórean bows. Isildur judged that the orcs, in their\ntypically craven fashion, were so thoroughly dismayed to be stung so\nbadly in the fight that they would not resume battle, but would rather\nstalk the Dúnedain from a distance. The king then resolved to bring his\nretinue onto lower and more level ground, yet the host had not marched\nmore than a mile before the orcs returned again. Hope faded as the orcs\ncrept towards them in silence and under cover of darkness. In this\nsecond attack, the orcs approached in a full crescent, resolving to\npressure the Dúnedain at all points in their formation. Men were slain,\nand the formation started crumbling. Yet the Men of Númenór did their\nsires honour, for many died at the cost of five orcs each. Ciryon and\nAratan were killed, and Elendur convinced Isildur to flee and cross the\nAnduin if he could, on whose other side he might find safety and make\nhis way to Rivendell.  The Route of Isildur Isildur then cloaked himself\nwith the ring, and sped down into the valley. He made a long journey to\nthe banks of the Anduin, and there parted with all of his arms and\narmour save for a short sword. The river was hard to cross, thus, though\nrarely equaled in strength and vigour even by fellow Dúnedain, Isildur\nwas exhausted when he reached the western shallows. There, reeds and\nrushes tangled him and the ring abandoned him, slipping from his\nfingers. Orc prowlers then caught sight of the large and imposing\nfigure, and out of fear they shot at him and fled quickly, having\npierced him in throat and heart.  Aftermath Only Ohtar, and an unnamed\ncompanion; and a stunned combatant and esquire of Elendur, Estelmo, had\nsurvived the disaster. Isildur's body was never recovered by men, and\nwas secretly presumed captured and mutilated at Sauron's command. The\norc host which had waylaid the Dúnedain were quickly scattered by a\nrelief force of woodsmen which none-the-less had come too late to affect\nthe fate of the king's retinue. The orc victory had been so Pyrrhic that\nit would take them many years before they would gather the strength to\nventure out again in the Vales of Anduin. Estelmo was recovered alive,\nbut stunned from a club's blow, and he told of how Isildur and Elendur\nhad related to each other about the One Ring before their deaths.\nIsildur remarked: “I cannot use it. I dread the pain of touching it. And\nI have not yet found the strength to bend it to my will. It needs one\ngreater than I know myself to be. My pride has fallen. It should go to\nthe Keepers of the Three.” Then, probably the biggest consequences of\nthe Gladden Fields was that the union of Arnor and Gondor was broken by\nblood, but more importantly; that Isildur never managed to give the Ring\nof Power to Elrond, Galadriel and Celeborn. All of them would have most\nlikely decided to destroy it long before Sauron could have gathered his\nspirit again and refortified Mordor; in effect destroying the Dark Lord\nin the same way he was extinguished beyond all hope of recovery by\nFrodo."

    "text": "The '''Barrow-wights '''were shape-shifting beings of darkness, similar\nin circumstance to Wraiths, who dwelt in dark places of Eriador such as\nthe Barrow-downs. The characteristic of shape-shifter gave Barrow-wights\nthe ability to reanimate whatever life-form they wished. The ones which\nattacked the four Hobbits reanimated the corpses of the Kings of the\nBarrows. Most often the Barrow-wight came on the unwary traveller in the\nguise of a dark phantom whose eyes were luminous and cold. The voice of\nthe figure was at once horrible and hypnotic; its skeletal hand had a\ntouch like ice and a grip like the iron jaws of a trap. Once under the\nspell, the victim had no will of his own. In this way the Barrow-wights\ndrew the living into the tombs of the downs. A dismal choir of tortured\nsouls could be heard inside the Barrow as, in the green half-light, the\nBarrow-wight laid his victim on a stone altar and bound him in chains of\ngold. He draped him in pale cloth and precious jewelry of the ancient\ndead, and with a sacrificial sword ended them. East of the Brandywine\nRiver beyond the Old Forest were the Barrow-downs, the most ancient\nburial ground of men in Middle-earth. There were no trees nor water\nthere, but only grass and turf covering dome-shaped hills that were\ncrowned with monoliths and great rings of bone-white stone. These hills\nwere the burial mounds that were made in the First Age of the Sun for\nthe Kings of Men. For many ages the Barrow-downs were sacred and\nrevered, until out of the Kingdom of Angmar many terrible and tortured\nspirits fled across Middle-earth, desperately searching to hide from the\nravening light of the Sun. Demons whose bodies had been destroyed looked\nfor other bodies in which their evil spirits could dwell. And so it was\nthat the Barrow-downs became a haunted and terrible place. The demons\nbecame Barrow-wights, the Undead who animated the bones and jeweled\narmor of the ancient Kings of Men who had lived in the First Age of the\nSun. In the darkness they were powerful spirits and they could be held\nat bay only with the spell of strong incantations, such as Tom\nBombadil's song. However, normally they could be destroyed only by\nexposure to light, the entity they hated and feared the most. The\nBarrow-wights were lost and tortured spirits, and their last chance to\nremain upon Earth depended on the dark security of burial vaults. Once\nthe stone chamber was broken open, light would pour in on the\nBarrow-wights and they would fade like mist before the sun and be gone\nforever. History The Barrow-wights began appearing in the Barrow-downs\nafter the Dúnedain of Cardolan succumbed to the ravages of the Great\nPlague. They were put there by sorcerers of Angmar who corrupted the\nsouls of the inhabitants of the Barrow-downs. The sorcerers were sent by\nthe Witch-king of Angmar who wished to keep the Dúnedain away from\nthere. On September 28 of 3018 Frodo Baggins and his companions, Sam\nGamgee, Merry, and Pippin while passing through the Barrow-downs were\ncaptured one by one by the Barrow-wights, and trapped in what was\nbelieved to be the cairn of the last prince of Cardolan. There they were\nalmost slain by a wight; three of the Hobbits had been lain in a barrow\nfilled with a strange green light and were dressed in white robes and\nwore jewels and gold and had a sword across their necks. The wight had\nfinished an incantation, and was preparing to finish them off when Frodo\nsummoned up the courage to slice off its hand; he then called upon Tom\nBombadil when the wight extinguished the dim light in the cavern.\nBombadil performed some kind of exorcism on the barrow, through the rare\npower of his singing, which caused the wight to flee with a shriek; he\nthen gave the hobbits swords and then spread out the gold and treasures\nfrom the barrow on the grass, so that the barrow's spell was broken and\nno Wight could make habitat there."

History While the Ñoldor were still struggling in\nAman, Morgoth had already arrived in Middle-earth well ahead of them,\nand quickly reoccupied his old fortress of Angband where his servants\nSauron and Gothmog had long been breeding Orcs in the darkness. Morgoth\nmoved quickly to resume his desire to conquer and dominate the peoples\nof Middle-earth and sent forth his armies hoping to master all the areas\nsouth of his domain quickly. Morgoth's forces issued forth in two main\nhosts, passing west through the vale of Sirion and east between Aros and\nGelion, some of them even scaling the passes of Anach and Aglon.\nWell-armed having defended the Beleriand from the evil and savage things\nof the north, King Thingol were prepared for war but faced setbacks. The\nwestern Orc host ravaged and plundered much in the West Beleriand. Lord\nCírdan of the Havens of the Falas came out to meet them but was defeated\nand forced to retreat into the walled cities of Eglarest and Brithombar,\nwere they were besieged. Thus, the forces of Thingol were cut-off from\ntheir Elven allies in the west. Detachments of both Orc hosts entered\nthe domain of Thingol and Menegroth, Thingol's forces fought and held\nthem at bay but his main focus was on the bulk of the eastern Orc host\nfighting his hard-pressed ally, King Denethor of the Laiquendi.\nDenethor, who answered Thingol's call for aid attacked the Orcs but he\nand his people were lightly armed and were no match for the arms of\ntheir foes. Eventually, he and his forces were pushed back onto Amon\nEreb where they were cut-off and surrounded. Here, Denethor and his\nlightly armed company made their last stand against a sea of foes and he\nwas slain before Thingol could rescue him. When Thingol's forces\narrived, the Orcs stood no chance and were utterly defeated. Those Orcs\nthat did escape death scattered east but were slain by the Dwarves of\nMount Dolmed. The battle was over and the armies of Thingol stood\nvictorious over Morgoth's forces in the East Beleriand. This was the\nonly battle against the Dark Lord in which the Sindar took an active\nrole. Aftermath Thought battle was held to be over, the cities of the\nHavens remained under siege by the forces of the Western Orc host. After\nlearning of this, Thingol summoned all the Sindar that wished to live in\npeace to the lands within the forests of Region and Neldoreth. Melian\nthen set forth her powers and afterwards the lands of Thingol became a\nclosed realm and was put under protection by the magical barrier _Girdle\nof Melian_, which were ever after known as Doriath. As no aid came from\nThingol, Lord Círdan and his people had to hold out against his\nattackers alone. The Havens were only freed when the Orcs withdrew\nnortheast to fight the Ñoldor under Fëanor. After the death of their\nking and the heavy losses they took during battle, the Laiquendi\nreturned to the forests of the Ossiriand. There they pledged to live in\nsecrecy forsaking war and distrusting outsiders. They never again named\na king.

History The battle began\nwhen the Ñoldor of Fëanor arrived unexpectedly at the Firth of Drengist,\nand passed through the Gate of the Noldor into Hithlum. They encamped on\nthe northern shore of Lake Mithrim. Morgoth hoped to destroy the\nreturning Ñoldor before they could establish themselves, and sent his\nforces through the passes of the Ered Wethrin. Although the Orcs of\nMorgoth by far outnumbered the Ñoldor, the Ñoldor were still empowered\nwith the Light of Valinor, and quickly defeated them. The Orcs retreated\nnorth through Ard-galen, with the Ñoldor in hot pursuit. The forces of\nMorgoth that had been besieging the Havens of the Falas since the First\nBattle of Beleriand marched north to attack the Ñoldor in the rear, but\na force led by Celegorm ambushed them at Eithel Sirion. Trapped between\nthe two Ñoldorin forces, the Orcs fought for ten days, encircled at the\nFens of Serech. All but a few Orcs perished in the battle, and Fëanor in\nhis wrath pursued even this small group. But he drew too far ahead of\nthe main host of his people, and seeing this, the Orcs turned and gave\nbattle at the edge of Dor Daedeloth. Being virtually at Angband's gates,\nthe Orcs were joined by a number of Balrogs, and the Elves were quickly\nslain. Fëanor stood his ground and long fought alone, until he was\nfatally wounded by Gothmog. However, before the Balrogs could kill him,\nFëanor was rescued by his sons. Fëanor would die soon afterwards due to\nhis wounds. Immediately following this skirmish, the Moon rose, and with\nits rising Fingolfin and the second, greater host of the Ñoldor arrived\nin Lhammoth. There they were attacked by a force of Orcs which had\nearlier been sent there by Morgoth to attack Fëanor in the rear, and\nthey fought their first battle, the Battle of Lhammoth. The Ñoldor were\ncaught off-guard, and Fingolfin's son Argon was slain. Fingolfin and his\nhost pursued the Orcs until they were completely destroyed, and then\npassed into Mithrim as the Moon first rose. The victory was decisive for\nthe Ñoldor, who had destroyed most of Morgoth's forces in one mortal\nstrike, but they had lost their greatest war-leader and one of their\ngreatest princes. Etymology _DAGOR-NUIN-GILIATH_ was Sindarin for\n'battle-beneath-stars'. Notes The Battle of Lhammoth and Argon do not\nappear in the published _The Silmarillion_ at all, because they only\ncame to light in very late writings by Tolkien. In the published The\nSilmarillion, Fingolfin's host only arrives after the battle is long\nover.

They were counted amongst the Edain.\nHistory The Drúedain developed a close relationship with the Folk of\nHaleth, the Edain that inhabited that forest region. The Drúedain lived\namong the Second House of Men, the Haladin, in the First Age in the\nforest of Brethil. There were also a number of the Drúedain present in\nNúmenor, though they had left or died out before the Akallabêth, as had\nthe Púkel-men of Dunharrow. At the end of the Third Age, the Drûg still\nlived in the Drúadan Forest of the White Mountains, and on the long cape\nof Andrast west of Gondor. The region north of Andrast was still known\nas Drúwaith Iaur, or “Old Drûg land”. The Woses of Ghân-buri-Ghân held\noff Orcs with poisoned arrows and were vital in securing the aid of the\nRohirrim in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. After the War of the\nRing, King Aragorn II Elessar granted the Drúadan Forest “forever” to\nthem in the Fourth Age, promising that no man would enter their forests\nwithout the leave of the Drúedain. Physical characteristics They were an\nalien folk to the other Men: a bit like Dwarves in stature and\nendurance, stumpy, clumsy-limbed (with short, thick legs, and fat,\n“gnarled” arms), had broad chests, fat bellies, and heavy buttocks.\nAccording to the Elves and other Men, they had “unlovely faces”: wide,\nflat, and expressionless with deep-set black eyes that glowed red when\nangered. They had “horny” brows, flat noses, wide mouths, and sparse,\nlanky hair. They had no hair lower than the eyebrows, except for a few\nmen who had a tail of black hair on the chin. They were short lived and\nhad a deep hatred of Orcs. Their characteristics may have originated in\nthe First Age. People who didn't know them very well may have thought\nthat Morgoth may have captured some men as they did with the elves and\nbred Orcs from their stock leading to the conclusion that the Drúedain\ncould have possibly been Men that escaped, but were more deformed but\nnot very Orc-like. Evidence for this is that both they and Orcs consider\neach other renegades. They were known to have certain magical powers and\nto be still in meditation for long periods of time. Etymology Other\nnames - DRÛG/DRUGHU: (singular and plural) is the name the Drúedain give\nto themselves in their own language and the name used for a race known\nto the Elves as the Drúedain, and to Men. - DRÚATH: (plural) was an\nearlier Sindarin name for them in ancient times. - RÓG/RÓGIN: (singular\nand plural) is the name that the Rohirrim have for them in their own\nlanguage. - RÚ/RÚATANI: (singular and plural) is their name in Quenya. -\nWOSE/WOSES: (singular and plural) was a word Tolkien took from an Old\nEnglish word, which was meant to be a translation of the Rohhirric\n'Róg'. - OGHOR-HAI: (singular and plural) is the name the Orcs gave to\nthem. Origin Tolkien got this term from the legendary Woodwoses of\nEuropean myths.",

Within it was the beautifully decorated Hall of Thingol\nwhere sat his throne and where he dispensed his judgments. It was there\nthat Thingol was slain by the Dwarven craftsmen of Nogrod. The quest\nof Beren to gain a Silmaril begins at Menegroth. It is also here that\nLúthien the fair was born. It was later sacked by the Sons of Fëanor in\npursuit of one of the Silmarils taken from Morgoth's Iron Crown prior to\nthe War of Wrath. History Years of the Trees In the years after the War\nfor Sake of the Elves, the Teleri were scattered all over Beleriand in\nhavens such as Falas or in the woodlands at Region and Neldoreth. Their\nleader Elwë disappeared for a long time in the woods with Melian, his\nbeloved. Then, he and Melian reappeared calling himself Thingol, was\nurged to build a home for his people, so he had the Dwarves of\nBelegost to aid in the construction of a new fortress. It was dug into\nthe western wall of the ravine above the river Esgalduin and had only\none entrance high above the river accessible by a large stone bridge. It\nwas named Menegroth or the Thousand Caves because of the extensive\nnumber of caverns and chambers within all hewn of stone and beautifully\ndecorated with carvings of beech trees and birds. These were many\ndifferent places including armories, treasures, smithies, and living\nquarters for both the Elves and Dwarves. During the Years of the Trees,\nDoriath received peace for a long while as Thingol preferred isolation\nand ordered his people not to mingle in the affairs of the Noldor due to\nthe Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and the Quenyan language was forbidden in\nhis realm. Only with his kin in Nargothrond did Thingol remain in\ncontact with. He did not take part in any of the later Battles of\nBeleriand relating to the struggle with Morgoth. Sometime during mid\nFirst Age, Beren Erchamion asked Thingol's daughter, Lúthien, for her\nhand in marriage, but the King demanded that Beren was to go on a quest\nto retrieve a Silmaril from Morgoth's Iron Crown. Lúthien accompanied\nhim on the quest to Angband and they succeeded in eventually retrieving\nthe jewel; but the stakes were high. Carcharoth, a wolf guarding the\nGates of Angband, bit off Beren's hand in which he was holding the\nSilmaril. The wolf ventured to Menegroth, ravaging the lands in his\npath, and broke through its boundaries. He was confronted by the brave\nHuan, the Great Hound of Valinor, on the north-east banks of Esgalduin\nand was killed in the brawl. The Silmaril was found in the wolf's\nstomach, after swallowing it in Beren's hand, and was given to King\nThingol. Sack of Doriath Years later, Hurin Thalion brought the famed\nNauglamir as a gift to Thingol. Thingol contemplated a plan to set the\nSilmaril into the Nauglamir. He offered a reward to the Dwarven\ncraftsmen of Nogrod if they succeeded in setting the stone into the\nNauglamir. A great desire for the Silmaril possessed the Dwarves and\nthey formed a greed to own both the jewel and the Nauglamir. They\nfinished the work and subsequently claimed the treasure for themselves,\nslew Thingol, and fled Menegroth.  The news spread fast and the Dwarves\nwere hunted for and then slain. Two escaped and and told a tale of lies\nabout their ''betrayal ''and their brethren being _slaughtered_ by the\nElves._ _The Dwarves of Nogrod formed a great army and rose in anger at\nthe elves and invaded the now unguarded Doriath._ _This led to the\nBattle of the Thousand Caves_ _in which many were slain on both sides.\nMablung, the leader of the guard, was slaughtered at the doors of the\ntreasure chamber where the Nauglamir was held. The Dwarves of Nogrod\nwere then waylaid at Sarn Athrad on their return by the Laiquendi led by\nBeren. Their King was slain by Beren in single combat and the remainder\nof their host were felled by Ents. Etymology _MENEGROTH_ is a Sindarin\nword. Lay of Leithian ...through corridors of carven dread whose turns\nwere lit by lanterns hung or flames from torches that were flung on\ndragons hewn in the cold stone with jewelled eyes and teeth of bone.\nThen sudden, deep beneath the earth the silences with silver mirth were\nshaken and the rocks were ringing, the birds of Melian were singing; and\nwide the ways of shadows spread as into arched halls she led Beren in\nwonder. There a light like day immortal and like night of stars\nunclouded, shone and gleamed. A vault of topless trees it seemed, whose\ntrunks of carven stone there stood like towers of an enchanted wood in\nmagic fast for ever bound, bearing a roof whose branches wound in\nendless tracery of green lit by some leaf-imprisoned sheen of moon and\nsun, and wrought of gems, and each leaf hung on golden stems. Lo! there\namid immortal flowers the nightingales in shining bowers sang o'er the\nhead of Melian, while water for ever dripped and ran from fountains in\nthe rocky floor. There Thingol sat.

    "text": "The NORTHMEN, also known as the FREE MEN OF THE NORTH,''' '''were Men\nthat lived in the north of Rhovanion in Middle-earth, and were friendly\nto Gondor. History The Northmen who dwelt in the Greenwood and other\nparts of Rhovanion were friendly to the Dúnedain and were, after the\nDúnedain, some of the most noble Men in Arda. They were known as Middle\nMen by the Dúnedain, and were believed to have been descended from the\nsame group of Men as the Edain, the Atanatári. The only difference was\nthat they didn't cross the Blue Mountains into Beleriand, and therefore\ndid not journey to Númenor. The result of them not participating in the\nWar against Morgoth was their considerably shorter lifespan; the\nlifespan of the Dúnedain being lengthened by the Valar after the War of\nWrath. They were important allies of Gondor and served as a buffer\nagainst the Easterlings and other foes. For a time many of them even\nbecame subjects of Gondor, as the realm extended beyond the river\nAnduin. East of Greenwood the Great was the kingdom of Rhovanion, and\nthis became the most important nation of the Northmen. In the fourteenth\ncentury of the Third Age, King Rómendacil II of Gondor sent his son\nValacar as an ambassador to Vidugavia, the so-called “King of\nRhovanion”. Valacar loved Rhovanion and the daughter of the King,\nVidumavi. He married her and she bore him a son whom she called\n_Vinitharya_ in her mother tongue. In Gondor, Vinitharya became known as\nKing Eldacar and caused a civil war- the Kin-strife- because of his\nmixed Dúnedain/Northmen blood. Shortly after the death of Vidugavia, a\nsmall group of Northmen moved to the vales of the Anduin between the\nGladden Fields and the Mirkwood, probably to flee from the Wainriders,\nwho had enslaved much of the people of Rhovanion. After the evil Kingdom\nof Angmar was defeated by Gondor and the remains of Arnor in TA 1977,\nthese Northmen moved north and began to call themselves the Éothéod.\nThey were skilled horse breeders and horsemen. In TA 2510 they responded\nto a plea of help from the trapped Gondor army at the Field of\nCelebrant. After they helped Gondor win this important victory, they\nwere rewarded the province of Calenardhon and became known as the\nRohirrim. The Men of Rohan who fought on foot were called 'Yeomen'. The\nMen of Dale and Lake-town were also counted under the Northmen, as were\nthe woodsmen of Mirkwood. Most of Rhovanion had been depopulated after\nthe wars of the Easterlings and the Great Plague. Their range was\nextremely wide; the Men of the North ranged to the western eaves of\nMirkwood to the southern slopes of the Grey Mountains and from the Long\nLake to Dorwinion on the Sea of Rhun. In ''the Hobbit, ''these men\ncarved out a potentially precarious living in the eaves of Mirkwood,\nliving as hunters, loggers, trappers, and fishermen on the Anduin and\nits tributaries. They also lived in constant fear of attack from Dol\nGuldur. Military The larger, more established kingdoms of the North\n(such as Dale and Laketown) would have at least some semblance of a\nregular standing army. These would have mostly consisted of a force of\ndismounted men-at-arms, armed with a sword and a wooden shield. The Men\nof the North might have received some help from Gondor in metalworking,\nalong with their Dwarven allies nearby. A militia or town guard would\nhave also been used extensively, for the majority of the humans in the\nnorth were farmers and thus needed their full attention kept on the\nall-important harvest. Further up the military hierarchy would be a\nforce of axemen, for many of the woodcutters and loggers in Mirkwood\nwould have learned to use the axe from adolescence. A force of mounted\nknights and light cavalry would probably have been available for\nscouting and other duties, for the terrain from Dale to Dorwinion is\nmostly flat and featureless, except for a few trees, shrubs, and ponds\nscattered randomly. By contrast, the rural, less established kingdom of\nRohan trains almost every legitimate soldier it has to fight from\nhorseback, while the infantry division is left to be composed of not\nsoldiers but, as Gamling states in The Two Towers, “every villager able\nto wield a sword”. Languages Being human means that the Northmen spoke\nthe Common Speech. However, they also have native languages. For\nexample, the Rohirrim spoke Rohirric, for which Tolkien appears to have\nbeen inspired by Old English, seeing names like “Éowyn” and “Thengel”.\nWhereas the Bardings and Wood-men speak a similar language to the men of\nRohan in terms of gross language group, as seen in Old Norse names (akin\nto Old English and Norse being in the same language group), i.e. the\nname “Brand” translating to “torch”. The language was not similar to\nDwarvish; rather the Dwarf names appearing in _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord\nof the Rings_ are Dwarf names given in the language of the Men of Dale,\nnot the native Dwarf language.  They never shared languages with the\nElves or with their Western, Southern, and Eastern counterparts; other\nthan Westron. de:Nordmenschen it:Uomini del Nord ru:Северяне"

Valarin was\ndeveloped as part of their assumption of physical forms. History\nHowever, the Elves found Valarin alien, sometimes unpleasant, with very\nfew of them ever deigning to learn the language. Some Valarin words were\nadopted by the Elves as part of the growing Quenya lexicon, particularly\nby the Vanyar. The Valar learnt Quenya instead to converse with the\nElves or with each other if Elves were present. It was not just the\nElves who borrowed from Valarin. When Melkor and Sauron devised the\nBlack Speech, at least one word, NAZG (ring) was borrowed from the\nValarin equivalent (NAŠKAD). As Ainur, both Melkor and Sauron would have\nspoken Valarin. Valarin bears no relation to any of the other Languages\nof Middle-earth as it arose beyond Arda. Little is known of it, save a\nfew words (mainly proper names) although it seems that Valarin used\nlengthy constructions. The Valarin word for Telperion is, for example,\nIbrîniðilpathânezel, which is eight syllables long. The only language\nbefore Valarin was the Music of the Ainur, the purest form of language\nas it was thought itself with a self-sufficient structure. Eru Ilúvatar\nonly showed the Ainur their music in a different form by adding the\nfinal note to their song: Eä, “_Be_”.

Their first\nindependent King was Meneldil, the nephew of Isildur, whose line ruled\nover Gondor for more than two thousand years. Unlike their cousins in\nthe North, the Dúnedain of the South maintained their realm even after\nthe loss of its Kings, and it survived under the rule of the Stewards\nuntil the time of the War of the Ring, when the Kingship was restored.\nDescription and Historical accounts Being mostly of Númenórean stock and\nruled by exiled Númenórean overlords, the Men of Gondor continued most\nof the customs and traditions of Númenór. However, over the centuries,\nthey mixed more and more with the men of Middle-earth. One of these\npeoples was the Northmen who lived in Rhovanion, and Gondor, ever\nneeding allies, began acquainting themselves with these men by the mid\nThird Age. Brave and valiant, but by the standards of the Dúnedain\nshorter lived, the Northmen gradually had more and more to do with\nGondor, and one of its heirs to the throne, Valacar, who lived and\nworked with them in their own land as an ambassador, married one of\ntheir noble ladies, setting the stages for the Kin-strife. Over the next\nfew hundred years afterward, war, rebellion, and plague severally\nweakened the blood of the Dúnedain in Gondor. Their rulers though\nsurvived and retained many of the ancient customs. As the centuries\nrolled on into the late Third Age, the Men of Gondor accustomed to war\nand invasion became a hardy and stern people more likened to\nMiddle-earth. They became summed up in the phrase, “when heads are at a\nloss, bodies must serve.” By the time of just before War of the Ring,\nthe Men of Gondor grappled constantly with the forces of Mordor giving\nand regaining ground to the Dark Lord's armies. Their leader Denethor II\ncould foresee nothing but a victory in single combat on the battlefield\nagainst him or total doom, so when it became clear that Sauron's lost\nRing of Power had been found, he and people like his son and others\nwanted the Ring to be taken by Gondor and be used against the enemy as a\nweapon. The Men of Gondor were spared the folly of this choice when\nDenethor's youngest son Faramir let Frodo and Sam continue to Mount Doom\nto destroy the One Ring. After the war was won and Aragorn II Elessar\nwas crowned, the Men of Gondor were rekindled with the ancient tradition\nof the Dúnedain of old when Elendil founded the Two Kingdoms with his\ntwo sons: Isildur and Anárion.

To their\nsouth lived the far more numerous Harfoots, and far south in the Gladden\nFields lived the Stoors. The Fallohides were fair of skin and hair, and\nnone of them ever grew a beard.

Before that time, Sauron\nhad been secretly living in the stronghold Dol Guldur in Mirkwood, and\nfrom there he had directed numerous attacks against Gondor and Arnor. In\n2060, Gandalf and others of the Wise began to suspect that the evil\npresence in Dol Guldur was Sauron. Gandalf went to Dol Guldur to\ninvestigate in 2063 and Sauron fled into the East, around Rhûn. History\nDuring the Watchful Peace, Gondor was free from attacks by Sauron's\nminions so it strengthened its borders while keeping a watchful eye on\nthe east, as Minas Morgul - where the Nazgûl nevertheless remained quiet\n- was still a threat on their flank and Mordor was still occupied\nby Orcs. The Dúnedain of the North also had peace for a time. Over the\ncourse of four centuries, Gondor's defenses began to relax. The forts\nalong the Anduin guarding Gondor's eastern front were neglected. In the\nwest, garrisons were no longer maintained at Isengard and the Glittering\nCaves - two strongholds guarding the gap between the Misty Mountains and\nthe White Mountains. In the north, Arnor had been conquered long before,\nbut the Hobbits of the Shire prospered, getting their first Took Thain\nand colonizing Buckland. Sauron, however, was not idle in the east: he\ncreated a strong alliance between the various tribes of Easterlings, so\nthat when he returned he was more powerful than before and had many Men\nin his service. Sauron returned to Dol Guldur in TA 2460 and the\nWatchful Peace ended. Evil creatures had already begun to trouble the\nnorth, while attacks on Gondor resumed soon afterwards. In TA 2475,\nIthilien was invaded by Uruks from Mordor. Around 2480, Orcs repopulated\nMoria and other strongholds in the Misty Mountains. In 2510, Men from\nRhûn called the Balchoth, successors to the Wainriders, took advantage\nof the lightly guarded forts along the Anduin and crossed the river en\nmasse. Only the coming of the Éothéod led by Eorl helped Gondor defeat\nthe Balchoth in the Battle of the Field of Celebrant.

History The Aelin-uial was the maze of lakes and fens which\nformed where the river called Aros met Sirion, before it fell beneath\nthe Andram. These were lands heavy with enchantment, both from the\ngirdle of Melian guarding Doriath to the North, but also from the power\nof Ulmo that was very mighty in the waters of the river Sirion. The\nAelin-uial was under the total control of the Sindarin kingdom of\nDoriath. The march wardens of Thingol had secret ferries among the\nreeds, so that they could cross between the Sirion's eastern and western\nbanks unseen. At the southern end of the Aelin-Uial, the Sirion's waters\ncollected together once more from the many paths they took through the\nMarshland and, at the place called the Falls of Sirion, fell a very loud\nwaterfall down into the earth.

    "text": "A FAIRY TALE is a story featuring folkloric characters such as fairies,\ngoblins, elves, trolls, giants, and others. The fairy tale is a\nsub-class of the folktale. These stories often involve princes and\nprincesses, and modern versions usually have a happy ending. In cultures\nwhere demons and witches are perceived as real, fairy tales may merge\ninto legendary narratives, where the context is perceived by teller and\nhearers as having historical actuality. However unlike legends and epics\nthey usually do not contain more than superficial references to religion\nand actual places, persons, and events. Although these allusions are\noften critical in understanding the origins of these fanciful stories.\nMany people, including Angela Carter in her introduction to the _Virago\nBook of Fairy Tales_ have noted that a great deal of so-called fairy\ntales do not feature fairies at all. This is partly because of the\nhistory of the English term “fairy tale” which derives from the French\nphrase _contes de fée_ which was first used in the collection of Madame\nD'Aulnoy in 1697. As Stith Thompson and Carter herself point out,\ntalking animals and the presence of magic seem to be more common to the\nfairy tale than fairies themselves. Some folklorists prefer to use the\nGerman term _Märchen_ to refer to fairy tales, a practice given weight\nby the definition of Stith Thompson in his 1977 edition of _The\nFolktale_: “a tale of some length involving a succession of motifs or\nepisodes. It moves in an unreal world without definite locality or\ndefinite creatures and is filled with the marvelous. In this never-never\nland humble heroes kill adversaries, succeed to kingdoms and marry\nprincesses.” (Thompson: 8) History Although in the late nineteenth and\ntwentieth century the fairy tale came to be associated with children's\nliterature, adults were originally as likely as children to be the\naudience of the fairy tale. The fairy tale was part of an oral\ntradition: tales were narrated orally, rather than written down, and\nhanded down from generation to generation. The tales often had sad\nendings; such was the penalty for dealing with the fairy folk. Later\nfairy tales were about princes and princesses, combat, adventure,\nsociety, and romance. Fairies had a secondary role. Moral lessons and\nhappy endings were more common, and the villain was usually punished. In\nthe modern era, fairy tales were altered, usually with violence removed,\nso they could be read to children (who according to a common modern\nsentiment should not hear about violence). Sometimes fairy tales are\nsimply miraculous entertainments, but often they are disguised morality\ntales. This is true for the Brothers Grimm _Kinder- und Hausmärchen_,\nand much of the drily witty, dead-pan, social criticism beneath the\nsurface of Hans Christian Andersen's tales, which influenced Roald Dahl.\nThe fairy tale has ancient roots, older than the “Arabian Nights”\ncollection of magical tales, in antiquity: Cupid and Psyche, Bel and the\nDragon. Fairy tales resurfaced in literature in the 17th century, with\nthe Neapolitan tales of Giambattista Basile and the later _Contes_ of\nCharles Perrault, who fixed the forms of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.\nAn extensive collection of European fairy tales were published by Andrew\nLang in a series of books: _The Red Fairy Book_, _The Orange Fairy\nBook_, and so forth. These provide some excellent examples of the genre.\nAccording to a 2004 poll of 1,200 children by UCI Cinemas, the most\npopular fairy tales (in the USA?) are: 1. Cinderella 2. Sleeping Beauty\n3. Hansel and Gretel 4. Rapunzel 5. Little Red Riding Hood 6. Town\nMusicians In addition, the _Arabian Nights_ stories like _Aladdin and\nhis Wonderful Lamp_ and _wikipedia:Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves_ are\noften thought to be fairy tales themselves. Contemporary fairy tales In\ncontemporary literature, many authors have used the form of fairy tales\nfor various reasons, such as examining the human condition from the\nsimple framework a fairytale provides. Some authors seek to recreate a\nsense of the fantastic in a contemporary discourse. Sometimes,\nespecially in children's literature, fairy tales are retold with a twist\nsimply for comic effect, such as _The Stinky Cheese Man_ by Jon\nScieszka. Other authors may have specific motives, such as multicultural\nor feminist reevaluations of predominantly Eurocentric masculine\ndominated fairy tales, implying critique of older narratives. The figure\nof the damsel in distress has been particularly attacked by many\nfeminist critics. Examples of narrative reversal rejecting this figure\ninclude _The Paperbag Princess_, by Robert Munsch, a picture book aimed\nat children in which a princess rescues a prince, or Angela Carter’s\n_The Bloody Chamber_, which retells a number of fairytales from a female\npoint of view. Other notable figures who have employed fairy tales\ninclude A. S. Byatt, Jane Yolen, Donald Barthelme, Robert Coover,\nMargaret Atwood, Tanith Lee, James Thurber, Kelly Link, John Bly and\nmany others. _Fairy tales are more than true -_ _not because they tell\nus dragons exist,_ _but because they tell us dragons can be beaten._  \n'G.

    "text": "The STOORS are one of the three races of Hobbits, they mostly inhabited\nswampy areas. In their earliest recorded history the Stoors, like the\nother Hobbits, lived in the Vales of Anduin. They were a riverside\npeople that dwelt in the Gladden Fields, and were fishermen. One of the\nmost infamous Stoors was Smeagol, who would later become a creature\nknown as the Gollum. Characteristics They were heavier and broader in\nbuild than the other Hobbits, and had large hands and feet. Among the\nHobbits, the Stoors most resembled Men and were most friendly to them.\nStoors were the only Hobbits who normally grew facial hair. A habit\nwhich set them apart from the Harfoots who lived in the mountain\nfoothills, and the Fallohides who lived in forests far to the north, was\nthat Stoors preferred flat lands and riversides. Only Stoors used boats,\nfished, and could swim. They also wore boots in muddy weather. Stoorish\ncharacteristics and appearances remained amongst the Hobbits of the\nEastfarthing, Buckland (such as the Brandybucks) and the Bree-hobbits\nThe Stoors also had their own dialect of Hobbitish, owing to the fact\nthat they spent some time in Dunland and adopted many strange words and\nnames which they took to the Shire, and retained even until the late\nThird Age. History The Stoors are believed to live in the southern vales\nof Anduin. During the Hobbit Wandering Days, after the Harfoots had\nmigrated westward in Third Age 1050, and the Fallohides followed them\nabout a century later, the Stoors long remained back in the vale of\nAnduin, but between T.A. 1150 and 1300 they, too migrated west. Unlike\nthe other Hobbit-kinds they took the Redhorn Pass and followed a\nsouthern route, where many Stoors branched off and moved south to the\nAngle of Eriador, south of Rivendell and mingled with the Harfoots and\nFallohides that lived there; but most went to Dunland (Swanfleet near\nTharbad) which most resembled their old lands. There they came into\ncontact with the Dunlendings. This contact altered their speech\nslightly, mostly by picking up a few Dunlending words. A hundred years\nlater Angmar began to threaten Eriador and many Stoors of the Angle fled\nsouth to their kin in Dunland where they became a woodland people;\nothers returned to Rhovanion and settled the Gladden Fields, becoming\nriverland people Déagol and Sméagol belonged to (c. T.A. 2430). There\nthey had a matriarchal society. What became of those Stoors and whether\nthey rejoined their folk in Eriador, no history tells. The Stoors of\nDunland moved back north to join the other Hobbits in colonizing the\nShire about T.A. 1630 and settled mostly in the Eastfarthing and\nSouthfarthing. The result was that places that were settled by Stoors\nhave some slight linguistic oddities due to their time of separation and\ncontact with the Dunlendings. The three original Hobbit-kinds merged and\nblended in the centuries since the settlement of the Shire, but regional\nvariations remained. Some of these villages might have survived until\nthe War of the Ring, when they were sought out by the Ringwraiths.\nHowever, most Stoors fled to the north and west, ending up in the newly\nfounded Shire around 1630. There they mingled with the Harfoots and\nFallohides, becoming the Shire-folk however they predominantly stayed in\nEastfarthing and then migrated to Buckland. Etymology Stoor is supposed\nto be a special Hobbitish word that did not exist in Westron during the\nWar of the Ring. Early English stor, stoor means “large, strong”,\nreferring to the fact that these Hobbits were of heavier build"

    "text": "The self-named '''King's Men '''hailed from Númenor. They were\nNúmenóreans who rebelled against the angelic Valar because of their\ndesire for immortality. After Númenór was consequently destroyed, those\nKing's Men who remained were known as Black Númenóreans, hostile to\nGondor. History Though the King's Men had enjoyed generations of favor\nfrom the Kings of Númenor, and no doubt helped in oppressing the\nFaithful as the Kings grew more suspicious of them, eventually a\nsupporter of the Faithful took the Sceptre once again. This King's name\nwas Tar-Palantir. He wished to return Númenor to a state of friendship\nwith the West, but the majority of the Númenóreans still clung to the\npolicies of the King's Men. Tar-Palantir's younger brother, Gimilkhâd,\nsided with his rebellious fathers, however. He took up the leadership of\nthe King's Men and stood in opposition to his brother, but generally\nkept his doings secret. It was probably to a few lords of the King's Men\nthat Sauron came to deliver some of the Nine Rings of Power, for three\nof the Nazgûl were said to be “lords of Númenórean race”. Most of the\nKing's Men living in Middle-earth Sauron and his servants assailed,\nhowever. Eventually, the last King of Númenor, Ar-Pharazôn the son of\nGimilkhâd, resolved to defeat Sauron in retaliation for this aggression,\nand he and his men sailed to Middle-earth and captured the Maia. Once in\nNúmenor, Sauron completed the corruption of the King's Men with ease,\ninciting them to worship Melkor and use the few Faithful still living in\nthe land as sacrifices. They also brutally oppressed the Men of\nMiddle-earth during this period. The corrupting power of Sauron affected\ntheir minds deeply, so that they became “quick to anger”, and hated all\nthose in the land more fortunate than them. Nor did they escape death,\nfor all sorts of sicknesses and mental afflictions assailed them, to the\npoint that they “cursed themselves in their agony”. When the Valar sent\nmessages of warning in the form of eagle-shaped clouds to them, they\nfell upon their faces in great fear, and some repented of their actions\nfor a while. In the end, however, Sauron's mastery over them was so\ncomplete that he could walk about the land “setting man against man”,\nand cause them to slay each other. At last, when Ar-Pharazôn had grown\nold and was in great fear of death, Sauron persuaded him to take a great\narmy to Aman and challenge the Valar for immortality. When he did this,\nhis army foundered in the Sea and Númenor was also destroyed. Most of\nthe King's Men thus perished in the destruction of Ar-Pharazôn's fleet\nand the Downfall of Númenor, but those who had taken up residence in\nMiddle-earth survived. When Sauron returned to Mordor, they entered into\nhis service once again, and became known as the Black Númenóreans. After\nthe Downfall For many centuries after the Downfall, these descendants of\nthe King's Men held onto the Haven of Umbar, the most northerly and\nfamous of their realms. When the surviving Faithful Numenoreans founded\nGondor and Arnor, they saw their southern counterparts as renegades,\ncalling them the Black Númenóreans. The Black Númenóreans held a similar\nhatred of Arnor and Gondor for generations. Two early Black Númenórean\nlords from the late Second Age were Herumor and Fuinur who desired power\nover men of other, lesser races, and they “rose to (great) power amongst\nthe Haradrim”, the peoples neighbouring Umbar. They likely shared\nSauron's defeat at the hands of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. The\ntriumph of the Last Alliance marked the decline of the Black Númenórean\nrace and the end of their racial superiority. They dwindled swiftly or\nbecame merged with the Middle Men. Queen Berúthiel, wife of Gondor's\nKing Tarannon Falastur was “a black Númenórean”. This was a loveless\nunion, and was presumably a political accommodation: that such\narrangements were possible implies the existence at that time of more\nGondor-friendly Black Númenóreans than the much later Mouth of Sauron. A\nBlack Númenórean elite survived at least in Umbar for over a thousand\nyears after Númenor's fall, maintaining much influence in Haradwaith. As\nlate as Third Age 1015, for example, even after being exiled from their\nhomeland for nearly a century, the lords that had been driven from Umbar\nled the Haradrim to retake Umbar. Not much is known about the Black\nNúmenóreans after their defeat by Ciryaher in T.A. 1050. A “Renegade”,\nThe Mouth of Sauron, had entered the service of Sauron in Mordor. He\nmocked the army of King Elessar in front of the Morannon.

These attempts to escape their fate actually brought death upon\nthem sooner, and the lifespans of their Kings waned. They filled the\nland of Númenor with great tombs to preserve the memory of their dead.\nIn the meantime, their everyday lives became ever more decadent: to ease\ntheir fears, they “drank and they feasted and they clad themselves in\nsilver and gold”."

Biography Mablung, along with Daeron, came to the Mereth\nAderthad bearing gifts and friendship from Doriath. He also served in\nMenegroth in some unknown position of command. Together with Beleg\nCúthalion, he was one of the great captains of the Sindar, and were the\nonly Elves of Doriath to fight with the Union of Maedhros in the\nNirnaeth Arnoediad, as King Thingol would have nothing to do with the\nwar. Mablung was was part of the Hunting of the Wolf together with King\nThingol, Beleg, Huan and Beren, who later married Lúthien. During the\nfight with the wolf, Huan is killed and Beren mortally wounded. After\nthe great beast is killed, Mablung is the one to slice open the wolf's\nbelly and retrieve the silmaril. Mablung was present when Túrin fought\nwith Saeros over his taunting and restrained Túrin's wrath to avoid a\nbrawl in the King's hall. Mablung then attempted to stop Saeros from\ntaking his threats too far and warned him of Túrin's strength, should he\nattempt to fight him. Aware that a fight had broken out between the two,\nMablung was present at the final play in the drama and tried to stop\nthings from ending badly. It was to no avail Saeros ran despairingly in\nfear and fell off a brink where a stream ran into the Esgalduin, and\nstruck his head on a rock and died. Later, Mablung was present before\nThingol's throne where he accounted for everything that had gone on\nbetween Saeros and Túrin, and later accounts of Túrin’s choice to leave\nDoriath. Mablung became captain of the guard of Doriath after Beleg left\nto seek Túrin. When Morwen Eledhwen, who dwelt in Doriath at the time,\nlearned of the fall of Nargothrond and that her son Túrin might be\nthere, she wished to seek him out. Mablung was assigned by Thingol to\nguard her on their way. Unknown to both Mablung and Morwen until too\nlate, Nienor daughter of Morwen, had joined them. Mablung was unable to\nprevent them both from being ensnared in the traps of Glaurung, the\ndragon of Morgoth. Mablung hid from Glaurung and then searched the\nsacked Nargothrond, finding no sign of Túrin.  Nienor was found again by\nMablung, in a trance, by the spell of Glaurung, at Amon Ethir. Mablung\nthen led her back to Doriath, but he later lost her again when she ran\noff unclad started by a band of Orcs; a result of the spell of Glaurung.\nThus she fled beyond the sight of Mablung. Unable to recover her Mablung\nreturned to Doriath, but he spent years afterwards searching for Morwen\nand Nienor. Mablung went to Brethil when he learned Glaurung was there,\nand there met Túrin. By admitting Nienor was lost he caused Túrin to\nrealize that Níniel his wife had actually been his sister Nienor and\nTúrin killed himself. Mablung was the last person to whom Melian spoke\nbefore departing Middle-earth. She warned him about Thingol's Silmaril\nand to send word to Beren and Lúthien. Soon after Mablung was killed\nbefore the doors of the treasury during the Sack of Menegroth by the\nDwarves of Nogrod. Etymology The name _MABLUNG_ is a Sindarin word that\nmeans _Heavy Hand_.

    "text": "The BLACK GATE, or “MORANNON”, was the gate of Udûn in\nnorthwestern Mordor, and the most fortified and direct entrance into the\nland of Mordor. Description The Black Gate was set in an impregnable\nblack stone and iron wall that stretched from the Mountains of Ash in\nthe north to the Ephel Duath in the west. The wall has been estimated to\nbe 60 feet high and 250 feet long, with each half of the great gate\nbeing 90 feet wide, and set on large stone wheels. Behind the gate were\ngigantic circular stone ramparts, and when the gate needed to be opened,\ntwo pairs of Mountain-trolls who were tethered to gigantic beams pushed\ntheir way around their rampart's track, gradually levering open the gate\nand allowing for the incoming or outgoing of Mordor's armies. Inset\nwithin the wall were myriads of archers, spearmen, bowmen, and hundreds\nof thousands of Orc troops ready to defend Mordor. The Gates themselves\nmay have been made of the same indomitable stone that constitutes\nOrthanc, so hard that even the Ents could not dent it. History It was\noriginally a gate built by Sauron the Dark Lord of Mordor in the Second\nAge, to protect and guard the northern entrance into Mordor and to\nprevent invasion at the gap between the Ash Mountains and the Ephel\nDúath. It was probably built with the help of the power of the One Ring,\nlike the Barad-dûr. After Sauron's fall after the Battle of Dagorlad, it\nbecame a garrison of the Men of Gondor. In Gondor's early days, when it\nwas building towers and cities such as Minas Ithil and Cirith Ungol\nclose to Mordor's border, it raised the two great Towers of the Teeth,\nNarchost and Carchost, which were built on either side of the wall and\nwere tall enough to overlook it. It was backed up on the other side by\nthe Isenmouthe, and protected by the castle of Durthang to the west; it\nwas redesigned to prevent anything evil from entering or leaving Mordor,\nshielding the outside from it - and it from the outside. The\nreconstruction of Minas Ithil, Tower of the Rising Moon, as well as the\nconstruction of Cirith Ungol was also done for the same purpose.\nHowever, they eventually failed and they were taken over by the servants\nof Sauron. Once taken by the Enemy, they became a monument of dread,\nfear, evil, and awe by anyone who saw the gate. Thus the Ringwraiths and\nOrcs re-entered Mordor, eventually overrunning the garrisons and\ninhabiting and taking them for their own uses. It was at this time that\nthe Nazgûl took the tower of Minas Ithil, having its name changed to\n_Minas Morgul_. During the War of the Ring, Frodo and Sam had a chance\nto go through the Black Gate when they arrived at Mordor, but it was so\nheavily fortified and guarded by the forces of Mordor that they turned\naway and were led on a different route into Mordor by Sméagol. They also\nsaw an army of Easterlings enter the gate. The Black Gate was the site\nof the last valiant battle of the War of the Ring, in the East. In March\n3019, the Army of the West commanded by Aragorn Elessar and numbering\nsome 6,000 men (plus one Elf, one Dwarf, and a Wizard and one Hobbit)\narrived at the Black Gate and challenged the many remaining armies of\nMordor. Their intention was to draw the watchful Eye of Sauron away from\nMount Doom, to allow Frodo the Ring-bearer to cast the One Ring into the\nCrack of Doom and destroy it. The delay worked and the Ring was\ndestroyed in the fires of Mount Doom, following which the Black Gate and\nthe Towers of the Teeth immediately collapsed.

The Dead\nMarshes were part of the ancient battlefield of the Battle of Dagorlad\nbetween the Last Alliance and the forces of Mordor, where many of the\nfallen were laid to rest. Over time, the battlefield became marshes,\nwhich swallowed up the dead, though their bodies could still be seen\nfloating in the water (although, according to Gollum, they are not\nphysically there, and only appear as visions). During Gondor's war with\nthe Wainriders, King Ondoher's army was caught by surprise and he and\nhis men were driven into the Dead Marshes and defeated. When Eärnil II\nbecame king, he avenged the earlier defeat at the Battle of the Camp in\nTA 1944, and the Wainriders were defeated and driven into the marshes\nwhere most perished.

They entered the Dead\nMarshes at Dawn on the 1st of March. The Passage was marked by lights\nthat danced about and candles which Gollum called “_candles of\ncorpses_”; it is likely that those who become entranced by these lights\nand attempt to touch the bodies drown in the water and go down to join\nthe dead. It seems that the bodies only appear in the water when the\nlights are lit. At the Mere of Dead Faces, Frodo became entranced by\nthese lights and tried to reach out and touch the faces of the dead at\nthe bottom of the marshes, though Sam broke him out of his trance.\nGollum told them that the dead could not be touched, suggesting that he\nhad once tried to eat them. While passing through the marshes, a Black\nRider on a Fell beast passed overhead, terrifying Gollum enough that he\nstarted to slip back into his old speech-habits, which he had somewhat\ngiven up after swearing to “serve the master of the Precious.” They\nexited the Marshes on the morning of March 2, 3019."

It was first grown among hobbits by Tobold\nHornblower in Longbottom (a region in the Shire) around S.R. 1070 (TA\n2670). Despite its foreign origins, the hobbits (possibly those in Bree)\nwere the first to use it for smoking. Pipe-weed production is a major\nindustry there, especially in the south.

Year 1 of the Shire Calendar\ncorresponded when the Shire was founded by the Bree Hobbits Marcho and\nBlanco in the year 1601 of the Third Age. Therefore, years of the Third\nAge can be converted to Shire-years by subtracting 1600. The last year\nof the Third Age was year 1421 on the Shire calendar.

The\nMid-year's Day and, when present, Overlithe had no weekday assignments.\nThis arrangement was used because it caused every day to have the same\nweekday designation from year to year (instead of changing as in the\nGregorian calendar).

These lands and features included a vast deserted\narea and further into the Deep South was a vast forested or perhaps\nareas that covered many hundreds of miles. Description The south was\nmade up of plains and bottomlands from Far Harad, Umbar, to possibly\nfurther into the south, with some hills, and along the west coast just\nbelow Umbar was a mountain range. As for vegetation, Far Harad, at least\nthe part closest to Gondor and Umbar consisted of scattered woodlands,\nand further into the south short grasslands until it ran into the\ndesert. The deep southern region consisted of vast densely forested\nareas with some hills. The climate was mostly warm and humid with parts\nof Far Harad and Umbar having mild winters, hot, dry summers with warm\nbreezes coming from the sea. The farther south had a semi-arid to an\narid climate as it proceeded into the desert regions. The deep southern\nregion’s climate was unknown but was possibly mild compared to the\nothers. Inhabitants The south is inhabited by the tribes of the Haradrim\nor Southrons, Corsairs of Umbar, and Black Númenóreans. Animal life\nincluded monstrous Oliphaunts or Mumakil, which probably came from the\nDeep South and were exploited for use in warfare and probably hard labor\nas well. These elephants and Haradrim show up in the battle for Minas\nTirith, mainly against Rohan. The population was densest in the region\nof Umbar and sparsest further into the south. The dominant language\nseemed to Westron and many of its people worshiped Sauron and the\nDarkness. History These lands existed back in the earliest days of\nMiddle-earth but seemed to be much wider and much more connected as part\nof the greater continent during the early part of the Years of the\nTrees. After the Battle of the Powers, the Great Sea (Belegaer) was\nwidened and a Great Gulf was made between the southern part of the\nBeleriand and the rest of the continent, sundering the two parts from\neach other. The south could only be reached through two land corridors:\na narrow strip that ran through the land just below the White Mountains\nwere the Nandor passed through after separating from the main host of\nthe journeying elves, and a larger corridor of land just below Cuiviénen\nand Hildórien. After the War of Wrath, the gulf between the northern\npart of the continent and the southern part was widened with the loss of\nthe Beleriand and part of the land in the south, leaving a coastal area\nthat would once be called Umbar. The inland Sea of Helcar shrunk into\nthe Sea of Rhûn and with this the south could now be approached by many\nways, barring the forces of evil that would later rule these lands.\nThroughout the Second and Third ages, the south became populated with\ntribes of Men who never really became civilized and thus were easily\nswayed by the Dark Powers and were a constant threat to the Free Peoples\nof the West. After the Fall of Númenor in the Second Age, the Black\nNúmenóreans who worshiped the Dark Powers settled there and became\nrulers of Umbar and had a great influence on the Southrons. For a time,\nthe south was ruled and influenced by the Dúnedain kingdom of Gondor but\nthat was soon lost. Pirates known as the Corsairs ruled Umbar up onto\nthe War of the Ring. The south from then on was populated by the enemies\nof the Free Peoples until pacified by King Aragorn II Elessar of the\nReunited Kingdom after the War of the Ring."

History The Isle may have been, according to legend, the\nnorthern tip of Tol Eressëa which had broken off when Ulmo ferried the\nEldar to Aman. Before the Dagor Bragollach, Turgon of Gondolin had\nprepared and organized an outpost there for which he sent ships filled\nwith messengers to Aman, to pled for aid from the Valar but none save\nfor the elf, Voronwë, who was saved by Ulmo ever returned to\nMiddle-earth. When the Falas was destroyed, the Isle of Balar became a\nrefugee camp for the survivors of the Havens of the Falas which were\nheaded by Círdan. The camps on Balar maintained close contact with the\nrefugee camp in Arvernien headed by the half-elf, Eärendil. It was on\nBalar that Círdan helped Eärendil build the ship Vingilotë, with which\nlater he sought for Valinor, to ask for the pardon of the Valar and help\nagainst Morgoth. During the War of Wrath, many Sindar and some Ñoldor\nwere still camped at the Isle of Balar, and after the war, some\nsurvivors were gathered there given the fact that they could not return\nto they homes in the Beleriand. From Balar many elves went to Lindon\nuntil the elves were summoned to return to Valinor and the Edain to the\nnewly raised isle of Númenor. Sometime after SA 32, the Isle of Balar\neventually fell beneath the Belegaer becoming one the _Lands Under the\nWave_. It had also been a place where many pearls could be found off its\nshores."

For the land\nacross the ocean to the west see the Undying Lands._ The WEST refers to\nthe large region Middle-earth and includes the lands of Beleriand (up to\nthe end of the First Age) Lindon, Eriador, Gondor, Rhovanion, and\nothers, essentially all the lands west of Rhûn and Mordor. It is also\nused to describe the Free Peoples of Middle-earth like the Elves, Men,\nDwarves, Hobbits and Ents particularly during the Third Age. West is\nnormally 'the good' versus the bad from the East. (i.e. Sauron, Harad\nand Easterlings) Description The Beleriand consisted of mostly plains\nand lowlands with scattered woodlands, dense forests, and grasslands.\nThe lands of Hithlum, Mithrim, and Dor-lómin were plateaus consisting of\nshort grasslands and scattered woodlands surrounded by mountains.\nDorthonion was mostly a plateau surrounded by a mountain range in its\nsouth and consisted of moorlands and dense forests in its north. There\nwere some hill lands such as the ones near the Blue Mountains and\nHimring. The Beleriand’s climate varied in degrees. The West Beleriand\nconsisted of cold winter, cool to mild summers in the northern part with\ncold, dry prevailing winds from the north, and warm, moist prevailing\nwinds from the sea. The southern part consisted of mild winters, mild\nsummers with warm, moist prevailing winds coming primarily from the sea.\nThe East Beleriand consisted of severe, dry winters, short, cool summers\nwith strong prevailing winds coming form the northern part near\nMorgoth’s domain. The southern part had mild winters, mild summers with\nwarm, moist prevailing winds from the sea with the exception of the\nrealms of Maedhros and Maglor between Dorthonion and the Blue Mountains,\nwhich had cold winters and mild summers due to their proximity to the\nnorth. After the fall of the Beleriand, the West’s terrain from Lindon\nto Rhovanion and Gondor was mostly lowlands and plains consisting of\nmostly shrubs, shrubs thickets and scattered woodlands. Grasslands\nprevailed in Rohan, formerly Calenardhon and dense forests were in areas\nsuch as Fangorn and Mirkwood. Hill lands were mostly in mid-Eriador,\nnext to Misty Mountains, the Wold in Rohan, and the lands east of the\nGrey Mountains. The climate variation was mostly the same as it was\nduring the First Age with severe winters and cool summers in the lands\nnear the cold north, with cold prevailing winds. Cold but milder weather\nconditions dominated northern Eriador and northern Rhovanion, and south\nfrom that mild conditions with a tendency toward fog existed throughout\nmost of the rest of Eriador and the lands to the south, with warm, moist\nprevailing winds coming from the sea. Southern Rhovanion was overall a\nbit colder then the north possibly due to its shielding from the warmer\nprevailing winds from the sea, from the Misty Mountains. Both Rohan and\nGondor were warmer climates due to their proximity to the south and the\ninfluence of the warm prevailing winds from the sea. History During the\nYears of the Trees and the First Age during the days of the Beleriand,\nthe West consisted of mostly good races which were Moriquendi elves,\nNoldorin exiles, and later Edain men with some faithful Easterlings, and\nDwarves living in the mountains. The enemy was in the North. With the\ndestruction of the Beleriend, the West became the lands of Lindon,\nEriador, Gondor, Rhovanion, and others with the East being the lands of\nRhûn and Mordor. In the Second Age, the West's population was mostly\nprimitive men and a few elves located mostly in Lindon, Eregion, and\nsome in Greenwood the Great. There were some tribes of Orcs living in\nthe Misty Mountains with some in the Grey Mountains. The enemies, Sauron\nand Easterlings mostly came from Mordor and Rhûn in the East until their\ndefeat during the War of the Last Alliance. In the Third Age, the West\nwas mostly nations of Men living in the Realms in Exile (Arnor and\nGondor). Other races such as Dwarves and Elves decreased in numbers\nbecoming hidden peoples living in realms such as: Moria, the Lonely\nMountain, Lothlórien, and Mirkwood. Hobbits, once a minor race living in\nthe Gladden Fields migrated to Bree and then The Shire, the most\npopulated of their realms. Ents diminished in numbers remained solely in\nFangorn forest. The enemies from then on were traditionally located in\nthe East, though for some time many of the threats came from within the\nWest in places such as Angmar, Misty Mountains, and Dol Guldur but\nduring the latter half of the age the enemies were solely from the East.\nThe dominant language in the West during the First Age was Elvish and\nearly Mannish and later Westron prevailed with others being used only\nregionally."

Description In the\ntime of the Two Trees of Valinor and the First Age of Arda, the\nEastlands were the location of the inland Sea of Helcar, the mountain\nrange of Orocarni (Mountains of the East), Cuiviénen, the birthplace of\nElves, and Hildórien, the birthplace of Men in the first year of the\nsun. After the destruction of Beleriand, the shape of the region changed\nconsiderably becoming more of dried land consisting of scattered\nwoodlands and lowlands. The Sea of Helcar disappeared, possibly\nshrinking into the smaller Sea of Rhûn, Cuiviénen merged with the land\nand was no longer along the coast, Hildórien still bordered the East Sea\nto its east; however, both of these realms were probably no longer\ninhabited as they once were. The Orocarni Mountains still remained\nintact and unbroken. History The Elves and Dwarves (in the mountains)\nwere the first to inhabit the East and still continued to do so even\nafter many Elves left on the Great Journey to Valinor. Later during the\nFirst Age, Men inhabited the land and quickly spread into the west but\nonly the tribes of the Edain moved into the Beleriand escaping the Dark\nPowers, while the earlier Easterling tribes stayed and continued to\nserve them. Throughout the Second and Third ages, the region still\ncontinued to be inhabited by the Easterlings who completely dominated\nthe area and still served the Dark Powers. The Easterlings also\nsometimes refer to their land as the Land of the Rising Sun. Dwarves\nprobably still lived in the Orocarni mountain range as well as other men\nand creatures. The Blue Wizards - Pallando and Alatar were said to have\ngone out there in wagons, but never returned. However, Tolkien never\nexpanded much on this area. Generally, throughout the three ages of\nMiddle-earth the east has often been the source of those who served\nMorgoth and Sauron and other enemies of the Free Peoples."

    "text": "The _EPESSË_ is one of the three categories of Elven names, equivalent\nto a nickname or honorary title. Elves were typically given two names\n(_essi_) at birth: a father-name and a mother-name. The _father-name_ is\noften based on the father's own name or (in later times) was derived\nfrom old legends. A father-name may actually be the same as the\nfather's, with a suffix added, such is the case with Gildor Inglorion. A\n_mother-name_ is given later at birth and had great significance, as\nElven mothers are said to hold great insight into the character of their\nchildren. It is also believed that mothers have the gift of prophecy in\nmatters concerning their children. The _epessë_ or the “after-name” is\nthe third type. The after-name is given later in life, but not\nnecessarily by their kin, as a title of admiration. In some\ncircumstances, the _epessë_ is chosen by the Elf himself or herself. An\nElf could be referred to by any of the three, but the _epessë_ typically\ntook preference. In songs and history, the _epessë_ is usually used\nrather than the _essi_. Examples - MAEDHROS, the oldest son of Fëanor,\nwas by his brothers referred to as _RUSSANDOL_ (copper-top): an _epessë_\nhe had earned because of his ruddy hair. _Maedhros_ itself was an\n_epessë_: his father-name had been _Nelyafinwë_ (Finwë the third:\nFëanor's own father name had been (Curu)finwë), and his mother-name\n_Maitimo_.   - _GIL-GALAD_ (Star of Radiance) is the mother-name of\n_Rodnor_, son of Orodreth. He is given the epessë _Ereinion_ because of\nhis heritage: the name literally means “Scion of Kings”.   - _CÍRDAN_ is\nthe _epessë_ of a Telerin Elf who remained in Beleriand, and later\nLindon, until the end of the Third Age. His original name had been\nforgotten, and he was referred to always as Círdan, a title that had\nbeen given to him as Lord of the Falas before the First Age.   - FINROD\nFELAGUND is usually referred to as _Felagund_ (hewer of caves), an\noriginal derogatory nickname given to him because of his dwellings at\nNargothrond. Finrod adopted the name, and made it a title of honour.   -\n_GALADRIEL_ is the Sindarin translation of Alatáriel, the latter being\nthe Telerin _epessë_ originally given to her by Celeborn. _Galadriel_\nmeans “Maiden Crowned by a Radiant Garland”. The name itself is an\n_epessë_: her father-name is Artanis (_noble woman_) and her mother-name\nis Nerwen (_man-maiden_). de:Epesse pl:Epessë sk:Epessë"

In the Naith of Lórien, the heart of the\nSilvan Elven realm, it was built in the middle of, on top of, and out of\nthe Mallorn trees that Galadriel have received from Tar-Aldarion, the\nseventh High King of Númenor, and was thenceforth the residence of\nCeleborn and Galadriel. Description Caras Galadhon is circular in shape\nand about three-thousand feet from east to west and was surrounded by a\nwall of green earth and a ditch or a moat called the Deep Fosse. On the\nwestern border, a long stone road outside the Deep Fosse ran for many\ndozens of miles also surrounded the city. The only entrance was in the\nsouth through a set of Great Gates across a bridge in the Deep Fosse.\nThe city was a host of Mallorn trees where the elves lived in flets a\ntop the trees. Located in the city's center, atop the largest Mallorn in\nthe city, was the flet of Celeborn and Galadriel and the Chamber of\nCeleborn. Other notable features were Galadriel’s garden and her mirror\nboth in the southeast quarter. History The building of the city was\nprobably started by the Silvan-speaking Nandor elves who first settled\nthe forest area of Lórien during the Time of the Trees under the light\nof stars, and was no doubt completed and/or added to throughout the ages\nby the city's later Sindarin lords. No doubt beautiful during the days\nof Amdír and his son Amroth, it was their successors' Celeborn and his\nwife Galadriel that made the city into a blissful but rather isolated\nElven haven. During the events of the War of the Ring, the Fellowship of\nthe Ring was brought through Lórien to Caras Galadhon, and there met the\nlords of the Galadhrim. Around the time of the siege of Minas Tirith\nLorien was besieged itself by Dol Guldur, three times. During the Fourth\nAge, after Galadriel had left Lórien, Caras Galadhon was ruled by a\nlonely Celeborn as capital of a Lórien which now spanned both sides of\nthe river Anduin, but at some point during the age he left for Valinor\nas well, and Caras Galadhon slowly became depopulated. It is unclear\njust how this came about since most of Lórien's people were Silvan Elves\nand, presumably, not necessarily inclined to leave Middle-earth so soon\nafter Sauron's fall; there are different references to the Fate of the\nElves of Middle-earth scattered throughout Tolkien's published works.\nCaras Galadhon is called a “great city” in the Lord of the Rings, and\nthe impression is that its population numbered in the thousands.\nHowever, the “Tale of Aragorn and Arwen” in Appendix A depicts Caras\nGaladhon as wholly abandoned by the time of Aragorn II Elessar's death.\nEtymology The name _CARAS GALADHON_ means “Fortress of Trees”: from the\nSilvan _caras_ (“fortress”) and _galadhon_ (“of trees”). It may also be\ntranslated as “Fortress of Galadhon”. _Galadhon_ may be referred to\nCeleborn's father, Galadhon.

This battle took the lives of most of the\nGondolindrim, and of Turgon and his captains. However, some few managed\nto escape the through a secret passage, notably Tuor, Idril, and their\nson Eärendil. History When the Ñoldor cities of Beleriand fell to the\nwrath of Morgoth one by one, Gondolin, hidden within the Crissaegrim,\nremained as the last bastion of hope for those who opposed him. But in\nFA 551, Turgon's nephew, Maeglin, secretly lusting after his cousin\nIdril and afterwards, failing to receive her love, divulged the secrets\nof Gondolin and its passes to Morgoth, who then orchestrated the assault\nfor many years before finally unleashing his armies upon the unprepared\nElves. Due to information passed by Maeglin, Morgoth's forces managed to\nsurround the city without being detected, coming over the Encircling\nMountains at the point where the watch was least vigilant and during a\ntime of festival. By the time the Elves became aware of them, the city\nwas under siege, and there was no hope of victory or escape on the part\nof the defenders. For many days the Elves of Gondolin held their ranks\nand the city. The battles that raged beneath its walls were bloody and\nterrible - courageous leaders and warriors, most predominantly Ecthelion\nand Tuor, became legends, and later songs and epic poems would be\nwritten about them. Swords such as Orcrist and Glamdring earned their\nreputations here, and became feared among orcs. However, Morgoth's\narmies were too numerous and powerful for the Elves to overcome, as they\nwere comprised not only of Orcs and other mundane Dark creatures, but of\nBalrogs and an entire brood of Dragons fathered by Glaurung. The\ndefenders of the city managed to leave their mark on the attackers,\nslaying at least two Balrogs, one of whom was Gothmog himself, but\nultimately, the battle was a complete and decisive victory for Morgoth.\nWith Gondolin's fall, the last of the great Elven kingdoms in\nMiddle-earth was destroyed, and with it was destroyed any terrestrial\nhope of resisting Morgoth's power. Canon The Fall of Gondolin is the\nthird of the Great Tales, but was the first written by Tolkien, and is\nthe second most complete of the tales (after The Children of Húrin, and\nis less fractured than the materials used to make up Beren and Lúthien\n(2017) as stand alone and 'continuous' as possible). The sources for\nthis major First Age event are the chapters “THE FALL OF GONDOLIN” of\n''The Book of Lost Tales Part Two __ ''and “OF TUOR AND THE FALL OF\nGONDOLIN” in _The Silmarillion_, which both tell of the founding of the\nElven city of Gondolin (built in secret by Turgon and his people), of\nthe arrival Tuor, a prince of the Edain, of the betrayal of the city to\nMorgoth by Turgon's nephew Maeglin, and of its subsequent destruction by\nMorgoth's armies. There is also an unpublished poem: _The Lay of the\nFall of Gondolin_ The _Lost Tales_ chapter goes more in depth than the\naccount in _The Silmarillion_, telling notably in detail of Tuor's and\nEcthelion's feats in battle, and mentioning every captain of the Houses\nof the Gondolindrim. Background J.R.R. Tolkien actually began writing\nthe story that would become “The Fall of Gondolin” in 1917, in an army\nbarracks on the back of a sheet of military marching music. It is more\nor less the first traceable story he ever wrote down on paper about the\nMiddle-earth legendarium. Because Tolkien was constantly revising his\nFirst Age stories, the narrative he wrote in 1917 (published\nposthumously in _The Book of Lost Tales Part Two_) remains the only full\naccount of the fall of the city. The narrative in _The Silmarillion_ was\nthe result of the editing by his son Christopher of various different\nsources. A partial new version of “The Fall of Gondolin” was published\nin the _Unfinished Tales_ under the title “Of Tuor and his Coming to\nGondolin”. Actually titled “Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin”, this\nnarrative shows a great expansion of the earlier tale. It can be\nsurmised from this text that Tolkien would have rewritten the entire\nstory, but for reasons that are not known he abandoned the text before\nTuor actually arrives in the city. For this reason Christopher Tolkien\nretitled the story before including it in _Unfinished Tales_.",

When Lord Aragorn entered the city,\nPeregrin persisted in crudely referring to Aragorn by the nickname he\nhad garnered as a Ranger of the North: “Strider”, even in front of\nforeign dignitaries such as King Éomer of Rohan. Aragorn was amused, and\ndecided that the name of the lineage he founded would be “Telcontar”,\nwhich translates as “Strider” in Quenya. Members of the House of\nTelcontar are referred to as the “Telcontari”, because Telcontari\n(Striders) is the plural of Telcontar in Quenya. Aragorn then took the\nroyal name “Elessar”. With Queen Arwen, King Elessar reigned for 120\nyears, before finally surrendering his life. This long reign is\nattributed to Elessar's descent from the Men of Númenor, who are blessed\nwith long life (he was 87 when he took the throne). He rebuilt the old\ncapital Annúminas in Arnor and later ruled from this northern capital,\nalthough the old capital Minas Tirith was still of great political\nimportance. Elessar had one known son, Eldarion, and an unspecified\nnumber of daughters. King Elessar was buried with higher honor in Minas\nTirith. King Eldarion (his name meaning “From the Elves” in reference to\nhis mother Arwen) was “full ripe for kingship” at the time, and ruled\nfor an unspecified amount of time well into the Fourth Age of Men.\nLittle is known of Eldarion, save that he left heirs to continue the\nHouse of Telcontar after him. de:Telcontar it:Casa di Telcontar"

In The Fellowship Of The Ring it is\ndescribed as following: “its waters were dark: a deep blue like clear\nevening sky seen from a lamp-lit room. Its face was still and unruffled.\nAbout it lay a smooth sward, shelving down on all sides to its bare\numbroken rim.” Geography The lake lay less than a mile east and a little\nbelow the Great Gates of Moria. It was long and oval, shaped like a\ngreat spear-head thrust deep into the northern glen of the vale. Its\nwaters were dark: a deep blue like clear evening sky and there was a\nsmooth sward of grass around its rim. History In the First Age, Durin\nthe oldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves wandered into Azanulbizar\nvale and beheld in a small, still lake a reflection of himself bearing a\ncrown of seven stars. The stars were the constellation Durin's Crown\nwhich the elves call Valacirca and men call the Big Bear. Because of\nthis sign Durin chose to build his great hall Moria in the mountains\nabove that vale. The name Kheled-zâram is in Khuzdul and means\n“Glass-lake”. In Westron it was called MIRRORMERE, it is probably so\nnamed because the waters of the lake were always smooth and the stars\ncould always be seen reflected in its surface no matter the time of day.\nOnly Durin, however, could see his own reflection. The Dwarves of\nDurin's Folk regarded this site as sacred and built a monument there. It\nwas a single stone column called Durin's Stone, standing by the\nroadside. After Moria was abandoned it fell into disrepair, and in the\nlast years of the Third Age it was cracked, weather-worn, and broken at\nthe top.

The finest of these pieces was\nthe Nauglamír. The Nauglamír was the second-greatest treasure of\nDoriath, prized above all but Beren and Lúthien's Silmaril. After the\nsmiths of Belegost finished their work on the Nauglamír, Thingol\nrequested that the Dwarves of Nogrod set the Silmaril in it. The\nNauglamír, now bearing the Silmaril was held to be the fairest object in\nArda. Enthralled by its beauty and greedy for the Silmaril, the dwarves\ndemanded the necklace insisting that as dwarf work it belonged to them.\nThingol was unwilling to surrender the treasure and replies with an\nimpertinent answer. In their anger, the Dwarves slew him. Two escaped to\nNogrod and told a much different story to their kinsmen, persuading the\ncity to march on Doriath. After the Fall of Doriath, the Dwarves of\nNogrod marched homewards with the stolen Nauglamír and the rest of the\ntreasures of that land but Beren, at the head of an army of Laiquendi\nand Ents slew the dwarves. The treasure was cast into the Ascar save the\nNauglamír, which Beren gave to Lúthien. After Beren and Lúthien's final\ndeaths, the necklace was inherited by their son, Dior, who became the\nsecond King of Doriath. When the Sons of Fëanor heard that the inheritor\nof the throne of Doriath, they demanded that he surrender it to them or\nbecome their enemy. When he refused, this brought about the Second\nKinslaying as the Sons of Fëanor, seeking the Silmaril in accordance\nwith the Oath of Fëanor, attacked Doriath. Dior's daughter, Elwing,\nescaped the kinslaying with the Nauglamír, fleeing to the Mouths of\nSirion. In the Third Kinslaying, the Sons of Fëanor attacked the Elven\nhavens in the Mouths of Sirion, still trying to obtain the Silmaril\nwithin the Nauglamír but Elwing cast herself into the sea with it rather\nthan surrender the gem to Maedhros and Maglor. The Nauglamír was lost,\nwhile Elwing and the Silmaril were saved by the Vala Ulmo. Other\nversions of the legendarium In an earlier myth of First Age lore that\npreceded the final stories in _The Silmarillion_, namely the Lost Tale\n_The Nauglafring_, the Nauglamír (named the NAUGLAFRING) is more\nimportant: the necklace becomes caught behind a tree branch when Thingol\nis riding outside the Girdle of Melian and is attacked by the Dwarves.\nThingol is unhorsed and slain. Following this, Melian's protection is\nlifted and Doriath is sacked."

It\nwas published after Tolkien's death in _The Lays of Beleriand_, the 3rd\nvolume of _The History of Middle-earth_. The battle of Felagund and\nSauron in songs of power is a poem from the Lay of Leithian, published\nin _The Silmarillion_: He chanted a song of wizardry, Of piercing,\nopening, of treachery, Revealing, uncovering, betraying. Then sudden\nFelagund there swaying Sang in answer a song of staying,  Resisting,\nbattling against power, Of secrets kept, strength like a tower, And\ntrust unbroken, freedom, escape; Of changing and of shifting shape, Of\nsnares eluded, broken traps, The prison opening, the chain that snaps.\nBackwards and forwards swayed their song. Reeling and foundering, as\never more strong The chanting swelled, Felagund fought, And all the\nmagic and might he brought Of Elvenesse into his words. Softly in the\ngloom they heard the birds Singing afar in Nargothrond, The sighing of\nthe sea beyond, Beyond the western world, on sand, On sand of pearls in\nElvenland. Then the gloom gathered; darkness growing In Valinor, the red\nblood flowing Beside the Sea, where the Noldor slew The Foamriders, and\nstealing drew Their white ships with their white sails From lamplit\nhavens. The wind wails, The wolf howls. The ravens flee. The ice mutters\nin the mouths of the Sea. The captives sad in Angband mourn. Thunder\nrumbles, the fires burn-- And Finrod fell before the throne."

Significance to the Children of Ilúvatar Elves seemed to be\nthe only ones fond of forests, particularly the Avarian and Nandorian\nelves that settled in them and stayed in their bounds. Men and Dwarves\nseemed to prefer living in walled cities and towns or underground, and\ngenerally cut down trees for their metallurgical work, usually in\nmoderation. A few exceptions include the early Fallohides living in the\nforested areas near the Misty Mountains and the Drúedain living in the\nforest of the same name. Orcs and other evil creatures generally hated\nforests and usually hewed them down without pity nor respect to fuel\ntheir warmongering.

During the Years of the Trees when the Valar\nremoved to Aman, the first real and dense forests arose and spread\nthroughout Middle-earth in parts of the Beleriand, in Eriador where a\nvast forest reigned for many thousands of years, and some in the land of\nRhovanion where Greenwood stood. The vast lands of the south of\nMiddle-earth and much of the Dark Land where very few people lived also\nhad many dense forested areas. All forests in the Beleriand perished\nwith its destruction at the end of the First Age. Second Age The vast\nprimordial forests in Eriador stood until the middle of this age when\nthe Númenóreans began cutting them down to built their fleets and fuel\ntheir desire for empire and dominion. Then when Sauron declared war in\nSA 1693 much of the forested area in Eriador was burned to the ground or\nextensively damaged. Third Age By the Third Age all that remained of the\nvast forests of Eriador were Fangorn forest and the Old Forest both of\nwhich were guarded by the Ents and Tom Bombadil.

History Lammoth was the land\nof “the Great Echo”, and it was so named because it was where Morgoth\nand Ungoliant fled after the darkening of Valinor and Morgoth's theft of\nthe Silmarils. Ungoliant, who greatly thirsted for the Silmarils\ndemanded them from Morgoth, and when he refused to give them to her she\nattacked Morgoth in order to get them. Weakened by the power that had\ngone out of him, he let out a great cry which echoed throughout the\nnorth of Middle-earth, and there and ever after the echo of his great\ncry lingered until the end of the Beleriand. _“Ungoliant had grown\ngreat, and less by the power that had gone out of him; and she rose\nagainst him...Then Morgoth sent forth a terrible cry, that echoed in the\nmountains. Therefore that region was called Lammoth, for the echoes of\nhis voice dwelt there ever after, so that any who cried aloud in that\nland awoke them, all the waste between the hills and the sea was filled\nwith a claumour as of voices in anguish. The cry of Morgoth in that hour\nwas the greatest and most dreadful that was ever heard in the northern\nworld.”_ The echo of so many voices in Lammoth traveled into North\nalerting Morgoth to the arrival of the host of Fëanor in Middle-earth,\nsending and great host against him in Mithrim starting the\nDagor-nuin-Giliath. Other versions of the legendarium In _Of Tuor and\nhis Coming to Gondolin_ the name instead refers to the acoustic\nproperties of the location and the natural reverberations they cause.\nWhen Fëanor landed there in the First Age, _“the voices of his host were\nswelled to a mighty clamour”_ by the Echoing Mountains.

    "text": "The MALLORN (pl. _MELLYRN_) was a kind of large tree that throughout\nhistory only grew in Aman, Númenor, Lindon, and Lórien in the Eastern\nlands of Middle-earth. Description Mellyrn were similar to beech trees\nin that their bark was smooth and silver-grey, but their leaves, which\nwere green above and silver beneath, were much larger and longer than\nbeech trees, and turned a clear gold in autumn. The golden leaves did\nnot fall like other deciduous trees, but remained on the tree throughout\nthe winter, only falling in the spring, when golden flowers bloomed on\nthe branches and new leaves sprouted, turning the entire forest a bright\ngold. There is the sense that mallorn trees were more alive or had a\ngreater presence than other trees. Frodo Baggins explained that he could\nfeel the “life of the tree” when he touched a mallorn in Lothlórien.\nHistory Mallorn-trees originally grew on Tol Eressëa, and probably also\ngrew in Valinor. The Ñoldor may have introduced mellyrn to Gondolin when\nthey came to Middle-earth, but these were all destroyed with the city.\nThe Elves of Tol Eressëa brought mallorn-trees to the Men of Númenor and\nthey grew on the shores around the Bay of Eldanna in that land. Even\nTar-Aldarion, the great Ship-King, did not cut down these trees.\nMellorn-nuts were once given by Tar-Aldarion, a Ship-King of Númenor, to\nhis friend Gil-galad, the Ñoldorin King of Lindon. The mellyrn did not\ngrow in Lindon, but Galadriel took some nuts with her to Lothlórien,\nwhere they grew to immense heights. Lothlórien became known as the\n_Golden Wood_, per its name's translation, because of them. The\nFellowship spent its first night in Lothlorien on flets (wooden\nplatforms) built onto the upper branches of several adjacent mallorn\ntrees. In this case the flets were of simple construction with light\nwoven movable walls to block the wind. These mallorn trees were on the\nNorth Eastern edge of Lothlorien, close by the tributary river of\nNimrodel or Silverlode. Caras Galadhon, the city of Galadriel and\nCeleborn within Lothlórien, was built in the branches of huge\nmallorn-trees, with a large hall built into the upper branches of the\ntallest tree at the centre of the city. The large horizontal branches of\nthe mallorn lent themselves to being used in this way. The Fellowship\nwere later given lembas the elvish waybread wrapped in mallorn-leaves.\nThe mallorn leaf wrapping helped keep the waybread fresh and helped\nsustain its capacity to keep people alive for long periods in the\nabsence of other foods. Galadriel gave Samwise Gamgee a box of soil from\nher garden containing a single silver mallorn nut. After the War of the\nRing, Sam planted the nut in the Shire, in the Party Field where\nthe Party Tree had stood. From the nut grew a new Mallorn-tree that\nbecame the new party tree. It was the only mallorn-tree in Middle-earth\noutside of Lórien. When the tree bloomed the next spring and summer it\nbecame the wonder of the neighbourhood and in time a place of\npilgrimage; an image of times long past and a thing of beauty and\nwonder. . Symbolically, this specific tree acts as the living sign of\nthe special blessing and thanks which the Shire receives for the efforts\nof Frodo, Samwise, Meriadoc and Peregrin in the struggle against Sauron\nand Saruman; as well as a nod to the essential and simple good qualities\nof the hobbit people and their close relationship to their lands.\nEtymology The name is derived from the Sindarin terms _malt_ (“gold”)\nand _orn_ (“tree”). MALINORNË is the Quenya name for Mallorn."

So that the people of Gondor in times of\npeace, justice and prosperity, would become discontented and restless —\nwhile the dynasts descended from Aragorn would become just kings and\ngovernors — like Denethor or worse. I found that even so early there was\nan outcrop of revolutionary plots, about a centre of secret Satanistic\nreligion; while Gondorian boys were playing at being Orcs and going\naround doing damage. I could have written a 'thriller' about the plot\nand its discovery and overthrow — but it would have been just that. Not\nworth doing._” ―from _The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien_, Letter to Colin\nBailey"

Upon the lake's northern\napproach from Anduin the Men of Gondor constructed the huge pillars of\nthe Argonath in the reign of Rómendacil II to mark the northern boundary\nof their realm, although by the time of the War of the Ring that\nboundary has long since receded. At the southern end of the lake stand\nthree hills. Amon Hen was the location of Seat of Seeing, stands upon\nthe western shore and Amon Lhaw, the Seat of Hearing upon the east. The\nthird hill forms an island in the lake itself, Tol Brandir. None has\never set foot upon the island due to the intense currents at the lake's\nsouth end, for the lake is drained by the Falls of Rauros.

They differed from normal dwarves in various ways: they were\nsmaller, far more unsociable, and they freely gave away their names;\nother dwarves kept their Khuzdul names and language a secret. History\nThe Petty-dwarves were dwarves of several houses, which had been exiled\nfor reasons unknown in very ancient times during the Peace of Arda. They\nwere the first to cross the Blue Mountains (Ered Luin) in the First Age,\nand established strongholds in Beleriand before the building of Nogrod\nand Belegost in the Blue Mountains, and before the elves arrived. They\ndelved the very ancient settlements of Nulukkizdin (Nargothrond) and\nAmon Rûdh but they dwindled before the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth.\nThe Sindar, not yet acquainted with dwarves, thought the Petty-dwarves\nwere animals, and hunted them. Not until the dwarves of the Ered Luin\nestablished contact with the Sindar did the latter realize what the\nPetty-dwarves were. Afterwards they were mostly left alone, but not\nbefore the Petty-dwarves came to hate all elves with a passion. By the\ntime of the War of the Jewels, after the Return of the Ñoldor, the\nPetty-dwarves had nearly died out. By the fifth Century of the First\nAge, the last remnant of their people were Mîm and his two sons, who\nlived at Amon Rûdh. Túrin and his men shot at the dwarves, mistaking\nthem for animals or orcs. Mim survived, but an arrow had killed one of\nhis sons, Khîm. Mim's other son had been killed by orcs, leaving Mim the\nlast of his kind. Mîm was killed by Húrin after the latter's release\nfrom Angband, and the Petty-dwarves were no more. Origin in Tolkien's\nwritings The Petty-dwarves were created from remnant ideas based on the\nNauglath in Tolkien's earliest writings in the _The Book of Lost Tales_.\nThey were more or less created to explain the difference between the\ndwarves later writings such as The Hobbit in comparison to the wicked\ndwarves from his earlier stories which he hadn't yet\ncompletely abandoned. However, some of the ideas of the Nauglath were\nreincorporated into the Naugrim (Dwarves) by J.R.R. Tolkien or his son\nin the published Silmarillion and separate from the Petty-dwarves (such\nas the history of Belegost and Nogrod, and the Sack of Doriath events).\n''_'Niwennog_ '''was their first ascribed name (preceding the change to\n_Nibin-noeg_), as told of in the index of _The War of the Jewels._\nes:Bar-en-Nibin-noeg it:Nanerottoli pl:Bar-en-Nibin-noeg ru:Малые гномы",

    "text": "AMON ANWAR originally EILENAER, later HALIFIRIEN (Rohirric _The Holy\nMountain_), is the location of several great events in the history of\nGondor, and was originally considered the centre of the Realm. Amon\nAnwar stood up out of a great wood around its feet. The hill was long\nand sloping and the wood went almost to the summit. While it was\nconsidered the centre of Gondor, it would be better described as the\nspiritual centre of Gondor, as it was _the high place nearest to the\ncentre of a line from the inflow of the Limlight down to the southern\ncape of Tolfalas and the distance to it was equal from the Fords of Isen\nand Minas Tirith_. History The Tomb of Elendil After the War of the Last\nAlliance, Isildur defined the bounds of Gondor and, upon discovering\nthat this was the centre of Gondor, he entombed his father Elendil here\nand it was at this time that the hill's name became AMON ANWAR, as\nIsildur had called the protection of the Valar upon that hilltop, and\nthey had granted it. Isildur swore all those present to secrecy and\nforbade anyone save an Heir of Elendil from disturbing it. The tomb then\nstayed untouched by any save the Kings of Gondor and later, their\nStewards. The Oath of Eorl In the time of the twelfth Ruling Steward,\nCirion, Gondor was faced with a massive invasion of a land they could\nnot protect, Calenardhon which had been depopulated in the Great Plague\nof 1636, though it had not been greatly populated to begin with. Cirion\ncalled upon the aid of the Éothéod and in return for their aid, he\nsurrendered Calenardhon to them, Until the Great King should return.\nAlthough by this time the lives of eleven Stewards had passed before\nhim, no one in Gondor ever expected that the King would return. Cirion\ntook Eorl, the Lord of the Éothéod to the hallowed site of AMON ANWAR\nand there before the Tomb of Elendil they swore what would be in later\ndays known as the Oath of Eorl, giving Calenardhon to the Éothéod, and\npromising eternal friendship between the two Kingdoms. As Amon Anwar was\nno longer the centre of Gondor, rather its border, Cirion removed the\nCasket that Isildur had set upon the hill two thousand years earlier to\nRath Dínen, the Silent Street, where all other Kings of Gondor were\nentombed. The Warning Beacon Amon Anwar was the seventh and last of the\nWarning beacons of Gondor which gave the final warning or message to\nRohan. It stood overlooking the Firien wood which was just outside the\nborder of Rohan near the Mering Stream. Also, chain of Warning Beacons\nwas established along the line of the White Mountains to warn South\nGondor of danger in Calenardhon, and vice-versa. Later this was used to\nwarn Anorien of Danger to Gondor and Rohan also. The westernmost and\nlast built beacon was situated upon AMON ANWAR, and was only created\nafter the Tomb of Elendil was removed to Rath Dínen, as no Lord of\nGondor, King or steward had permitted the construction of a beacon\nwhilst Elendil still remained there. Even after Elendil was removed to\nMinas Tirith, the Awe still remained upon the hill, and its surrounding\nforest. The Beacon Wardens would live close to the Summit only for short\nwatches in specially constructed cabins. Except when there was a noise\nof animals in the forest, or of folk along the road, they would find\nthemselves speaking to their companions in whispers, as if they expected\na great voice from long ago to speak. The Wardens were the only people\nto live in those woods, and were glad when their tour of duty was over.\nThe mound of Elendil's Tomb remained upon the top of the hill from the\ntime that Isildur hallowed it until the Changing of the world, always in\na well-kept, green field.

Biography Carcharoth was created as a defence against Huan,\nand was reared by Morgoth's own hands on living flesh and filled with\ngreat power. So Carcharoth, who was also named ANFAUGLIR (IPA:\n/anˈfaʊglir/), the 'Jaws of Thirst', grew to great size and his strength\nseemed beyond compare. His eyes burned like red coals and his teeth were\npoisoned as the spears of the Orcish legions. Carcharoth was the\nguardian of the gate of Angband and none could pass him by strength of\nbody alone. He became involved with the Quest for the Silmaril when\nBeren and Lúthien had to pass him on their way in. He espied them on\ntheir way in, and grew suspicious of Beren because he was disguised as\nDraugluin, who Carcharoth knew to be slain. Before he could take action\nagainst the pair, Lúthien enchanted him with her magic, sending him into\na deep sleep. Unfortunately, on their way out Carcharoth awoke, and\nLúthien was too weary to spell him again. Beren held out the captured\nSilmaril in an attempt to slay the beast, but Carcharoth was not\ndaunted, and bit off Beren's hand at the wrist, Silmaril and all. The\nSilmaril burnt away Carcharoth's insides, and he became crazed with\npain, yet filled with great power. A terror to Eldar, Men and Orcs\nalike, he burst from Angband, slaying anything and everything in his\npath. He continued south through Beleriand, and eventually he arrived in\nDoriath. With the power of the Silmaril inside him, the Girdle of Melian\nhad no effect on him, and his presence placed the entire kingdom in\ngrave danger. To protect Doriath, Beren Erchamion, Elu Thingol, Beleg\nCúthalion, and Mablung joined with Huan the Hound to track down and slay\nthe Wolf. Carcharoth was killed in single combat by Huan in FA 466, but\nboth Huan and Beren were mortally wounded by the poison in Carcharoth's\nteeth. When Mablung cut open the wolf's belly, he found there the\nSilmaril with Beren's hand still closed around it, but when he touched\nthe flesh it was swept away by a wind leaving only the great Jewel.",

    "text": "WEREWOLVES were servants of Morgoth, bred from wolves and inhabited by\ndreadful spirits (fallen lesser Maiar or the fëar of orcs) imprisoned in\nthese wolfish forms by Sauron. Unlike werewolves of other literature,\nthe werewolves of Middle-earth do not transform from man to wolf at\nnight and their behavior is not influenced by the full moon or other\nlunar cycles. They inhabited Tol-in-Gaurhoth, which became known as the\nIsle of Werewolves. History Origins The first werewolf was Draugluin at\nTol-in-Gaurhoth, and the greatest werewolf after him was Carcharoth, the\nguardian of Angband, and a descendant of Draugluin as all other\nwerewolves were. The form of the werewolves was first thought of by\nSauron, who was their lord, and took the shape of a great wolf himself\nat least once. Gandalf suggests in his talks with Frodo after the Ford\nof Bruinen that werewolves survived into the Third Age, and makes a\ndistinction between them and wargs. The latter, though, might simply be\ndescended from werewolves, as they could speak, suggesting they had fëar\n(souls). Characteristics The werewolves of Middle-earth were not\nshape-shifters, and were always in the form of great beasts. The fangs\nof Carcharoth were venomous, though it is not known if all werewolves\nhad venomous fangs. Werewolves are similar to wolves and wargs, and were\nquite large even compared to wargs. Known to be stronger and faster than\nthe famous warg race, they were also as intelligent as a mortal man,\nwhich made them capable of negotiating and communicating with others.\nThus they were able to speak the Black Speech, Westron, and the Elvish\nlanguages. Etymology The name _werewolf_ appears to have been chosen\nbecause they were in essence sapient (but evil), and thus had a status\nsimilar to men rather than beasts — the word \"_were\"_ in the word\n_werewolf_ being from the Anglo-Saxon word _were_, meaning man, so the\nterm werewolf can be translated to man-wolf. They were known by the\nElves of their time as 'gaurhoth'.",

The ban ended after the\nWar of Wrath when the Valar forgave the remaining Ñoldor. Of the leaders\nwho had led the Noldor into exile only Galadriel chose to remain, having\nwed Celeborn. On the Númenóreans After the founding of Númenor, the\nNúmenóreans were forbidden by the Valar from sailing so far westward\nthat Númenor was no longer visible, for fear that they would come upon\nthe Undying Lands, to which Men could not come.

    "page_id": "3784",
    "text": "_ON FAIRY-STORIES_ is an essay written by J. R. R. Tolkien that was\npublished as a book. Tolkien originally wrote the essay in 1939 for his\nlecture on the subject of Fairly Tales in general to an audience at\nUniversity of St. Andrews in Scotland. Afterwards, it was first\npublished within _Essays Presented to Charles Williams_ in 1947. It was\nthen subsequently published with _Leaf by Niggle_ in _Tree and Leaf_ as\nwell as in _The Tolkien Reader_, around 1966. It has since been renewed\nas an Expanded edition (pictured right), edited by Tolkien scholars\nVerlyn Flieger and Douglas Anderson, in 2008. The essay contains\nTolkien's explanation of his philosophy on fantasy and on “faerie”, and\nthoughts on the crafting of the mythos. Summary Tolkien named the genre\n_Fairy Stories,_ which he carefully distinguishes from actual “Fairy\nTales”. This distinction seems to be twofold. First, he defines _fairy\nstories_ as not stories about fairies or other supernatural beings, but\nstories about the interaction between humans and those beings. Second,\nhe emphasizes that through the use of fantasy, which he equates with\nfancy and imagination, the author can bring the reader to experience a\nworld which is consistent and rational, yet utterly strange as well. He\ncalls this “a rare achievement of Art”, and notes that it was important\nto him as a reader: “It was in fairy-stories that I first divined the\npotency of the words, and the wonder of things, such as stone, and wood,\nand iron; tree and grass; house and fire; bread and wine.” Having\ndefined the genre, Tolkien goes on to defend its utility on three\ngrounds. First, suggesting that fairy stories allow the reader to review\nhis or her own world from the “perspective” of a different world. This\nconcept, which shares much in common with cultural relativism, Tolkien\ncalls “recovery”, in the sense that one's unquestioned assumptions might\nbe recovered and changed by an outside perspective. Second, he defends\nfairy stories as offering escapist pleasure to the reader. And third,\nTolkien suggests that fairy stories (can) provide moral or emotional\nconsolation, through their happy ending, which he terms a\n“eucatastrophe”."

The book was\noriginally called “THE GREAT CAKE”, but the title was changed to “SMITH\nOF WOOTTON MAJOR” in an attempt to suggest an early work by P.G.\nWodehouse. It is not definitely connected to the Middle-earth\nlegendarium. Both _Faery_ and Valinor are lands outside of the normal\nworld, but Valinor cannot normally be visited by mortals. There are\nlesser Elven kingdoms that humans can visit and return: Faramir mentions\nvisitors to Lorien. Summary The village of Wootton Major is well-known\naround the countryside for its annual festivals, which are particularly\nfamous for their culinary delights. The biggest festival of them all is\nthe Feast of Good Children. This festival is celebrated only once every\ntwenty-four years, and the celebrations take the form of a party to\nwhich twenty-four children of the village are invited. The highpoint of\nthe party is the Great Cake, which is remarkable for its hidden magical\ningredients. Whoever swallows one of these is given the rare gift of an\nentry into the Land of Faery. This year the magic star hidden inside the\nGreat Cake was eaten by a blacksmith’s son. The boy did not feel any of\nits magical properties at once but on the morning of his tenth birthday\nthe star fixed itself on his forehead and marked him as one intimate\nwith the Faeryfolk. This boy grew up to be a blacksmith like his father,\nbut in his free time he roamed into the Land of Faery. The star on his\nforehead protected him from the evils threatening mortals in that land,\nand the Folk called him Starbrow and told him about their land and its\nhidden beauties and dangers. The years passed and it was now time for\nanother Feast of Good Children. Smith had had his precious gift for most\nof his life now and the time had come for it to be passed on to some\nother child. So he gave up the star, and the mysterious new Master Cook\nbaked it into the festive cake once more."

    "title": "Farmer Giles of Ham",
    "page_id": "3781",
    "text": "FARMER GILES OF HAM (written in 1947, published in 1949) is a short\nMiddle Earth story written by J. R. R. Tolkien. The story describes a\nseries of encounters between Farmer Giles and a wily Dragons named\nChrysophylax. It is set in a fantasy Britain of long ago, which has\nmythical creatures, medieval knights, and primitive firearms. It is\nhappily anachronistic, and is more like a folk-tale than the sweeping\nepics which Tolkien is better known for. The book was originally\nillustrated by Pauline Baynes. Plot Farmer Giles was not a hero. He was\nfat and red-bearded and enjoyed a slow, comfortable life. One day a\nrather deaf and short-sighted giant blundered on to his land. Farmer\nGiles managed to scare him away with a blunderbluss shot in its general\ndirection. The people of the village cheered: Farmer Giles was a hero.\nHis reputation spread far and wide across the kingdom. Giles was\nrewarded by the King of the Middle Kingdom, with a sword named\nCaudimordax or “Tailbiter”, a powerful weapon against dragons. The giant\nreports to its monstrous friends that there are no more knights, just\nstinging flies (actually scrap metal from Giles' blunderbuss), in the\nMiddle Kingdom. This prompts a dragon, Chrysophylax Dives, to\ninvestigate the area and everyone turns to the accidental hero Farmer\nGiles to deal with it. The story makes light of the great dragon-slaying\ntraditions. The knights who are supposed to do the job are useless fops\nmore intent on “precedence and etiquette” than on noticing huge dragon\nfootprints littering the landscape. “Giles” is also an interesting\ncommentary on how people react to danger. Heroes aren't simply called\nfor, they are demanded and hapless farmers can be forced to be heroes.\nThe Latin names and references imply that Giles is a Briton, a late\ngeneration remnant of the old empire after the decline of the western\nauthority of the Romans. All the Giles place-names are supposed to occur\nrelatively close to Oxford, along the Thames or on the route from London\nto Oxford. Among the jokes is a question put to “the four wise clerks of\nOxenford”; Tolkien then quotes from the Oxford English Dictionary, on\nwhich he had worked. The phrase “wise clerk of Oxenford” is also a\nreference to Chaucer's Clerk. “Farmer Giles of Ham” is sometimes\npublished in an omnibus edition with “Smith of Wootton Major”, another\nTolkien novella with illustrations by Pauline Baynes. It is rumored that\nfarmer Giles in really Hamwise Gamgee but it is very unlikely since\nHamwise did not believe in Dragons."

    "text": "The BATTLE OF THE CAMP was a battle between Gondor and the Wainriders.\nHistory Background The Wainriders were beginning to recover from their\ndefeat at Dagorlad and were apparently not completely driven out by the\nrebellion in Rhovanion, and now in TA 1944 made an alliance with Khand\nand Harad. The new Éothéod lord, Forthwini found out about this and\nwarned King Ondoher of it. Meanwhile, Eärnil, based at Pelargir received\nthis news on the ninth day of Cermië and prepared a force that crossed\nthe river Anduin in part, leaving the Fords of the Poros purposely\nundefended. Prelude The northern assault of the Wainriders was met by\nthe King of Gondor himself, Ondoher, with his two sons Artamir and\nFaramir. The Easterlings swept through Gondor's defence, cutting down\nthe King and his heirs and routing his army. While the Wainriders\nattacked Ithilien from the north, the armies of the Haradrim crossed the\nPoros and invaded Southern Ithilien. The Gondor Captain Eärnil had led\nGondor's inferior Southern Army to victory over the Haradrim, destroying\ntheir army in South Ithilien, to the north of the Poros. After his\nvictory, Eärnil turned north. The Battle Believing their victory\ncomplete, and Gondor defenceless before them and apparently unaware of\nthe defeat of their allies in the south, the Wainriders paused in North\nIthilien to celebrate their conquest. The feasting Wainriders suddenly\nfound their success reversed, as Eärnil appeared with his Southern Army,\nreinforced by fleeing members of Ondoher's defeated northern troops.\nEärnil's army descended on the unprepared Wainriders, driving many of\nthem into the swamplands of the Dead Marshes. That eastern people, for\nso long a dreaded enemy of Gondor, never marched against Gondor again.\nThe battle was named after where it had taken place: the Battle of the\nCamp. Aftermath Because there was no heir apparent to the throne,\nOndoher and his sons having been killed in the battle, Eärnil was made\nKing. He was a distant relative of Ondoher, and could trace his lineage\nback to Elendil and Anárion of old. Eärnil's victory is counted as one\nof the biggest military successes in the history of middle earth. With a\nnumerically inferior army than the one that went north, Eärnil was able\nto totally rout the entire allied armies of Harad and Khand a feat that\nwould not be duplicated until the end of the Third Age at the Battle of\nthe Pelennor Fields. The subsequent promotion of Eärnil to the throne of\nGondor gave the southern Dúnedain a boost to moral that had been needed\nsince their many losses during the plague and the invasions that\nfollowed. It also helped improve relations with the northern kingdom of\nArnor. Eärnil's promise of support to Arnor reforged ties that had been\nhanging by a thread for several centuries. The stunning success north of\nthe Poros had positive repercussions throughout the Free Peoples of\nMiddle-earth.",

    "text": "Axes were primarily used by the Dwarves as weapons. A famous user of\nthis weapon is Gimli. Dain's dwarves were described as wielding\n“two-handed mattocks”. The weapons of the Dwarves had long handles to\nextend their reach and increase their impact. There were several\ndifferent types of axes, including single-bladed and double-bladed axes\nas well as throwing axes. Many Dwarves carried more than one Axe. The\nthrowing axe had a foot-long handle and kept most of its weight in the\nblade, to increase the force with which it would hit the target. It had\na range of only ten yards or so and was much smaller than the walking\naxe. A walking axe had a square handle and was about three feet long; it\nhad a single blade so the user could use it as a walking staff. Unlike\ntheir depiction in many fiction settings, double bladed axes (also\ncalled double-bitted axes) are used in logging, while battle axes have\none blade, and sometimes a spike. An Axe could also be used as tool,\nserving multiple purposes. The Sindar of the First Age were lightly\narmed in battle, and used axes as well. Some of the Orcs of Mordor and\nMinas Morgul also used crude axes. Hurin used an axe before he was\ncaptured by Morgoth's forces. He used it to slay most of Gothmog's troll\nbodyguard, before the troll's blood melted the blade. Many of the\nBeornings, most famously Beorn, were known to have wielded axes to chop\nwood and to use as a primary weapon. Saruman's Orc-men were noted to\nhave used battle axes. Axes were one of the four main weapons used by\nthe Rohirrim."

These lands and features include the Withered\nHeath, Iron Hills, Lonely Mountain (Erebor), Dale, and Laketown. The\nmain bodies of water in the area are the rivers Celduin and Carnen\n(Redwater) which flowed further south into the Sea of Rhûn in the East.\nDescription The Northeast was made up of mountains, hills, and lowlands,\nwhich were made up of scrubs, stunted, trees, thickets, and scattered\nwoodlands. The Northeast’s climate was normally cool due to its\nproximity to the polar north with severe winters and cool summers with\ncool and dry prevailing winds coming down from the north. Inhabitants\nThe inhabitants of this region were mostly Orcs, Dwarves, some Dragons,\nand Men. Due the nature of the peoples, underground living was\npreferable save for the Mannish peoples that didn’t live in the\nmountains or the hills. Languages spoken were Orcish dialects, Khuzdul,\nand Mannish languages especially Westron in later days. History These\nlands existed back in the earliest days of Middle-earth but what was\nlater the Grey Mountains was in these days part of the long oppressive\nIron Mountains that dominated the north. In these days, there were no\nknown dwarf or orc colonies in the hills or in the mountains and dragons\nwere not known to have lived in this area at this time, but tribes of\nSilvan elves and later Mannish tribes were known to be living in or near\nthe Northeast. After the War of Wrath when the Beleriand fell beneath\nthe waves, the orcs and the remaining dragons fled into up into the\nmountains and hide and created hidden realms, and became an ever\nincreasing threat. Starting at around TA 1980 when the Dwarves of\nKhazad-dûm were driven out of by the Balrog, dwarves began moving into\nthe Grey Mountains and later into the Lonely Mountain and then into the\nIron Hills. Men also began establishing themselves in Dale and Laketown\nand good relations between the dwarves and men prospered for many years.\nHowever, when the dragon Smaug heard of the happy prosperity of the two\npeoples and their treasures, he descended down upon the two realms and\ndestroyed them. The dwarves were then forced to flee from the Lonely\nMountain and the men moved south into Laketown. After the Battle of Five\nArmies during the Quest of Erebor, the dwarves and the men regained both\nthe Lonely Mountain and Dale and the North-east prospered for many\nyears. The Northeast still thrived into Fourth Age despite attacks by\nthe Easterlings, culminating in the Battle of Dale."

Irregularities were allowed for by adding\nanother three days every twelve years, except the last year of a _yén_.\nThe year (_loa_) begins on March 21st. That day is called _Yestare_. The\nnext day begins the season of _tuile_. _Tuil'e_ ends on May 14th.\n_Laire _begins on May 15th and ends on July 25th. _Yavie_ begins on July\n26th and ends on September 17th. The next three days are the _enderi_\n(September 18th, 19th, and 20th). _Quelle_begins on September 21st and\nends on November 13th. Then'' Hrive ''starts on the 14th. It ends on\nJanuary 24th. _Coire _begins on January 25th and ends on March 19th. The\nnext day is ''Mettare. '' These dates only work until the enderi have\nbeen doubled. Once every twelve years the elves would double the\n''enderi ''to replace having a leap year. Númenórean Calendar The\ncalendar adopted by the Men of Middle-earth was called the King's\nReckoning, and was very similar to our own. It had a week of seven days,\nand divided the 365-day year of the Elves into twelve months (_astar_),\nten with 30 days and two with 31. Also like our calendar, the Númenórean\nyear began in midwinter. They retained the two days between the end of\none year and the start of the next (_mettarë_ and _yestarë_), but\nreduced the mid-year days to one (_loëndë_, essentially adding the other\ntwo to the mid-year “long months”). Leap years had two mid-year days. In\nthe Second and Third Ages, years were reckoned from the beginning of the\nAge. Various irregularities occurred in this calendar, especially\nfollowing the Downfall. In TA 2060, Mardil Voronwë revised the calendar,\nand the new version became the Steward's Reckoning. The months of\nSteward's Reckoning all had 30 days, and there were two additional\n“extra” days at the equinoxes, _tuilérë_ and _yáviérë_. The five extra\ndays (the equinoxes, midsummer and two at midwinter) were holidays. In\nTA 3021, the Reunited Kingdom adopted a New Reckoning, which began the\nyear on the spring equinox, as in the Elven calendar. The months of the\nReckonings were in Quenya (or Sindarin among the Dúnedain) and were:\nQUENYA NAME SINDARIN NAME ------------- --------------- Narvinyë Narwain\nNénimë Nínui Súlìmë Gwaeron Víressë Gwirith Lótessë Lothron Náríë Nórui\nCermië Cerveth Urimë Urui Yavannië Ivanneth Narquelië Narbeleth Hísimë\nHithui Ringarë Girithron Hobbit Calendar (More detail can be found under\nShire Calendar) The Hobbits, who had adopted the King's Reckoning,\naltered it in a different way from the Steward's Reckoning. Like the\nSteward's Reckoning, they had twelve months of thirty days, and five\nholidays outside the months. However, they had three “extra” days in\nmidsummer and two in midwinter, similar to the Elven calendar. In the\nShire the three days of midsummer were called Lithedays, and the two\ndays of midwinter were the Yuledays. In leap years, the extra day was\nadded to the Lithedays and called Overlithe. The other innovation in the\nShire calendar was to make Midsummer's Day (and the Overlithe) outside\nthe week, as well as the month, meaning the days of the week would not\nchange in relation to the days of the year. The Shire Reckoning is the\ncalendar used in the _Red Book of Westmarch_, and hence in _The Lord of\nthe Rings_. It counts from the founding of the Shire in TA 1600. The\nHobbit names of the months came from names used in Anduin in antiquity,\nand their meanings were often obscure or forgotten. They were: SHIRE\nNAME BREE NAME --------------- ------------------------ 2 Yule 2 Yule\nAfteryule Frery Solmath Solmath Rethe Rethe Astron Chithing Thrimidge\nThrimidge Forelithe Lithe 1 Lithe First Summerday Midyear's Day Second\nSummerday Overlithe Third Summerday 2 Lithe Third/Fourth Summerday\nAfterlithe Mede Wedmath Wedmath Halimath Harvestmath Winterfilth\nWintring Blotmath Blooting Foreyule Yulemath 1 Yule 1 Yule (Given the\ndecidedly Old English sound of these names, it can be assumed that this\nis J.R.R.

A drawing of the Inscription appears in\nBook I, Chapter 2 of _The Fellowship of the Ring_, “The Shadow of the\nPast”. A transliteration appears in Book II, Chapter 2, “The Council of\nElrond”, where the inscription is read by Gandalf (listen to the\ninscription): _Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg\nthrakatulûk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul._ These words, in the Black\nSpeech of Mordor, are physically painful to all the free people of\nmiddle earth, except hobbits, who are especially resistant to evil. At\nthe Council of Elrond, most probably because of the power and the shadow\nthey bring (the Shadow being the more harmful to the elves), Elrond is\nseen looking very annoyed when the inscription is read. The inscription\nuses the Fëanorian Characters (Tengwar) because all forms of writing\nTolkien describes at that time were invented by the Elves.

When Isildur had cut the ring from Sauron's hand,\nit was burning hot, and so Isildur was able to transcribe the\ninscription before it faded.

It was located on the\neast bank of the Hayk Sarzain, a ravine filled by the Maudar river to\nform a deep lake, in the midst of the province of Isra. History Tûl Isra\nwas founded in the early Second Age. A trade route branching from the\nCamel Road near the confluence of the Sîresha and Maudar rivers, even\nthen passed by the city on its way to the Tûr Betark and through the\nmountains to the Utter South. The original city was located northwest of\nthe Hayk Sarzain and was inhabited until its destruction in SA 1933, by\nthe forces of Ankhôril, during his conquest of Sirayn. Later in the\nSecond Age, the village of Mumett was founded on the eastern shore of\nthe lake. In TA 83, members of clan Másra from the Tamet Bazain\nrefounded Tûl Isra south of the village on the east bank. The new\nlocation boasted a more defensible bluff which would augment city walls.\nSome of the building materials were taken from the nearby ruins, but\nmuch of the required stone was quarried in the Bru Isra. Initially, a\nthick wall, twenty feet high, was raised, while residences, shops, a\nlarge bazaar and open market, and some administrative offices were\nconstructed within. Gates located on the southern and western edges of\nTûl Isra pierced the defensive rampart. In time, the population out-grew\nthe city. The administrative buildings were moved into a new expansive\nplaza which included a palace. Construction continued for a decade in\norder to complete the complex. During the final phases, the city was\nexpanded to the south by the addition of a new outer wall, and the inner\nwalls were strengthened. Centuries later, following the slow\naccumulation of workshops, artisans’ homes, and dining establishments\noutside the northwestern walls, another section of outer wall was\nconstructed. Throughout the city’s history, continued construction,\nrenovation, and the collapse of old buildings have changed the interior\nstreets and neighborhoods. The city was conquered by orcs and demons\nfrom the south of the Tûr Betark in TA 1175. Obed, the First, recaptured\nthe city in TA 1201. Economy Tûl Isra may appropriately be called the\nmelting pot of Greater Harad. Although the eastern influences prominent\nin the seaport are absent, products from any of the cultural groups\nresiding in southern Endor (whether rubies set in petrified wood from\nGan, carved Mûmakani ivory, prayer beads from Dûshera, or fosewood\nscreens and divans from the Seven Dominions) are readily obtained in the\ncapital’s bazaars. Despite the presence of imports, local artisans\nthrive. Copper, bronze, and brass fittings for tools, riding gear,\nchariots, construction work, and furnishings from Tûl Isra surpass those\nmanufactured anywhere else. And many of the remedies distilled by the\ncapital’s herbalists are unique within Greater Harad.",

    "text": "SIRAYN (“Watered-earth”) was a region of the Greater Harad. It was the\nintellectual and economic hub of southern Middle-earth. Its territory\ncomprises the fertile hills and vales along the northern flank of the\nYellow Mountains, and can be divided into five major areas: Isra,\nKirmlesra (including Kirmlesran Hills and the Dalad Kirm), the eastern\ncoast and forest of Sára Bask, the plain of Chennacatt, and the Tûr\nBetark. The cities of Sirayn were founded along the Sîresha river and\nits tributaries. The cool streams and rolling grasslands characteristic\nof the river valley provide a welcome relief to weary travelers coming\nfrom Bozisha-Dar or Harshandat. History Second Age Early in the Second\nAge, apysaic speaking nomadic tribes from the north and east settled the\nfertile river valleys of Sirayn, when they found extensive stands of\nwild wheat and barley growing on the banks of the Sîresha. Due to the\nabundance of wild grains, the nomads ceased to wander, because the\nsufficient grains could be gathered during the summer and fall to last\nthe rest of the year. Unaccustomed to the cycles of agricultural life,\nthe inhabitants grew restless in the leisure that followed the growing\nseason. Craft specialization and social stratification evolved to fill\nthe void, with the development of a priest hierarchy, temples, and a\nnoble class. At around SA 450, the building of the cities of Chennacatt\nand Tûl Isra starts, and at around SA 600, thirteen independently\nself-governing cities are fully established along the Sîresha river and\nits tributaries. In SA 1211, Bávor's Folk found the city of Mablad-dûm\nin the central Yellow Mountains. As the population grew, pressure to\nexpand into less fertile areas increased. The inhabitants tried to\nduplicate the vast grain fields that grew naturally in the more arable\nvalleys. Over the centuries, they developed irrigation techniques and\nlearned the basics of dry farming. Canals and irrigation works abounded,\nas most major highways were accompanied by irrigation tunnels running\nalongside the pavement. Agriculturists expanded the plants that grew\nnaturally and domesticated new varieties. Hybrid strains of wheat and\nbarley, lentils, grass peas, dates, figs and linseed were developed.\nSome groups returned to the nomadic life and domesticated various\nanimals, such as goats, sheep, cattle and pigs, indigenous to the\nregion. Other nomadic tribes entered the area and lived by raiding or\nadopted the new life style. The presence of bandits and desert-raiders\nhelped to promote the foundation of defensible urban centers. As the\ncities grew, temples were founded, writing was developed, trade was\nformalized between the urban centers and outside cultures, a fixed\nmilitary was organized, and craft specialization flourished. The region\ncontinued developing until Akhôrahil, the Blind Sorcerer, one of the\nNine Nazgûl, began his conquest of Sirayn in SA 1929. Early in the year,\nthe Blind Sorcerer attacks Baud Selen, and by the end of the year, all\nof Chennacatt has fallen to his Ciryatandan forces. In SA 1930,\nAkhôrahil sends his general Wyatan to conquer Tûl Isra and the lands to\nthe east, and in SA 1933, early in the year, Rask and Tûl Isra fall to\nWyatan's forces. Late in the year, Tyarett succumbs. The forces of\nWyatan attack the city of Chamesra in SA 1935, but the combined forces\nof Chamesra and Tûl Harar are able to win the battle at the expense of\nthe city which is ruined in the process. In SA 1940, Wyatan re-assembles\nhis forces and starts a 59 year campaign against Tûl Harar and\nHarshandat. The nomads of Kirmlesra submit to Ankhôril in SA 1979, after\n10 years of internal strife. In SA 1995, the surrender of Tûl Harar\nspells doom for Harshandat, falling one day before the new millenium, in\nSA 1999. The Blind Sorcerer places governors in each province and city\nand begins his rule in the South. A Númenórean army defeats Ankhôril and\nrazes his capital in SA 2280, making him flee to Mordor. In SA 2281, the\npeople of Sirayn and Harshandat rise up and overthrow the Númenóreans,\ndestroying the remaining cities of Tûl Isra and Chennacatt in the\nprocess. Only the seaport city of Tûl Harar remains standing, as it did\nnot oppose the Blind Sorcerer's occupation plans, thus, is the only city\nin Sirayn that has been continuously inhabited from the mid-Second Age.\nThird Age Early in the Third Age, Haradrim tribes from the north\nresettled the river valleys and founded camps along the northern\nfoothills of the Tûr Betark to the south. The discovery of rich ores and\nmineral resources and the new trade routes that developed gave rise to a\nvery prosperous society. Towns and villages sprang up again along the\nmajor rivers, and peace reigned. Around TA 1100, orcs and demons from\nthe south took over the mines and laid siege to the towns and villages\nclosest to the Tûr Betark. By TA 1175, even the newly re-founded city of\nTûl Isra had fallen to the southerly borders. In the spring of TA 1201,\nObed, the First, of clan Másra, reunited the peoples of Chennacatt, Tûl\nIsra, and Kirmlesra and set out to recapture the lands that were lost.\nWielding the famous Blade of Másra, a sword passed down through\ngenerations of the clan, and the Visor of Sirayn, a holy relic dedicated\nto the Master of the Sands, Obed's campaign was successful. All of the\nlands were recovered except for some mines to the south. Obed was slain\nduring the final battles near Horse-head's Peak and was there entombed.\nFrom that time, the Blade and the Visor have not been seen. In TA 1380,\nBazaud Izain, of clan Bulgan, a rival to clan Másra, seized the crown\nand put down clan Másra partisans. The line of Bulgan spread its rule of\nblood and horror, with heavy taxes, oppression, and dark rites. At this\ntime, Tartas Izain became the Taraskon. A sorcerer of great renown and\npower, he was relied upon for advice and his control of the populace.\nTemples to the Silent One were first founded under Tartas' influence.\nThe Bulgan regime lasted until TA 1436, when Bartek Tam, of clan Másra,\nregained the throne. Tartas Izain fled to Chamesra and shortly afterward\nhelped in leading an offensive against Tûl Isra. In the ensuing years,\ngreat battles decimated the towns and villages in the area. In the\nspring of TA 1457, the forces of Chamesra laid siege to Tûl Isra and\ndestroyed a good portion of the city, much of which was not rebuilt. The\nforces of Shuftas Gabar, the sorcerer and ruler of Chamesra, were\neventually forced back to their own city walls. Chamesra resisted her\nfoes for a full two weeks before the warriors and magi of Tûl Isra broke\nthrough their defenses. The city was sacked save for the High Citadel of\nShuftas Gabar, and rumor has it that the power of darkness still guards\nthe fortress. Peace reigned for almost 100 years, until clan Bulgan\ncarried out a bloody coup at Tûl Isra. Once control was cemented in the\nsurrounding countryside, the power of Bulgan spread. Of the six\nremaining cities, all fell to the armies of Tûl Isra with the exception\nof Tûl Harar. Logistics problems and the quality of the Haran navy made\nthe seaport victorious. Plans were laid to conquer this important site\nwhile people of Sirayn searched for the true heir to the throne.\nGeography The majority of northern Sirayn is covered with sand. Only the\nscattered oases and river valleys support human life. The Tarnet Bazain,\nhome of clan Másra, is one of two inhabited sites between the Sîresha\nand Tûl Póac to the north. The southern territories are more fertile.\nDry water channels and wadis corrugate the land thoughout Greater Harad.\nInfrequent cloudbursts produce flashfloods that roar through these\nbreaks in Kirmlesra, while annual flooding due to runoff from the Tûr\nBetark produces seasonal flow in the gulleys of Chennacatt and Isra.\nRegions - Isra, portion of lands that slowly rise from the Sîresha river\nand the Sára Bask to the foothills of the Tûr Betark. - Sára Bask, a\nvast forest, stretching from the junction of the Sîresha and Sîrsis\nrivers to the coast of the Bay of Ormal. - Kirmlesra, region comprised\nof two dissimilar, but equally desolate areas, the Dalad Kirm and the\nKirmlesran Hills. - Chennacatt, region that occupies a plateau that\nextends south from the Sîresha to the Tûr Betark and east to the Bru\nIsra. - Tûr Betark, this range of mountains is the eastern end of the\nYellow Mountains and isolates Sirayn from the lands south. Climate The\nnorthern desert portions of Chennacatt and Isra (the Haradwaith) are\nvery inospitable. The area is hot, with temperatures rising above one\nhundred degrees during the day, followed by a drop of 30 to 50 degrees\nduring the night. Near the coast and in the fertile areas to the south,\nthe weather is equally hot, but the land is quite arable due to the\nabundance of mountain rainfall and glacial runoff and the presence of\nrivers. The Tûr Betark are very high, over ten thousand feet in height,\nand exhibit a true alpine environment. The Sîrani have three basic\nseasons: Sadayn (“Flood”), Kramask (“Planting”), and Bauga\n(“Water-channels”). Since the climate is dry, the seasons stem primarily\nfrom weather profile in the mountain range. The month of Tarsk starts\nthe season of Bauga, when rainfall in the peaks of the Tûr Betark\nbegins, and the wadis of Isra and Chennacatt are dry no longer. The\nmountains receive the greatest amount of rain during Hirain, Tarsas, and\nTars, before precipitation wanes again. In the month of Magaub, when\nmountain precipitation is tampering off, the warming temperatures melt\nglaciars and snowfields melt whose moisture combines with the rainfall\nto create the annual flooding of the Sîresha and its tributaries. Thus\nbegins the season of Sadayn. Glacial runoff and snowmelt continue strong\nthrough Gerzaud and then taper to almost nothing. As the floodwaters\nrecede, rich sediments deposited by the river remain to rejuvinate the\ntopsoil, and the planting and growing season, Kramask, begins in the\nmonth of Sain. The year's twelve months were based originally on the\nElven calendar. The Elven month Narwain equates to the Siranean month of\nTars, the first month of the year, set in the winter. The names of the\nmonths in Elvish are Narwain, Ninui, Gwaeron, Gwirith, Lothron, Nórui,\nCerveth, Urui, Ivanneth, Narbeth, Hithui, and Girithron."

    "text": "CHENNACATT was a region of Sirayn, that comprised of a plateau south of\nthe Sîresha river, rising some 500 to 1000 feet above the water's\nsurface. Geography The terrain is very flat and extends south from the\nSîresha to the Tûr Betark and east to the Bru Isra. The plateau was\nformed early in the First Age when a large volcano (south and west of\nthe Bru Isra) erupted and slowly filled the area composing the plain of\nChennacatt. The only feature that breaks the plateau is a tributary of\nthe upper Sîresha. Most of the southern bank of the river is bounded by\ncliffs. Its eastern branch forms a large gorge that extends south from\nthe city of Tartaust. The western branch runs between the plateau and\nthe Tûr Betark. At the headwaters of the western branch, the carved\ntiers of whole mountain form the impressive secondary hold of Akhôrahil.\nThe under-populated plateau sees an average of 3 inches of rainfall a\nyear. During the flood season (Sadayn), small ponds hold water until\nearly summer, as non-porous rock layers underlie the plateau. The\ntemperature is ten to twenty degrees cooler than in the lower lands to\nthe north. Despite the lack of rain, water is available. Small ponds and\nartesian wells dot the plateau. The only fertile areas of Chennacatt lie\nalong the Sîresha. Some farming is performed on the plain itself, but\nthe fields yield scant harvests. Only short grasses flourish. Their\nabundance makes the plain highly prized for grazing sheep and goats.\nFlora and fauna The flora of Chennacatt is typical of a semi-arid\nhighland plateau. Fibrous grasses intermingled with nettles and gorse\npredominate. One particularly tough grass stalk is harvested to make a\nstrong linen thread, excellent for weaving into sturdy fabrics. The\nclimate of the plain does not permit the growing of food crops, and the\nhuman inhabitants who farm dwell near the river, relying on irrigation\nand annual flooding to water their fields. Their crops include wheat,\nbarley, and some legumes. Most were imported from Isra, with but a few\nspecies domesticated from local strains. - Kafe - This native plant is\nused to make a local hot drink. The beans of the bush are dried and\nground. The grindings are boiled to produce an aromatic hot drink served\nwith sugar. - Wifwif - A small grey flower that pollinates at night. If\nthe wifwif‘s pollen is inhaled, it causes a deep coma for up to a week\nin duration. The pollen may be collected carefully, stabilized in a\npowder base, and inhaled in small doses to promote sleep. To supplement\nthe limited agriculture, the inhabitants domesticated a number of the\nlocal animals. The first species to be bred in captivity were goats and\nsheep. Rabbits and cattle fonned later additions to the herds. Other\nanimals that still run wild in Chennacatt include ground squirrels,\nfoxes, some large predatory cats related to the a-lori-ma-lau, wild\ndogs, song birds, predatory birds, like hawks, eagles, and vultures, and\nlizards. - Caja - One of the most feared denizens of Chennacatt is the\nCaja, a snake with a highly poisonous bite. The serpent frequents remote\nrocky terrain and ruins. It often grows up to six feet in length, and,\nwhen moving, can easily outdistance a human runner. The only natural\npredator of the caja is the mongoose. - Hanajaib - This jackal-like\nscavenger is the scourge of Chennacatt. People say that whenever the\nhanajaib laughs, death is on the wind. The animals are easily scared\noff, but will fight to the death if cornered. In times of drought, they\nattempt to kill young herd animals, as well as travellers who are\ninjured or ill. - Wild Goats - The wild goats of Chennacatt are highly\nprized for their wool. Bausairin, or Wool-theives, make their living by\ncapturing the goats, shearing them, and releasing the animals to the\nwilds. The wool is sold to more sedentary folk who weave it into\nwaterproof fabric which lasts for generations. The color of the wool\nranges from white to medium brown."

    "page_id": "4266",
    "text": "The Valar and Eldar now fully understood the extent of Melkor's\ntreachery. Fëanor, upon learning of his father's murder and the theft of\nhis prized Silmarils, named Melkor “Morgoth”, or “Black Foe of the\nWorld” (literally “Black Enemy”). Now King of the Ñoldor, Fëanor\ndelivered the most impassioned speech ever given in Arda, which he\nunwittingly filled with Morgoth's taint. He railed against the Great\nEnemy, but because of Morgoth's influence, he also blamed the Valar for\nMorgoth's deeds. He persuaded most his people that because the Valar had\nabandoned them, the Ñoldor must follow him to Middle-earth and fight\nMorgoth. Fëanor then swore the terrible Oath of Fëanor which all seven\nof his sons also proclaimed, vowing to fight anyone and everyone —\nwhether Elf, Man, Maia, or Valar — who withheld the Silmarils, and\ninvoking even Ilúvatar as a witness. This became known as the Oath of\nFëanor and later the cause for great tragedy among his seven sons.\nSeeking a way to get to Middle-earth, he went to the shores of Aman,\nwhere the seafaring Teleri lived, and demanded the use of their ships.\nThe Teleri refused, and in response, Fëanor and his armed and\nimpassioned Ñoldor attacked the lightly-armed Teleri, destroyed their\nsettlements and seized the ships. This act is known as the First\nKinslaying. In repentance of this act, Finarfin, Finwë's third son, took\nhis host and turned back. They were accepted by the Valar, and Finarfin\nruled as High-King of the Noldor in Valinor. There were not enough ships\nto carry all of the Ñoldor across the sea, so Fëanor and his sons led\nthe first group. Upon arriving at Losgar, in the land of Lamoth, in the\nfar west of Beleriand, where and Ungoliant had passed not long before,\nthey decided to burn the ships and leave the followers of Fingolfin\nbehind. However, Fëanor accidentally left his son Amras in the ships,\nand he was burned alive. The earth being flat in those days, the\nremaining Ñoldor saw the flames, and perceived that if they were to go\nto Middle-earth[[, they had no choice but to cross the [[Helcaraxë. This\nthey did under the leadership of Fingolfin, and suffered great losses\nalong the way, which greatly added to the animosity they had for Fëanor\nand his sons. Learning of the Ñoldor's arrival, Morgoth summoned his\narmies from his fortress of Angband and attacked Fëanor's encampment in\nMithrim. This battle was called the Battle under the Stars, or\n_Dagor-nuin-Giliath_, for the Sun and Moon had not yet been made. The\nÑoldor managed to win the battle, and disperse Morgoth's armies. Fëanor,\nstill in a great rage, pressed on toward Angband with his sons. He came\neven within sight of Angband, but was ambushed by a force of Balrogs,\nwith few elves about him. He fought mightily, hewing even after\nreceiving several wounds from Gothmog, captain of the Balrogs. His sons\ncame upon the Balrogs with great force of elves, and were able to drive\nthem off. However, as Fëanor was being escorted off the battlefield, he\nknew his wounds were mortal. He cursed Angband thrice, but with the eyes\nof death, he knew that his elves, unaided, would never throw down the\ndark towers. At the moment of his death the passing of his fiery spirit\nreduced his body to ashes. His sons were still bound by the Oath to\nrecover the Silmarils, which would determine the events of Middle-earth\nduring the First Age."

    "title": "The Wold",

    "text": "THE WOLD also known as the WOLD OF ROHAN or WOLD were the upland\ngrasslands of Rohan. Description This was the northeastern area of\nRohan. It was located between Fangorn Forest and River Anduin. To the\nnorth lay river Limlight and in the south by the East Emnet. The area\nwas virtually treeless and somewhat bleak and was comparable to the\nadjacent Brown Lands to the east. History In the distant past - perhaps\nup to the mid-Second Age, the Wold was once well suited to the\ncultivation of crops and probably had many trees (judging by its name),\nbut during the War of the Elves and Sauron, Sauron invaded the rest of\nMiddle-earth and left lands like the Wold in ruins. Many important\nbattles happened in the Wold: - When Eorl the Young arrived in\nCalenardhon he destroyed a host of orcs there. - In the year TA 2545\nEorl the Young was killed in the Wold in a battle against the\nEasterlings. Significance in The Lord of the Rings In The Two Towers,\nthis is where Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas meet Éomer and are given the\nhorses Arod and Hasufel. During the War of the Ring, an army of orcs\nfrom Dol Guldur unsuccessful in their invasion of Lórien were surprised\nby an attack of Ents led by Treebeard in the Wold, and were defeated.\nMiscellaneous Information The name Wold likely derives from the Anglian\nOld English “wold” meaning forest or woodland (compare to the West Saxon\n“weald” and German “Wald,” for example). Since the region was originally\nheavily forested but became bleak and treeless after Sauron ravaged it,\na similarity may be drawn between the Wold of Rohan and the Weald of\nSoutheastern England. This region was once covered by woodland; over\ncenturies, however, local industry, especially iron production, led to\ndeforestation. The etymological relation, as well as the historical\nsimilarity (especially when considering Sauron's fondness of destructive\nindustrialization and Tolkien's personal dislike of such), indicate that\nthe name Wold is likely an intentional play on words on Tolkien's part,\nsimilar perhaps to possibly intentional use of Atalantë (Atlantis) for\nNumenor."

History In this period before the Elves appeared,\nthe Valar had ordered the world as they wished and rested upon Almaren\n(their first kingdom), and Melkor lurked beyond the Walls of Night.\nDuring this time, the Vala Yavanna planted the seeds that she had long\nprepared and the first plants and forests started to grow. Animals as\nwell as many other beasts appeared as well roaming and traversing the\nnew world. Afterwards, the Valar rested allowing things to take stock of\nthemselves enjoying the fruits of their labors and the bliss of the new\nworld. Then the Valar made a great feast and celebrated as Tulkas\nmarried Nessa and things were merry. Tulkas then began to sleep. It was\nat this time that Melkor, a form with a sense terror and malice that\nonly the Valar have ever seen decided to return to Arda settling in the\nfar north where the light of Illuin was dim. There he began delving the\ndeeps of a great fortress known as Utumno and from there he made his\nplans to despoil the works of the Valar. He blighted and poisoned the\nearth causing living things to fall sick and rot. Knowing that it could\nonly be the work of Melkor, they began to search for him but Melkor was\nalready prepared and before they could find him, he struck destroying\nthe two Lamps of the Valar. The casting down of the great pillars of the\nlamps threw the seas into chaos and so also set the world ablaze, as\ngreat flames poured out from the lamps. The world was broken and the\nValar could not deal with Melkor because their greater strength was\nneeded to restrain the tumults of the world. The Spring of Arda was\nover. Almaren was destroyed. Shortly afterwards, the Valar moved to the\nfar western land of Aman and made it their home. There they fenced\nthemselves in and created the Two Trees for light. A new era had begun."

History The Secret Fire seems to refer to that aspect of Eru\nIlúvatar which is his Power of Creation. This power was with Ilúvatar at\nthe very beginning, so when Melkor sought for it alone, it was in vain,\nfor he could never find it because it was solely with Eru himself.\nLater, Eru set it (or an aspect of it) at the Heart of Arda. The Secret\nFire was also described as being part of all Fëa, the soul of a living\nbeing or the spirit: it was that Gift which makes sentient beings\ncapable of independent thought and will. In _The Fellowship of the\nRing_, Gandalf the Grey referred to both the Secret Fire and the Flame\nof Anor at the Bridge of Khazad-dum when confronting the Balrog: _Anor_\nwas a name for the Sun in the mythology, as well as a name for the _True\nWest_ (i.e. Valinor). Further, some have speculated that Gandalf said\n“flame of Anor” in reference to the fact that he wielded one of the\nThree Rings of Power, Narya. Thus it is uncertain if the _flame of Anor_\nwas identical to the _Secret Fire_, but both it and _The Secret Fire_\nidentified Gandalf as a servant of the Valar."

History Before the Two Trees Whilst\ndwelling on the island of Almaren, the two most prominent towers in all\nof Arda were Helcar and Ringol which held the great lamps of Illuin and\nOrmal that lit the world in its youth. They both were thrown down and\ndestroyed by Melkor, causing a great change to the world. Before the Sun\nand Moon Successfully reaching Aman, the Elves built Tirion where stood\nthe Mindon Eldaliéva, which dominated the city and symbolized elven\nglory in the far West. First Age When the Noldor returned to\nMiddle-earth in pursuit of Morgoth, many towers were built for the\nobservation of the enemy in the North. The tallest and most prominent\nbeing Minas Tirth built by Finrod to watch the northern plain of\nArd-galen, until it was conquered by Sauron. Second Age Early As the\nBeleriand and its great civilizations were destroyed at the end of the\nFirst Age, the only great towers in Arda were located in Eldamar and\nNúmenor. The elves of Tol Eressëa built a great tower in the eastern\npart of the island used for observing the sea. Men of Numenor yearning\nfor the west could see its lights from both the haven of Andúnië and\nfrom the decks of their great ships. Later After Numenor's destruction\nand the removal of Aman from the circles of the world, the surviving\nDúnedain of the Realms in Exile built towers of their own most of which\nheld a Palantír, which they used to order their kingdoms and to\ncommunicate with each other during times of strife. In the northwest\nlied the white towers of Arnor. Elostirion, built by Gil-galad in honor\nof Elendil was its tallest and most prominent. Northeast of it was the\ntower of Annúminas in the capital, and further to the southeast was the\ntower of Amon Sûl on Weathertop. In far southeast of Amon Sûl was the\ntower Orthanc in Isengard or Angrenost which in those days belonged\nexclusively to Gondor. Then, there were the great towers of Gondor\nproper in Minas Anor, Osgiliath, and Minas Ithil all of which held one\nof the seeing stones in those days. Third Age During the turbulent times\nthat came with the Third Age, many of the great towers of the Dúnedain\nwere destroyed, abandoned or occupied by the enemy. Of the most infamous\nwere Orthanc, the Tower of Cirith Ungol, and the Towers of the Teeth\nsome of which were originally built by the Dúnedain after the war of the\nLast Alliance to keep watch on Mordor, but were abandoned and left\nbehind due to the waning of the kingdoms of men and the Great Plague.\nOrthanc was occupied by Saruman and soon became a place of evil rivaling\nSauron. Only the Tower of Ecthelion remained good and was seen as a\nsymbol of hope. After the War of the Ring and the restoration of the\ngreat kingdoms of men and that of peace, the great towers of the enemy\nfell and were destroyed. Orthanc still stood and was for a time ruled by\nTreebeard until he gave it up. Barad-dûr, the ultimate stronghold of the\nDark Lord Sauron, had been the highest tower in all Middle-earth during\nthis age. Fourth Age and Beyond Orthanc remained into King Elessar's\ntime, and was found to contain many of his ancestor's heirlooms and\ntreasures hoarded up and hidden by Saruman. It is unknown whether new\ntowers were erected by the men of the Reunited Kingdom.

History The Vala Lórien or Irmo dwelt\nfar from Valmar though still within Valinor. His dwellings were built\nsouth by the feet of the mountains of Valinor, upon the confines of the\nrealm. Aulë had made Lorien's halls of mist gathered beyond Avathar upon\nthe Shadowy Seas. His hall was great and dimly lit and had wide gardens\nwhich wandered marvelously about, winding near to the feet of Telperion\nwhose shining lit them. The gardens were full of labyrinths and mazes,\nfor Yavanna had given Lórien a great wealth of yew trees and cedars, and\nof pines that exuded drowsy aromas in the dusk, and these hung over deep\npools. Bright glowworms crept about their borders and Varda had set\nstars within their depths for the pleasure of Irmo. His Maiar servants\nsang wonderfully in these gardens and the scent of nightflowers and the\nsongs of sleepy nightingales filled them with great loveliness. There\ntoo grew the poppies glowing red in the dusk, and those the Valar called\nFumellar; the flowers of sleep. In the middle of his gardens was set a\nring of shadowy cypress reaching high above the cauldron Silindrin where\nIrmo, gazing upon it, saw many visions of mystery pass upon its face. In\nthe gardens were also a lake called Lorellin, and in the lake was an\nisle whereupon Estë slept. Being the most beautiful place in Arda, the\nGardens of Lòrien were set upon a unique natural background containing\nforest groves, flowers, silver willows, fountains, and lakes; the\noverall color scheme seems to have been silver. Within the Gardens was\nLorellin, the tree-shadowed lake where, on a small island at its center,\nsleeps Estë. Not far from its shores is a small dwelling. It is\nconsidered a place of healing, rest and refresh and many, Valar and Elf\nalike come there to relax from the cares or burdens of the world. There\nare also many spirits loose upon the gardens. Here lay the body of\nMíriel, the first wife of Finwë, and for a time he came frequently to\nsee her here. Gandalf originally lived here, as did Melian before she\nbecame Queen of Doriath.

    "title": "Oath of Fëanor",
    "page_id": "4267",
    "text": "The OATH OF FËANOR was an oath taken by Fëanor and his seven sons to\nnon-negotiable enmity against any person who would take a Silmaril or\nkeep it from them. After Morgoth killed Finwe and stole the Silmarilli,\nthis oath became the cause of some of the most terrible and tragic\ncrimes in the history of Arda. History Learning of his father's death at\nthe hands of Morgoth, Fëanor went back to Tirion, breaking the exile set\nby the Valar. At Tirion, Fëanor gave an impassioned speech in which he\nconvinced the vast majority of the Ñoldor to follow him to Middle-earth\nto wrest the Silmarils back from Morgoth and avenge Finwë. At the end of\nhis speech, furious and ever prideful, Fëanor swore the dreadful oath to\nEru, calling Manwë and Varda in witness. This oath saw him pledge, on\npain of calling upon himself the Everlasting Darkness, to pursue with\nviolence any who would keep or hold a Silmaril from him, no matter who\nit was, and no matter what the reason or circumstance. His seven sons\nleaped to his side and swore the oath with him. Fëanor died soon after\nhis return to Middle-Earth but the remaining oath-takers, his sons,\nlived on in relative harmony with the Eldar of Beleriand, in no small\npart thanks to the diplomatic skill of Maedhros. For the greater part of\nthe First Age, the oath kept the sons of Fëanor united in one cause: to\ndefeat Morgoth and retrieve the Silmarils, for so long as the jewels\nremained in the hands of the Dark Lord, they were irretrievable by\nforce. And so the oath slumbered, as by fighting Morgoth, even\nhopelessly, the brothers were still technically attempting to fulfill\nit. However, the terrible dangers of the oath became apparent when Beren\nand Lúthien managed to recover one of the jewels from Morgoth. Now that\nthe jewel was no longer in Morgoth's hands, it became possible for the\nbrothers to retrieve it and genuinely fulfill the oath. Beren gave the\nSilmaril to King Thingol of Doriath who had demanded it as a bride-price\nfor his daughter, believing that Beren could not possibly retrieve one.\nWhen the sons of Fëanor learned of this, they demanded its surrender.\nHowever, Thingol was insulted by the demand and had begun to lust for\nthe Silmaril. He refused their request, and Curufin and Celegorm openly\nthreatened to destroy Doriath. This threat was the cause of considerable\nturmoil and resulted in much grief, for Maedhros was attempting at the\ntime to forge a coalition between the various Elven kingdoms to engage\nin a final, decisive strike against Morgoth's power. The threat caused\nThingol to close his borders and send no aid to the military alliance.\nThough the Elves would not have had the power in any circumstance to\noverthrow Morgoth, the loss of Thingol's aid proved detrimental to the\nalliance. After the Elven defeat during Nírnaeth Arnoediad, a series of\nunfortunate events led to the death of King Thingol and the\ndisappearance of Queen Melian, who returned to Valinor in grief. With\nher departure, the Girdle of Melian, which had protected Doriath from\nattack, faded. Beren and Lúthien's son, Dior, was crowned King of\nDoriath. He likewise refused to surrender the jewel, and the brothers\nattacked Doriath and sacked the halls of the Sindar, committing the\nsecond kin-slaying. However, the Silmaril escaped the destruction of\nDoriath and the oath drove the sons onwards. Eventually, they learned\nthat it it had come into the possession of Elwing, who dwelt near the\nmouths of Sirion. They attacked the and slaughtered the defenseless\nexiles of Gondolin and Doriath, committing the third and most terrible\nkin-slaying. But the Silmaril escaped them again and was borne by\nEärendil into the West. That Silmaril was forever lost to the sons of\nFëanor but two more remained in the crown of Morgoth. With the complete\ndestruction of the Elven kingdoms of Beleriand, it seemed impossible\nthat these would ever see the light of day again. However, Eärendil\nconvinced the Valar to take pity on the Elves and Edain under Morgoth's\npower, and initiated the War of Wrath. This war saw Morgoth's power\nutterly overthrown, and the two remaining Silmarils were wrested from\nhim. However, most of the sons of Fëanor had been slain in battle, and\nno few of them during the kinslayings by their victims. The only\nbrothers to survive the third and final kinslaying were Maedhros and\nMaglor. They demanded the Silmarils from Eönwë, the standard bearer of\nManwë, but because of the wicked deeds they had committed in the name of\nretrieving it, they were denied. By now sick at heart of keeping the\ndreadful oath, neither particularly wanted anything more to do with the\nSilmarils, and Maglor openly opposed attempting to retrieve them.\nHowever, Maedhros convinced him to help him lay hands upon the jewels,\nclaiming that because of the oath, they simply had no choice. They snuck\nin to the camp of the victorious Host of the West, slew the guard around\nthe jewels, and retrieved them. The camp was roused against them, and\nthey prepared themselves to die defending their claim. But Eönwë simply\npermitted them to leave unharmed. However, due to the terrible deeds\ncommitted by the brothers in their retrieval of the Silmarils they found\nthey could not handle the Silmarils without enduring searing pain. The\ntwo brothers parted and in his anguish Maedhros threw himself and his\nSilmaril into a fiery chasm. Maglor on the other hand tossed his\nSilmaril into the sea and was said to wander the coast forever after\nlamenting his loss and pain. The Oath The Oath itself, as given in\n_Morgoth's Ring_, is as follows: “Be he foe or friend, be he foul or\nclean Brood of Morgoth or bright Vala, Elda or Maia or Aftercomer, Man\nyet unborn upon Middle-earth, Neither law, nor love, nor league of\nswords, Dread nor danger, not Doom itself Shall defend him from Fëanáro,\nand Fëanáro’s kin, Whoso hideth or hoardeth, or in hand taketh, Finding\nkeepeth or afar casteth A Silmaril. This swear we all… Death we will\ndeal him ere Day’s ending, Woe unto world’s end! Our word hear thou, Eru\nAllfather! To the everlasting Darkness doom us if our deed faileth… On\nthe holy mountain hear in witness and our vow remember, Manwë and\nVarda!\""

The climate hovered near the\nmoderate and the extreme with mild winters and hot, dry summers, and the\nterrain consisted of scattered woodlands. History South Gondor was part\nof the Kingdom of Gondor in the early in the Third Age and soon was\nsubdued by Tarannon Falastur. South Gondor stayed with Gondor until the\nKin-strife, which was fought by the Kings of Gondor and the Corsairs of\nUmbar. Soon during the War of the Ring South Gondor was described as a\n“_debatable and desert land_”. In the Fourth Age, it was a part of the\nReunited Kingdom."

Pre-Battle The ancestors of\nthe Rohirrim were called to the aid of Gondor because they were attacked\nby the Balchoth who frequently made raids on the eastern side of Anduin\nuntil the people left. Cirion learned from his spies that the Balchoth\nwere gathering a great army to attack the province of Calenardhon on the\nwest side of the river and the defence there was too weak for an attack.\nCirion prepared to lead an army to Calenardhon and sent six riders to\nask for help. These went through the Balchoth army and five were killed\nwhile one named Borondir made it to the land of Éothéod and delivered\nhis message. Eorl the Young realized that if Gondor fell soon his people\nmight too. So Eorl led 7000 riders and hundreds of mounted archers on\nthe journey to the 500 mile trip to Calenardhon. The Battle The Balchoth\nhad built many boats on the side of Anduin at the Undeeps of Calenardhon\nand came over and crossed the river and with their superior numbers\novercame the forces on the west bank easily. Soon Cirion came with an\narmy of reinforcements, but the Balchoth cut them off and drove them to\nthe north over the Limlight to the Field of Celebrant and then a host of\nOrcs came and attacked Cirion's forces driving them to Anduin. When the\nsituation looked bleak for Gondor the Éothéod arrived and crossed the\nUndeeps into Calenardhon and came over to the Limlight to attack the\nWainriders and the Orcs from the rear. This combined force of Gondor and\nthe Éothéod drove the Balchoth across the Limlight then slew the\ninvaders until Calenardhon was free.

It was\npublished in 1983 in _The Monsters and the Critics_. This paper is\nwidely regarded as a formative work in early 20th century _Beowulf_\nstudies; some claim that without it, the poem, _Beowulf_, might not be\nstudied today. In this talk, Tolkien speaks against critics who play\ndown the fantastic elements of the poem (Grendel, Grendel's Mother, the\ndragon, etc.) in favor of using _Beowulf_ solely as a source for\nAnglo-Saxon history. Tolkien argues that rather than being merely\nextraneous, these elements are key to the narrative and should be the\nfocus of study. Later critics who disagreed with Tolkien on this point\nhave routinely had to cite him and systematically defend their\narguments.

Mythology In Tolkien's mythology for England which evolved\ninto Middle-earth legendarium; Eriol or Ælfwine is an English mariner of\nthe ‘Anglo-Saxon’ period who, sailing far westwards over the ocean, came\nat last to Tol Eressëa, the Lonely Isle, where dwelt Elves who had\ndeparted from ‘the Great Lands’, afterwards ‘Middle-Earth’. During his\nsojourn in Tol Eressëa he learned from them the true and ancient history\nof the Creation, of the Gods, of the Elves, and of England. England\n(ANGOL, LUTHANY, LUTHIEN, LEITHIAN, LEITHIEN, INGOLONDE, ENGALAND,\nONGULCYNNE) is an island of Arda (Earth) in some versions of Tolkien's\nmythology. In general it lies next to Ireland (Isle of Ivren, Hibernia,\nErin) and is located within Britain (aka Leithian, Luthian,\nLuthien).Which is entering considering that Leithien/Luthien had several\nmeanings for Tolkien, including name of elf princes, an alternate name\nfor England, and also “release/release from bondage” (see Lay of\nLeithian). The geographical context of England changes depending on the\nversion within development. Sometimes Ælfwine leaves from England (and\nthis is the case in much of the late stories concerning the mariner and\nPengolod). In some stories England lies off the coast of the Outer Lands\n(Great Lands of the East/Middle-earth) where it was brought there by the\nGods, or was shattered during the war of the Gods (creating several\nislands including nearby Ireland). But became home of elves. In some\nstories this island is associated with Tol Eressëa and is located to the\nfar West, in sight of Valinor. Sometimes its just an island off the main\ncoast of Middle-earth (perhaps west of Forodwaith. But with Middle-earth\nas seen as the north continent of Earth (_Arda_) in an imaginary period\nof the Earth's past (Tolkien placed the end of the Third Age at about\n6,000 years before his own time), in the sense of a “secondary or\nsub-creational reality”. Its general position is reminiscent of Europe,\nwith the environs of the Shire intended to be reminiscent of England\n(more specifically, the West Midlands, with Hobbiton set at the same\nlatitude as Oxford). While Tolkien never fully dropped the idea of Arda\nbeing 'earth' even into the late 1970s, he became less concerned with\nmaintaining consistent 'geography' (though he did experiment with both\nflat earth and round earth versions of his tales, and in later sources\nthe connections between locations in Arda and on modern earth became\nmore abstract (continental Hobbiton and Rivendell for example being part\nof England, roughly the latitude of Oxford, yet not being on an island,\nand Minas Tirith being at the latitude of modern Florence, and Pelargir\nlocated close to the same spot as ancient Troy)."

History After the\nbloody Battle of Dagorlad, the Last Alliance began their invasion into\nMordor. They captured the Black Gate but lost many as they passed\nthrough Udûn, a plateau north of Mordor, and they failed to break into\nthe Dark Tower. Thus, they laid siege on the Dark Tower. The siege\nlasted for a total of seven years. Many elves and men were killed in the\nsiege as seemingly endless numbers of arrows, rocks, flaming missiles,\nand Orc sorties emerged from the tower. Fortunately, Anárion's army from\nGondor managed to reinforce the Last Alliance. On the sixth year of the\nsiege, SA 3440, Anárion was hit in the head by a stone and died. A year\nlater, Gil-galad and Elendil duelled Sauron on the slopes of Mount Doom.\nSauron, however, was much more powerful, and killed first Gil-galad with\nthe heat of his hand, and then Elendil, as Elrond, Círdan, and Isildur\nhelplessly watched. As Elendil fell, his great sword Narsil broke\nbeneath him. But Sauron had been mortally wounded in the battle, and\nwhen Isildur cut the One Ring from Sauron's body his spirit fled. After\nthe battle, Sauron's body was broken, the tower of Barad-dûr collapsed\n(without the Ring's destruction the foundations remained), and the Orc\nhosts were in disarray. Elrond led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom,\nwhere the One Ring was forged, and the only place it could be destroyed.\nHowever, he claimed it for his own, which led to his death. Gondor later\nreoccupied Minas Ithil and Ithilien, and set watchtowers at the Black\nGate, and the pass of Cirith Ungol. However, years of neglect, and the\nKin-strife led these areas to be captured by the Nazgûl, with Minas\nIthil, later Minas Morgul, falling to the Witch-king.

    "text": "GLITTERING CAVES, also known as AGLAROND, was the cave system located\nbehind the Deeping Wall of Helm's Deep. Description The Glittering Caves\nwas an immense, beautiful, and ore-laden cave system that extended deep\ndown into the White Mountains for many miles and consisted of many\ndifferent paths, tunnels, and chambers. A small stream ran down through\nThe Narrows of Helm's Deep and into the caves and was its source of\nwater. Gimli's poetic description of the caves to Legolas in _The Two\nTowers_ is considered by some to be Tolkien's most beautiful writing in\nthe trilogy. According to the _The Atlas of Middle-earth_, it extended\nsome 4,000 feet into the mountain. History Before the War of the Ring\nGlittering Caves was one of the two fortresses built by Númenóreans to\nguard the Fords of Isen, Angrenost (later Isengard) being the other.\nLike Angrenost to the north it was initially well - guarded, but as the\npopulation of Calenardhon (the later Rohan) dwindled it was increasingly\nless supplied and deemed unimportant, until it was only ruled by a\nhereditary small guard who intermarried much with Dunlendings. When\nCirion, Steward of Gondor, gave Calenardhon to the Éothéod, the\nGlittering Caves was transferred to the Rohirrim who used it for refuge\nduring war, strife, and the storage of provisions, but guard duty of the\nFords was initially shared between Gondor and Rohan. The fortress then\nunderwent repair with help from the masons of Gondor. The Gondor guard\nwas merged with that of Angrenost to the north, which remained in the\nkeep of Gondor. The shared garrisoning of the fortress continued for a\ntime until soon it was solely part of Rohan and maintained only by the\nRohirrim. During the reign of Helm Hammerhand, the Dunlendings attacked\nfrom Isengard and across the river Isen conquering parts of Rohan.\nEdoras was overran and sacked, and King Helm was forced to lead much of\nhis people into the caves where they remained during the Long Winter of\nTA 2758 and TA 2759. Because Helm always blew a great horn before riding\nout to fight the beleaguering Dunlendings, the keep was renamed\nHORNBURG. War of the Ring and afterwards During the War of the Ring, the\nHornburg was the refuge of the Rohirrim during the Battle of the\nHornburg after being driven back by the Host of Saruman. After the war,\nGimli the Dwarf, who had fought mightily in that battle, was allowed to\nsettle a colony of Durin's folk there, leading a host of Dwarves from\nthe Lonely Mountain and became the first Lord of the Glittering Caves.\nFrom this stronghold, after it had been carefully constructed, Gimli\nforged a new gate for Minas Tirith made of Mithril and Steel. Gimli and\nLegolas made a pact of friendship, that when the wars of their age\nended, that Gimli should walk in the deep woods of Fangorn and that\nLegolas should behold the jeweled-splendour of the Glittering Caves. The\nGlittering Caves lay in front of a huge and very beautiful cave system\nwhich proved irresistible to him.

He\nfought many battles in the name of his master Morgoth, and was\npersonally responsible for killing two of the High Kings of the Ñoldor.\nGothmog, like the rest of his kind, carried a fiery whip into battle,\nbut he was also known to have wielded a great black axe, which was\nfeared by elves across the continent of Beleriand. Biography Gothmog was\ninitially one of the Maiar who were under the allegiance of Melkor.\nPrior to the Revolt of the Ñoldor, he was the High Captain of Angband\nand given the title “Lord of the Balrogs.” During the Dagor-nuin-Giliath\nin YT 1498, Fëanor pressed to Angband with his company, and in that\nhour, the Balrogs were issued forth. Gothmog was among them. Fëanor came\neven within sight of Angband, but was ambushed with few elves about him.\nSoon he stood alone, but long he fought on alone with all balrogs.\nGothmog turned in at the end of the bout, and at the last Gothmog, Lord\nof the Balrogs, smote him to the ground, inflicting a mortal wound, and\nthe High King of the Ñoldor plunged to the ground. The Sons of Fëanor\narrived and carried the body of their father away, but Fëanor had\npassed. Gothmog reappeared as a general of Angband in several more major\nconflicts, including the Dagor Aglareb and the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.\nDuring the Nirnaeth, Gothmog engaged the High King of the Ñoldor,\nFingon, in battle. Gothmog separated Fingon from the main host but was\nunable to kill Fingon until another Balrog appeared behind the Ñoldor\n“cast a throng of steel about him”. This allowed Gothmog to slay Fingon\nand beat the body to dust. Thereafter, he captured Húrin, father of\nTúrin Turambar, and dragged him back to Angband. In FA 510, Gothmog and\nthe forces of Angband beseiged the Hidden City of Gondolin. They held\nthe northern gates and were later confronted by Ecthelion of the\nFountain, whom Gothmog dueled. Knocking Ecthelion's sword out of his\nhands, Gothmog prepared to strike at him but, as he raised his axe,\nEcthelion ran forward at the Balrog lord, ramming his pointed helmet\ninto the beast's chest and forcing both of them into the Fountain of the\nKing. The waters quenched the flames of Gothmog that kept him alive and\ndrowned Ecthelion, ending the Battle of Gondolin. Etymology The name\n_Gothmog_ is from the Quenyan terms _gos_ or _goth_ (“dread”) and\n_-mbaw_ (“compel, force, subject, oppress”). Gothmog's Quenya name was\nOSOMBAUKO (or OÞOMBAUKO; IPA: or Vanyarin ). His name in Sindarin means\n“Strife and Hate”. Other versions of the legendarium Gothmog was briefly\nconceived as a “son of Melkor and the ogress Fuithluin”, and went by the\nname of KOSOMOT. The root of the name _moko_ translates to “hate”. There\nwas another concept of the Children of the Ainur, Melkor had a son\nKosomot (later Gothmog) with an ogress called Fuithluin. Gallery",

    "page_id": "4885",
    "text": "ECTHELION, or ECTHELION OF THE FOUNTAIN, was a mighty lord of Gondolin\nduring the First Age of Middle-earth, and one of its greatest heroes.\nBiography Early life Most of Ecthelion's early life is unknown but he\nmight have lived in Aman in Tirion and might have been one of the\nfollowers of Fingolfin.He passed through the dangerous Helcaraxe and\nlived. After he survived the grinding ice, he settled in Vinyamar in\nNevrast before moving to Gondolin in FA 116. He later became lord of the\nhouse of the fountain. Aredhel's Escort Two hundred years after Gondolin\nwas wrought, Ecthelion, Glorfindel and Egalmoth, along with the White\nLady of the Ñoldor left the Hidden City due to Aredhel's yearning for\nthe freedom she once had in Valinor. Their orders were to lead her\ntowards Hithlum, where she would meet her elder brother Fingon. When\ncoming upon the Ford of Brithiach, Aredhel ordered them to turn south,\nfor she desired to see the Sons of Fëanor. Thus, Ecthelion and his\ncompanions sought admittance to Doriath, but the wardens refused them\nentrance inside the Girdle of Melian. Having no other choice, they took\nthe dangerous road between the haunted valleys of Ered Gorgoroth. Near\nNan Dungortheb, the Valley of Dreadful Death, the riders were caught in\na mesh of shadows and they were lost from Aredhel. In vain, they sought\nher afterwards, but the fell offspring of Ungoliant that dwelt in that\nplace pursued them. Barely escaping alive, the three lords returned to\nGondolin without the princess, where they were received in sorrow. A\nLord of Gondolin In the year, FA 473 Ecthelion fought alongside Turgon\nin the battle Nirnaeth Arnoediad, leading a wing of Gondolin's forces.\nUpon the defeat of the Ñoldor, he defended a flank as Turgon retreated.\nTwenty-three years after Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Tuor and Voronwë of\nGondolin traveled towards the Hidden City. After being led by Elemmakil\nthrough the Seven Gates, Ecthelion appeared before them as Warden of the\nGreat Gate. Ecthelion initially denied passage for Tuor but when Tuor\nmade a reference towards Ulmo, the Lord of the Waters, Ecthelion\neventually allowed him entry. He was the leader of the House of the\nFountain, one of the Twelve Houses of the Gondolindrim. His people were\nfond of diamonds and silver, their array was most beautiful to the\nsight. In FA 510 during the Fall of Gondolin, Ecthelion led his house\ninto battle accompanied by the music of their flutes and great were the\ndamages caused to the enemy by their long, bright swords. Warcry of the\nEldar In the battle over Gondolin, Ecthelion and his forces made their\nentrance from the South part of the city, after previously being held in\nreserve. So terrible was his voice when commanding the drawing of the\nswords and the killings, which followed, that his name became a terror\namong the enemy and a Warcry to the Eldar. Valiantly fighting side by\nside with Tuor and his House of the Wing, they drove away the orcs until\nalmost the Gate was regained. As Dragons reinforced Morgoth's army,\nEcthelion killed three Balrogs and his sword did “hurt to their fire”.\nOutnumbered, they had to retreat. When doing so, Ecthelion's left arm\nwas wounded and his shield fell to earth. Tuor carried him away as they\njoined the remaining leaders in the Square of the King. In that place,\nthe great Fountain of the King stood and Ecthelion regained his strength\nby drinking from it. As seven dragons lead the enemy's forces towards\nthe Square, the remaining army of Gondolin began retreat. All but\nEcthelion, who remained near the fountain in a stand, which was\nremembered as the most valiant “in all the songs or in any tale”. It was\nthere that he faced Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs. Bane of Gothmog Tuor tried\nto stand in the way of Gothmog, but he was thrown aside. Then Ecthelion,\nfairest of the Ñoldor, but whose face now had the pallor of grey steel,\ndueled him. Losing his sword due to a wound received he was unable to\nprotect himself. Just as Gothmog was about to deliver the finishing\nblow, Ecthelion jumped and wrapped his legs around the demon, driving\nthe spike of his helmet into Gothmog's body. This caused Gothmog to lose\nhis balance, and he, along with Ecthelion, fell into the Fountain of the\nKing. Gothmog's fire was thus quenched, but Ecthelion also drowned with\nhim and found his death in cool waters, whose lord he was. Later, a\nyoung Eärendil asked about him, saying that he wished Ecthelion were\nthere, “to play to me on his flute, or make me willow whistles!\nPerchance has he gone on ahead?” After he was informed of Ecthelion's\ndeath, he “wept bitterly” and said that he cared no more to see the\nstreets of Gondolin. Weapons Although it was never confirmed, it is\nlargely believed that Ecthelion is the original owner of Orcrist. If so,\nit is interesting due to the fact that Orcrist and its mate Glamdring\nkilled the two most famous Balrogs of all time - Glamdring later killing\nDurin's Bane, and Orcrist Gothmog. If this is true, then it is also\ncurious that all combatants died during the Balrog battle. Etymology\nThere are three different sources that offer a translation of ECTHELION\nand they all differ substantially. - In _The Book of Lost Tales 2_\nAppendix, it is said that the name derives from the Quenya _ehtelë_\n(“issue of water, spring”), a reference to his title as Lord for the\nHouse of the Fountain. - In the etymologies of _The Lost Road and Other\nWritings_, his name is composed from _ehtë_, (“spear”) and _thela_,\n(“point”) (of spear). Put together they would translate as “Spear-point”\nor “Spear-head”. - In _The War of the Jewels_, which seems to be the\nlast matter J.R.R. Tolkien wrote on it, the name is derived from _aeg_,\n(“sharp”) and _thel_, (“intent, resolve”). This would translate “one of\nsharp resolve”. Other versions of the legendarium Perhaps the earliest\nJ.R.R. Tolkien writing, _The Fall of Gondolin_ was written during a\nleave of absence from the World War I, in the year 1916. It is in that\nstory, published posthumously by Christopher Tolkien in the volume _The\nBook of Lost Tales 2_ that Ecthelion first appears. Thus, he is one of\nthe first characters Tolkien ever created. However, from a chronological\npoint of view, the first account of his presence is the chapter _Of\nMaeglin_ from _The Silmarillion_. The events described here took place\nmore than one hundred and fifty years before those of Gondolin's fall.\nAlong with Glorfindel of Gondolin and Egalmoth, he was assigned by\nTurgon as Aredhel's escort on her ill-fated journey. Though no name is\nmentioned, only that “Turgon appointed three lords of his household”, an\nexplanatory note in the volume _The War of the Jewels_, chapter called\nMaeglin, sheds light on the escorts' identities.

The armament was possibly the greatest armament in the\nhistory of Arda at the time until perhaps the days of the Last Alliance\nover one-hundred years later.

History The family began as\nthe OLDBUCK clan, who named themselves such apparently after a _Bucca of\nthe Marish_, who became the first Thain of the Shire. Ten Oldbuck Thains\nfollowed, until _Gordenhad Oldbuck_, the eleventh Thain, crossed into\nBuckland over the river Brandywine, passing the Thainship to the Took\nclan. Gordenhad renamed himself BRANDYBUCK, and began delving the great\nsmials of Brandy Hall. Around the hill was built the village of\n_Bucklebury_. The Brandybucks formed a powerful dynasty, which became\nmostly independent of the Shire, although Buckland remained nominally a\npart of it. They were seen as 'odd folk' by the other Hobbits of the\nShire because they locked their doors at night (because of the exposure\nto the Old Forest). It should also be noted that the Brandybucks were\nnot only the most wary hobbit clan, but also one of the most organized\nin matters of militia. After the Ringwraiths invaded Frodo's house in\nBuckland, the militia was roused with the call of “Fear, Fire, Foes,\nAwake!” the militia of Buckland arrived, though the Ringwraiths escaped\nby riding through the front barricades of Buckland. This proves that the\nBrandybucks were not idle in matters of defense, perhaps due to their\nproximity to the Old Forest, and the attack of the White Wolves over the\nfrozen Brandywine River. Two instances in which the Brandybucks were\ncapable of fending off the rare (Though Minor) dangers that threatened\nthe shire. Masters of Buckland The head of the family was the _Master of\nBuckland_, one of the officials of the Shire. Gordenhad Brandybuck\nfounded this office. Like the Thain and Warden of Westmarch, the Master\nhad only nominal authority. The authority of the Master also extended\nacross the Brandywine into the Marish of the Eastfarthing, due to the\nclose proximity and the amount of business between the two areas.\n“Brandybuck” as a translation It should be noted that the name\n_Brandybuck_ is only a translation of the original Westron BRANDAGAMBA,\n_Marchbuck_. In keeping with the concept that _The Lord of the Rings_\nwas derived from the translated Red Book of Westmarch, Tolkien\ntranslated all its Westron words into English — including the names of\ncharacters.

The thrones of the King and the Steward of Gondor\nwere inside the tower, and Denethor II in the Third Age secretively kept\nhis Palantir in the uppermost story. Description The White Tower had\ngraced the highest point of Minas Tirith since ancient times. The Tower\nof Ecthelion was used to bear the plain white standard of the Stewards\nof Gondor of the City, which flew from its pinnacle, and—at least during\nthe last years of the Third Age. It is 50 fathoms (300 feet) tall. The\nTower stood in the center of the Citadel on the seventh level of the\ncity. In front of the Tower was the Place of the Fountain where the\nWhite Tree of Gondor grew. In the Tower Hall was the throne of the King\nof Gondor upon a dais, and at the foot the dais on the lowest step was a\nblack chair where the Steward of Gondor would sit. There was a chamber\nhigh in the Tower and above it in the summit there was a secret room\nwhere the Palantír of Minas Anor, called the _Anor-stone_, was kept.\nBelow the Hall was the buttery of Beregond's company, where the Citadel\nGuard (which Pippin became) would stay when not on duty. History King\nCalimehtar first built the White Tower in TA 1900 in order to house the\nPalantír. In TA 2698, the Tower was repaired and rebuilt by the Steward\nEcthelion I, some three centuries before the War of the Ring, and for\nwhom the Tower came to be named. The elite military unit in Minas Tirith\nwas called the Guard of the Citadel or the Guard of the Tower. At the\ntime of the War of the Ring, Boromir and Faramir - the sons of the\nSteward of Gondor - each bore the title Captain of the White Tower.\nBoromir, the Steward's heir, was also the High Warden of the White\nTower. On March 9, 3019, Peregrin Took got his first glimpse of the\nTower of Ecthelion as he rode with Gandalf to Minas Tirith: _Then Pippin\ncried aloud, for the Tower of Ecthelion, standing high within the\ntopmost wall, shone out against the sky, glimmering like a spike of\npearl and silver, tall and fair and shapely, and its pinnacle glittered\nas if it were wrought of crystals; and white banners broke and fluttered\nfrom the battlements in the morning breeze, and high and far he heard a\nclear ringing as of silver trumpets._ -The Return of the King: chapter\n1,“Minas Tirith” Pippin met Denethor II, the Steward of Gondor, in the\nTower Hall. Denethor's son Faramir came to the Tower Hall the next day,\nand Pippin and Gandalf learned of his encounter with Frodo and Sam in\nIthilien. When Faramir was brought back to the city gravely wounded on\nMarch 13, Denethor retreated to his chamber high in the Tower with his\nson and would not come down. In the secret chamber of the Tower,\nDenethor looked into the _Palantír_ and saw images manipulated by Sauron\nthat caused him to despair. After the War of the Ring on May 1, 3019,\nthe standard of the Stewards of Gondor was raised for the last time.\nThat day Aragorn was crowned King and when he entered the Citadel; the\nstandard of the Kings of Gondor bearing the White Tree and the Stars was\nunfurled on the pinnacle of the Tower of Ecthelion.

Each member of the Fellowship was given a\npersonal gift. History For Frodo Baggins - _The Light of Eärendil_ - A\nsmall crystal bottle of liquid, it contains the light of Eärendil's star\nin the water of Galadriel's fountain. The phial emits a brilliant light\nin darkness. For Samwise Gamgee - ''Earth from Galadriel's Orchard and a\nMallorn Seed ''- These are contained in a small box of grey wood with a\nsilver G-rune on the lid. He uses it to replant trees in the Shire after\nthe Scouring of the Shire. In the movie, Sam instead receives Elven\nrope. This rope is much stronger than other rope. In the movie, as in\nthe book, the rope allows itself to be retrieved from its anchorage with\na small tug, due to the Elvish skill at rope-making. For Meriadoc\nBrandybuck and Peregrin Took - _Silver Belt with Gold Flower-Shaped\nClasp_ - a belt favoured by the Elves of Lothlorien. In the movie,\nGaladriel presents them with daggers. For Aragorn - _Elven Scabbard_- A\nmagical scabbard, any sword sheathed in this scabbard will never break.\nAnd _Elessar the Elfstone_ - A green gem set in a silver eagle shaped\nbrooch, left for him by Arwen. In the movie, Aragorn does not receive\neither of these, as Arwen has already given him the film's equivalent\ngem; Elrond will later present him a scabbard with Andúril, though no\nindication is given that it is magical. Instead, Celeborn gives him a\ncurved Elvish hunting knife. For Legolas - _Bow of the Galadhrim with\nArrows_ - A great bow crafted deep in Lothlorien and strung with\nelf-hair. For Gimli - _Three Strands of Galadriel's hair_ - Overwhelmed\nby Galadriel's great beauty, Gimli could think of nothing else he wanted\nbut a single strand of her hair. Galadriel gave him three. Gimli wished\nto encase this gift in imperishable crystal, as an heirloom of his house\nand a sign of good will between the Dwarves and Elves. For Boromir - A\nsolid gold belt crafted in Lórien, shaped like linked golden leaves. For\nall the Fellowship of the Ring (characters) - _Elven Cloaks_ - It is\nworth note that The Fellowship received Elven cloaks from Galadriel\nwhich helped hide them from unfriendly eyes. The cloaks were personally\nwoven by Galadriel and her maidens. The brooches were in the form of a\ngreen leaf veined with silver. The only notable exception to those who\ndidn't receive a cloak was Gandalf, who at the time, was presumed dead\nat the hands of Durin's Bane. In the film, after defeating the Balrog\nand returning to the world of the living, Gandalf appears in Fangorn\nwith a brooched cloak, implying that he traveled to Lorien before\njoining up with scattered members of the Fellowship."

History The namesake\nof this island was derived from the long shape of the isle, which was\nboat-like in nature, and the effects of the water breaking upon what was\nseen as the prow of the ship.  The island was around ten miles in\nlength, and narrowed toward its northern end, creating the prow.  Cair\nAndros was one of the main sites used to cross the river Anduin, along\nwith Osgiliath to the south.  As the northern parts of the river were\nnearly impassable marshland, and the south of the river near Lebennin\nbecame too wide to ford safely, these two locations were critical to\nboth Gondor and Mordor during the war. Cair Andros had a steady\ngarrison, and was well-maintained until the outbreak of the War of the\nRing; military incursions were expected both here and at Osgiliath, but\nthe southern crossing was considered by Denethor II to be of more\nimportance, and therefore was more heavily guarded.  Being a vital point\nin Gondorian defenses, a crucial river junction, and due to the fact\nthat it was less manned than was Osgiliath, shortly before the Battle of\nthe Pelennor Fields, Sauron sent a force of orcs and Easterlings from\nthe Morannon to lay siege to the fort, and the island was overrun in the\nBattle of Cair Andros.  Around the time of the fall of Osgiliath,\nfugitives began arriving at Minas Tirith from Cair Andros. Aragorn,\nduring his march toward the Black Gate, sent soldiers to reclaim the\nisland for Gondor; these soldiers were young men of Rohan and\nLossarnach, and were eventually successful in their quest to retake the\nisland.  After the fall of Sauron and the conclusion of the war, the\nisland continued to serve as a vital place of crossing, and the Captains\nof the West set sail from Cair Andros on their way down the Anduin to\nOsgiliath.   de:Cair Andros es:Cair Andros it:Cair Andros pl:Cair Andros\nru:Каир Андрос"

Tolkien gives no hint to the\nhistory of the cold-drakes after this time period. Four hundred years\nlater, at the time of Bilbo Baggins' journey to Erebor, they seem to\nhave left the Grey Mountains (as implied by Gandalf making no mention of\nthem when describing the dangers of that region). Speculations - Some of\ntheories for origin(s) of dragons claim that morphology of cold-drakes\nmay be similar to that of 'dragons' before dragons.   - They may have\nbeen animals originally created by Yavanna (and therefore the first\ndragons) that were then used by Morgoth to breed the much stronger and\nmore wicked Uruloki.   - Land-crawling dragons are sometimes considered\nphysically more powerful than their flying kin by some fans. Some of\ncold-drakes whose fire-breathing ability did not degenerate as much as\n'true' ones, could possibly use breaths of vapor mist or smoke, and\nmagical arts such as “death glance” utilized by Gostir (a speculation\nfrom the drake's name etymology).   - What caused cold-drakes to lose\nthe ability to breath fire is unclear. It might have been due to\nunnecessary to inherit such means of destruction to consume lots of\nenergy after being freed from restraints under Morgoth's rule, or to\nhide them from Valar and High Elves after surviving War of Wrath.\nSelection of capabilities to survive is a common phenomenon among real\norganisms. de:Kaltdrachen ru:Холодные драконы"

The position of Shirriff was a\nvoluntary honor. There were a total of twelve Shirriffs, three for each\nFarthing, though more could be called up in time of need (as happened\naround TA 3001). The only thing that differentiated Shirriffs from other\nHobbits was a feather they were given to wear in their hats. The\nShirriffs carried no arms or armament of any sort and wore no uniform.\nThe Shirriffs were headed by the First Shirriff which was answerable to\nthe Mayor of Michel Delving. History The Shirriffs were probably based\non some form of ancient tradition, possibly dating back to the Kingdom\nof Arnor. But as the Shire was a peaceful place, their only purpose was\nprotecting the Shire from trespassers. They were also possibly\nresponsible for deputizing hobbits into the Bounders service who\npatrolled the borders. When Lotho Sackville-Baggins ruled the Shire\nunder Saruman during the War of the Ring, he took personal control of\nthe Shirriffs service under the title “Chief Shirriff”. The Shirriffs\nwere increased in number, many against their will, and those that\nalready were appointed couldn't quit; but some liked it or even signed\nup, and organized into troops or companies such as the First\nEastfarthing Troop and supported by the Ruffians. The Shirriffs were\nalso armed far more heavily than previously. Their orders during these\ntroubled times were to arrest anyone who broke the rules. When the Shire\nwas freed by the return of Frodo and company, the Shirriffs were\nreturned to their original numbers and purpose. Etymology The term\n_Shirriff_ is most likely based upon “Shire Reeve”, the Anglo-Saxon term\nthat eventually gave rise to the word “Sheriff” in modern English. Shire\nbeing analogous to “county” and “reeve” being an English term for an\nappointed official who represents a landlord.

Glaurung was a key player in the\nsacking of Nargothrond and in the fulfillment of Morgoth's curse on the\nchildren of Húrin. He was a fearsome bane to the Elves. Ancalagon and\nhis armada of winged fire-drakes by themselves drove back the Host of\nthe Valar during the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age, such was\ntheir incredible power. Fire-drakes also joined the Balrogs in the\nattack on Gondolin. Second and Third Ages All fire-drakes were thought\nto have been slain before the Second Age, but some including Smaug the\nGolden survived; and in TA 2770,he descended from the North and sacked\nthe Lonely Mountain. Later, in TA 2941 Thrór's grandson Thorin\nOakenshield returned with a small group to reclaim his grandfather's\nkingdom, unleashing a chain of events that led to the death of Smaug\nwhen he attacked nearby Lake-town and was slain by the Black Arrow shot\nby Bard the Bowman. According to Gandalf, there were still fire-drakes\njust before the beginning of War of the Ring. Attributes These creatures\nare described by Tolkien as being more like giant scaled serpents with\nwings than dragons as commonly depicted today. Fire-drakes often grew to\nimmense size. The fire from one of these dragons was so intense that it\nwas said the great dragons could consume and melt the Rings of Power (as\nbecame the case with some of hte Dwarven Rings), with the exception of\nthe One Ring. Most of the famous dragons throughout the ages were\nfire-drakes, although only some of them fought for Morgoth.

However in The History of The Hobbit, Tolkien set 19\nOctober as the Durin's Day. That would place the beginning of winter for\nthe Dwarves of Erebor at the beginning of November.

    "page_id": "5728",
    "text": "The DAGOR DAGORATH or “FINAL BATTLE” is the end-times event described\nand alluded to in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. The published\n_Silmarillion_ ends with the recounting of the voyage of Eärendil the\nMariner, but this is due to an editorial decision by Christopher\nTolkien. The _Silmarillion_ as Tolkien originally wrote it ends with a\nprophecy by Mandos about the Dagor Dagorath, often referred to as “THE\nEND”. The remaining clue to this prophecy is found at the end of\nAkallabêth, where \"Ar-Pharazôn and his mortal warriors who had set foot\nin Aman were buried by falling hills, imprisoned in the Caves of the\nForgotten until the “LAST BATTLE AND DAY OF DOOM”. The account is\nclearly inspired by and bears many similarities to the Norse legend of\nRagnarök, but also that of the Biblical Armageddon. It is important to\nnote that the final, published version of the ''Silmarillion ''contains\nno direct references to this prophecy (though there are still indirect\nreferences including the 'Last Battle', 'Day of Doom' and 'end of days'.\nTom Bombadil once referred to this future time as when “the world is\nmended”, in a song. Doom of Melkor In later writings of Tolkien's, it\nbecomes apparent that Melkor was not merely bound, but unhoused, after\nhis final capture, being “beheaded” and thus “killed”; that is, the body\nto which he had become so bound towards was destroyed, after which\nexecution his spirit, still bound with the enchanted chain Angainor, was\ncast out through the Door of Night. His “will” is spoken of as an active\nforce in the world, tempting and urging in thought, and sometimes in\nphantom manifestation. The Second Prophecy of Mandos “Thus spoke Mandos\nin prophecy, when the Valar sat in judgement in Valinor and the rumour\nof his word was whispered among all the Elves of the West. When the\nworld is old and the Powers have grown weary, Morgoth, the Black Foe of\nthe World, seeing that the guard sleepeth, shall come back through the\nDoor of the Night out of the Timeless Void; and all shall be darkness,\nfor the sun he will turn to black, and the moon will no longer shed his\nlight.. But the Host of Valinor shall descend upon him as a searing\nflame, white and terrible. Then shall the Last Battle be gathered on the\nfields of Valinor. In that day, Tulkas shall strive with Morgoth, and on\nhis right hand shall be Eönwë, and on his left Túrin Turambar, son of\nHúrin, returning from the Doom of Men at the ending of the world; and\nthe black sword of Túrin shall deal unto Morgoth his death and final\nend; and so shall the Children of Húrin and all fallen Men be avenged.”\n“Thereafter shall the Earth be broken and remade, and the Silmarils\nshall be recovered out of Air and Earth and Sea; for Feanor shall\nsurrender them willingly Yavanna will rekindle the Two Trees, and a\ngreat light shall come forth. And the mountains of Valinor shall be\nlevelled, so that the light shall go out over all the world. In that\nlight the Valar will grow young again, and the Elves awake and all their\ndead arise, and the purpose of Ilúvatar be fulfilled concerning them.\nBut of Men in that day the prophecy of Mandos doth not speak, and no Man\nit names, save Túrin only, and to him a place is given among the sons of\nthe Valar.” - The Later Quenta Silmarillion (History of Middle-earth,\nvolume 11). Battle According to the prophecy, Morgoth will discover how\nto break the Door of Night, and will blacken the Sun and the Moon. For\nthe love of these, Eärendil will return from the sky and shall meet\nTulkas, Manwë, Eönwë (with the old version of his name Fionwe) and Túrin\nTurambar on the plains of Valinor. There the forces of the Valar shall\nfight against Melkor and The Dark Powers. Tulkas will wrestle with\nMorgoth, but it will be by the hand of Túrin that finally death and\ndestruction will be dealt to Melkor. Túrin will run his black sword\nGurthang (Iron of Death) through Melkor's heart, thus avenging the\nChildren of Húrin (Sindarin: _Hîn Húrin_) and all the fallen (In the end\nof _The Hiding of Valinor_ Eönwë, and not Turin, kills Morgoth). Then\nthe three Silmarils will be recovered from the Earth, sea, and sky, then\nFëanor taking them and will break, and with their fire Yavanna will\nrekindle the Two Trees, and a great light shall come forth, and Pelóri\nMountains will be leveled. The battle will end and renew Arda's\nexistence: all the Elves will awaken and the Powers will be young again.\nFollowing this, there will be a Second Music of the Ainur. This song\nwill sing into being a new world. Men and Elves will sing it with the\nAinur. It is unknown what the fate of the old races, or of the old\nworld, will be in the new one. However, It is worth noting that the\nDwarves believe that after the greatest battle of all time, they will\nhelp the Vala, Mahal, rebuild Arda. For though Mandos prophesied it,\neven the Ainur do not know anything of the second world or the Second\nMusic. All the Ainur know is that the Second Music will be greater than\nthe First Music. Notes Christopher Tolkien removed the prophecy from\n_The Silmarillion_ based on a 1958 version of the Valaquenta, wherein\nhis father wrote that none of Mandos' dooms had declared whether the\nMarring of Arda would ever be repaired (Christopher Tolkien adopted this\npassage and used it to close the Quenta Silmarillion). Given this\nremoval of the prophecy Christopher apparently assumed that the Dagor\nDagorath had been removed as well. The published _Silmarillion_\ncontradicts the Second Prophecy in places. Whereas the Second Prophecy\nexplicitly states that the Elves and Valar shall be renewed after Dagor\nDagorath and that the fate of Men is unknown, _The Silmarillion_ states\nthat Men will participate in singing the Second Music, and that it is\nthe fate of the Elves that is unknown. In all of this the Creator, Eru,\nwill retain His sovereignty and nothing Morgoth nor any evil force could\ndo will be able to threaten his plan in any way. As Eru said, “And thou,\nMelkor, shalt see that no theme may be played that hath not its\nuttermost source in me, nor can any alter the music in my despite. For\nhe that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising\nof things more wonderful, which he himself hath not imagined.” Etymology\n_Dagor Dagorath_ was Sindarin for “Battle of Battles”.",

The tale was written by Faramir's\ngrandson Barahir after Aragorn's death. The Tale After his father was\nkilled battling Orcs, Aragorn was sent to live in Rivendell with his\nmother, Gilraen. Around his twentieth year, as he walked in the woods\nsinging a part of the Lay of Lúthien, he witnessed the beauty of Arwen\nfor the first time, clad in a mantle of silver and blue. Mistaking her\nfor Lúthien, he called to her by that name, and, from that moment on,\nloved only her. Gilraen warned Aragorn of the folly of his love for\nArwen, a high-born Elf such as she was. Aragorn soon left Rivendell, and\nfor thirty years fought against Sauron on whatever front which was\ndeemed necessary. In his forty-ninth year of life, after years of strife\nand toil, he wished, once again, to be at peace. He came into Lórien,\nnot knowing that Arwen also was there, and stayed with her for a season.\n“And thus it was that Arwen first beheld him again after their long\nparting; and as he came walking towards her under the trees of Caras\nGaladhon laden with flowers of gold, her choice was made and her doom\nappointed.” On Cerin Amroth, in the midst of Lórien they plighted their\ntroth looking toward the shadow of the east and the twilight of the\nwest. After The War of the Ring, Arwen and Aragorn were married and\nspent six-score years in bliss. As Aragorn felt his life drawing to a\nclose, he came to Arwen, saying, “In sorrow we must go, but not in\ndespair. Behold! we are not bound for ever to the circles of the world,\nand beyond them is more than memory.” After he passed from the world in\nthe House of the Kings, she bid farewell to Eldarion and her daughters,\nand went out of Minas Tirith to Lórien and, “dwelt there alone under the\nfading trees until winter came.” Sometime before the Spring she laid\nherself down upon Cerin Amroth, and there she would lie until the\nworld's ending."

Daeron was inspired by the Tengwar\nscript of Fëanor and wanted to create a new script for his Sindar kin.\nThe dwarves learned the runes from the elves and adapted them for their\nown language Khuzdûl. The letters are thin and angular for they were\ndesigned for cutting or scratching on wood, stone, or metal. By the\nThird Age only the dwarves made regular use of them. The Cirth alphabet\noriginally had nineteen characters which was sufficient for the Sindarin\nlanguage. More were later added by the Noldor of Eregion to make it\neasier to express certain subtle sounds in their language. This full\nexpansion of the script is generally called Angerthas Daeron or\nAngerthas Eregion. After the destruction of Eregion the elves generally\nceased to use Cirth at all. Dwarves made their own variations of the\nscript called Angerthas Moria and Angerthas Erebor. Some dwarves knew a\nsecret way of writing runes called Moon letters. These runes were\nwritten with a silver pen and could only be seen under the light of the\nmoon. With the more advanced forms of Moon letters it had to be a moon\nof the same shape and season as the day when the runes were written.

The\nwaterfall cascading over the cliff-face had originally run through the\ncave itself, but was altered to flow over one of the entrances; this\nlikeness to a window gave Henneth Annûn its name. There are two\nentrances into the cave system- one being the route through which\nSamwise Gamgee and Frodo were led, and the other being the window\nitself. At the bottom of the window was a bowl full of sharp stone\nknives. History Like all of the other hidden refuges of Gondor in\nIthilien, Henneth Annûn was created by the Steward Turin II circa TA\n2900 in response to incursions of Orcs from Mordor. Henneth Annûn was\nthe longest-lasting of all the refuges in Ithilien. During the War of\nthe Ring, Faramir, son of the Steward of Gondor, Denethor II, made it\nhis base of operations. Caught in Ithilien, Frodo Baggins and Samwise\nGamgee were taken there to be questioned by Faramir. Requiring the\nutmost security, the ring-bearer and his servant were blindfolded until\narrival at the lair. Gollum found the Forbidden Pool quite by accident\nwhilst he was diving for fish. The penalty for coming to Henneth Annûn\nwithout permission was death. However, Frodo convinced Faramir to spare\nGollum, and he was also taken to the cave blindfolded. The refuge's\ngarrison departed just after the Ring-bearer, and was used to hold the\nwestern half of Osgiliath against the forces of Minas Morgul.

The river then turned south-west until it met\nwith the Glanduin, forming the fenland called _Nin-in-Eilph_ or\n'Swanfleet'. Beyond this point the combined waters were named Gwathlo.\nHistory The Hoarwell was within the boundaries of Arnor when the realm\nwas founded. In TA 861 when Arnor was dismembered, the river was within\nthe confines of Rhudaur. Sometime around TA 1150, the Stoors came over\nthe Redhorn Pass and settled in the Angle, the land between the Hoarwell\nand the Loudwater. When Angmar became powerful around TA 1300, these\nHobbits moved over the Hoarwell to dwell near Bree.  In May TA 2941,\nThorin and Company crossed the river on the Last Bridge and later on\nthat same day they were waylaid by three trolls - Tom, Bert and William.\nThen, on 11th October TA 3018, Glorfindel the Elf-lord drove back the\nNazgul from the Last Bridge and left a beryl in the mud in the middle of\nthe road to show that the path ahead was safe.

Tolkien used the term\n_goblin_ extensively in _The Hobbit_, and also occasionally in _The Lord\nof the Rings,_ as when the Uruk-hai of Isengard are first described:\n“four goblin-soldiers of greater stature”. A clear illustration that\nTolkien considered goblins and orcs to be the same thing, the former\nword merely being the English translation of the latter, is that in _The\nHobbit_ (the only one of Tolkien's works in which he usually refers to\norcs as _goblins_) Gandalf asks Thorin if he remembers Azog the goblin\nwho killed his grandfather Thror , while in all his other writings\nTolkien describes Azog as a “great Orc”. History and Description When\nMelkor was taken in chains to Valinor, the Orcs and other foul creatures\nwere forced to flee from Angband. Their kingdoms spread throughout many\nmountains of Middle-earth; notable cities include Goblin-town near the\nHigh Pass above Rivendell, the Goblin-capital at Mount Gundabad, and the\nformer Dwarf-kingdom of Moria, as well as those in the service of\nIsengard and Mordor. Technology Even though goblins are portrayed as a\nvery barbaric and tribal race their technology seems to be more advanced\nthan other races in middle earth. In _The Hobbit_, Tolkien describes\ngoblins as having dark technology. In the chapter “Over Hill and Under\nHill” Tolkien states, “It is not unlikely that they invented some of the\nmachines that have since troubled the world, especially the ingenious\ndevices for killing large numbers of people at once, for wheels and\nengines and explosives always delighted them.” Weapons and armor Goblin\nweapons include scimitars, axes, and spears, as well as bows. The great\ngoblin-soldiers of Isengard, the “fighting Uruk-hai”, are distinguished\nby their use of short, straight swords and long bows of yew."

In Middle-earth Dwarves Only seen by some\nof the members of Thorin and Company, in _The Hobbit._ Elves The Elven\narchers from Lórien use large bows of Mallorn wood strung with elf-hair.\nTheir arrows were almost four feet long and usually made of ash with a\ntip made of gold and shaped like a Mallorn leaf. They used a spiral\nmethod of fletching (attaching feathers to the arrow shaft), thus making\ntheir arrows more accurate, up to a quarter mile. Legolas was the most\nrenowned archer throughout the Third Age. Earlier in his journey with\nthe Fellowship of the Ring, he used a bow from Mirkwood, and it was\nlater replaced by the bow of the Galadhrim Lady Galadriel gave him.\nGondorian The Gondorian army contains units of archers who use a\nlongbow. The bows are made of heartwood, about 68 inches tall. The\narrows are about 28 inches long with four-inch steel tips. They are\naccurate up to 200 yards. The longbowmen of the army wear their quiver\n(the case that holds the arrows) on their hips rather than on their\nbacks like most archers, such as Legolas and Haldir. Rangers of Ithilien\nThe Rangers of Ithilien were primarily archers. They used a simple\nlongbow, often made of yew, likely up to 80 inches in length. Their\narrows would have averaged about 28 inches in length with a steel tip\nwith consistent accuracy up to 200 yards. Rohirrim Rohan included\narchers in its militia. They used shortbows, possibly because they\nfought mounted on horses and a longer bow might get in the way. The\nshortbows were much less powerful than those used by their allies,\nhaving probably a range of only 125 yards. Their arrows were unique in\nhaving a cutout in the heads; this cut down on weight & the amount of\nmetal used while still allowing the arrowheads to have a larger surface\narea, which would cause a larger wound. Another unique aspect of the\narrows was that they were fletched with leather. _Note: Information\ncomes from “The Lord of the Rings: Weapons and Warfare” by Chris Smith._\nHaradrim and Easterlings The Haradrim (Southrons) were also skilled\narchers, along with their allies the Easterlings. The Haradrim were\nmasters of archery and had expert snipers positioned on the feared\nMumakil. Their bows were short, possibly made of composite materials and\nby the time of the War of the Ring, could possibly have been compound,\nmaking them extremely deadly. The Easterlings are mentioned several\ntimes in the books as having scores of mounted archers. The horse\narchers were among the deadliest in Middle Earth, far exceeding the\nskill of the Rohirrim and Haradrim. The Easterlings also had many foot\narchers weilding both longbows and recurve bows. Orcs Orcs and Goblins\nwere often seen carrying bows, but are also viewed as poor handlers of\nthe weapon. Their bows can range from being as tall as an Uruk to\nrelatively short. The maximum effective ranges included 50 and 100\nyards. Orc arrows were usually tipped with poison or barbed, so even a\nglancing hit could be fatal. Hobbits The Hobbits were not a warring\npeople, but their best unit in times of war are their archers. During\nthe reign of the last King of Arnor before its dispansion the first\ntime, hobbits sent archers to his aid as was agreed when they moved to\nlive in Arnor. Hobbit archers were also responsible for the death of\nGrima Wormtongue.﻿ Most notable archers - Beleg - Legolas - Bard"

Soldiers that use pikes in battle are called pikemen. Near\nthe pike head it is affixed with metal strips or “cheeks” to hold the\nhead in place. The pike would be unwieldy in close combat. This would\nmean that the wielder would have to have another hand weapon such as a\ndagger, mace or short sword if the battle turned into a toe-to-toe\nmelee. However, they tried to avoid such disorganized combat as a\npikeman would be at a disadvantage. They had either no shield, or a very\nsmall shield that had a strap so they could strap it in their arm,\nsimilar to that of most Macedonian troops. Most pike tactics would\ninvolve the wielder to kneel on one knee and drive the end of the pike\ninto the ground at an angle. This would create a line of pikes\nimpossible to charge at. If the horsemen did charge, the horse would\nkeel at the sight of the wall, and quickly turn away, as horses are\ninnately cautious of bad terrain. The pikes have their own weakness;\nthey are heavy and hard to turn while holding one.

The two towers, called Carchost and\nNarchost, that stand on either side of Cirith Gorgor, the Haunted Pass,\nwhich lies between the Ephel Dúath, and the Ered Lithui. History\nOriginally built by Men of Gondor following the downfall of Sauron at\nthe end of the Second Age, the Towers of the Teeth were eventually taken\nover by the servants of the Dark Lord. They were then repaired and\nfortified and were incorporated into the defenses of the pass and gate.\nTolkien's writings leave it unclear which tower was located on which\nside of the Black Gate. However, Carchost appears to have stood to the\neastern side and Narchost on the western side. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum\nbeheld these towers and the Black Gate between them as they debated the\nbest way to enter Mordor, and it was below these towers that the\nCaptains of the West and their small army made their last stand against\nthe forces of Sauron.

In\nthe middle of Tumladen was a small hill made of smooth stone, called\nafterwards the Amon Gwareth. This stone hill was the foundation for the\ncity Gondolin built by Turgon. Tumladen and the city it contained\nremained secret and safe for 503 years since the Return of the Ñoldor to\nMiddle-earth. It was, however, betrayed by the father of Túrin Turambar,\nHúrin Thalion, when Húrin shouted at the mountains encircling the city\nto let Turgon know to open the gates and let him in (this was an\nill-fated attempt, for no one heard him, and Húrin despaired). As Húrin\nwas under the spell of Morgoth, the Dark Lord finally learned of\nGondolin's location through Húrin. In this way, Húrin doomed the city.\nMorgoth waited for a couple more years before he finally invaded the\ncity, with the help of the traitor Maeglin, who showed him where the\nvale could be found exactly and how it could be attacked (since Great\nEagles guarded its borders). Through his treachery, Maeglin help to lie\nwaste the fair vale of Tumladen and the city that sat on Amon Gwareth in\nthe center of the vale, Gondolin. Description Tumladen was described by\nJ.R.R. Tolkien as a “...green jewel among the encircling hills...” and\nas a “...green plain among the mountains.” He also describes it as being\nvery fair with the black and smooth Amon Gwareth in the center of the\nvale. History Tumladen was a great lake in the ancient days of\nBeleriand. It was located east of the upper waters of Sirion, as was\nfound out later by the Elves, in the middle of the Encircling Mountains.\nTurgon was shown by Ulmo, a Vala, where it was located by means of a\ndark tunnel that ran deep under the mountains, hollowed out by streams\nthat ran to join the Sirion. In this way, Turgon discovered the vale of\nTumladen, and thought it indeed to be a perfect place to construct his\ncity that was supposed to be modeled after the great city of Tirion upon\nthe green hill Tuna, back in Valinor. Indeed, after many years of labor,\nGondolin did come to rival Tirion with its beauty and splendor. As\nmentioned above, Tumladen and the city it held, Gondolin, survived for\nmore than 503 years, the longest lasting of the Ñoldorin kingdoms. The\nvale was betrayed, as mentioned above, by Maeglin and in so doing,\nMaeglin finally destroyed the last kingdom of the Ñoldor in Beleriand.\nIt was there that the battle of Ecthelion of the Fountain and Gothmog,\nthe Lord of Balrogs, took place in the very square of the King. There it\nwas also that they slew each other, and in so doing, Ecthelion had\nfelled the mightiest of Balrogs, even though he himself had died also.\nAnd so, with the treachery of Maeglin, the fair vale of Tumladen and the\ncity upon Amon Gwareth, Gondolin, the last kingdom of the Ñoldor, were\ndestroyed and ruined. Etymology _Tumladen_ is a name coming from two\nSindarin roots. One of the roots is _tum_ (pronounced _toom_), which\nmeans a valley. The other Sindarin root is _lad_, which means a plain or\na valley. Both parts of this name doubly imply and tell that Tumladen is\na plain/valley, a very interesting combination of Sindarin roots on the\npart of Tolkien. Other In the Third Age, Tumladen was a valley near the\nsoutheastern end of the White Mountains. When Pippin arrived in Minas\nTirith, he saw vehicles carrying the old, the children and the women to\ntake refuge in Lebennin through the vales Tumladen, Lossarnach, and the\nmountain-villages. Tumladen was placed at the source of River Sirith in\n_The Atlas of Middle-earth_."

Those present at this\ncouncil were people who were of the three largest races of good in\nMiddle-earth: Men, Elves, and Dwarves. Synopsis During the Council, the\nfull story of the Ring was told by Bilbo and Gandalf. Elrond and the\nothers agreed that this was indeed the One Ring, based on evidence\nprovided by Gandalf. Gandalf related his meeting with Saruman and\nsubsequent imprisonment by the traitor in Orthanc. Boromir described the\ndream he and his brother Faramir had experienced, and which led him to\ncome to Rivendell. He pleaded that the Ring should be used to aid Gondor\nin her struggle against Mordor, but was told that it would inevitably\ncorrupt anyone who used it. Only a mighty person could hope to wield the\nRing against Sauron, and they would in time become a new Dark Lord\nwhether they wished it or not. Boromir reluctantly accepted this\nconclusion. Glóin, Gimli's father, spoke of evil messengers who had come\nto the Lonely Mountain promising the return of one or more of the Seven\nrings if they would reveal the location of Bilbo Baggins. The\npossibility of war with Sauron's allies in the region was troubling, but\nGandalf was relieved that at least Smaug the dragon was no longer around\nfor the Dark Lord to use. They had also came seeking news of what\nhappened to Balin, who went to Moria in TA 2989 with Ori and Óin.\nLegolas conveyed the bad news that Gollum had escaped captivity and\ndisappeared. Aragorn had gone to great lengths to capture the debased\ncreature, who had possessed the Ring for centuries under the Misty\nMountains. After his capture, Aragorn and Gandalf had interrogated the\nmiserable Gollum, and found to their dismay that he had been to Mordor.\nApparently, while under torment there, Gollum had confessed both that he\nhad held the One Ring and that Bilbo had taken it to the Shire. After\nmuch debate about the fate of the Ring, it was decided that the only way\nto be free of Sauron's evil was to cast the Ring into the Cracks of Doom\nin Mount Doom (in Mordor), where it would be unmade. This might well\nundo the power of the three Elf-rings, but would certainly render Sauron\nimpotent and free Middle-earth from his menace forever. Tom Bombadil was\nalso mentioned as a possible ring bearer since the ring took no effect\non him, but Gandalf stated that Tom would most likely lose it as Tom\nseemed to be very nonchalant about the War of the Ring. It then became\nnecessary to decide who should take responsibility for such a perilous\nundertaking. Bilbo offered to finish the job he had started, but Gandalf\ntold him he could not take back the Ring. Frodo surprised everyone\n(including himself) by announcing that he would take the Ring, and after\nsome thought Elrond agreed. At this point Sam emerged from hiding and\ndemanded to accompany Frodo, and since it was hardly possible to\nseparate them Elrond agreed. The matter of who else should accompany\nFrodo (later to be known as the Fellowship of the Ring, hence the title\nof the book and subsequent movie) was decided later, although the movie\nversion of _The Fellowship of the Ring_ depicts the choosing of the\nFellowship as taking place at the end of the Council, and has Merry and\nPippin also eavesdropping on the proceedings and demanding to accompany\nFrodo. Present individuals Those present at the Council had arrived at\nRivendell by different paths and on separate errands, yet they were all\nultimately concerned with the Ring and its effect upon the people of\nMiddle-earth. Important participants at the Council were: - Elrond - a\nHalf-elven conveyor, member of White Council and lord of Rivendell. -\nErestor - an Elf-lord, advisor, and the chief of the House of Elrond. -\nGandalf the Grey - a Wizard, one of the Istari, and member of both the\nWhite Council and The Fellowship. - Aragorn - a Ranger, heir of Isildur,\nmember of The Fellowship, and Chieftain of the Dúnedain in the North. -\nFrodo Baggins - a Hobbit of the Shire, member of The Fellowship, and\nRing-bearer. - Bilbo Baggins - a Hobbit of the Shire, former\nRing-bearer, uncle of Frodo and long resident in Rivendell. - Boromir of\nGondor - son of Denethor II Ruling Steward of Minas Tirith, and member\nof The Fellowship. - Glóin of the Lonely Mountain - representative of\nthe King under the Mountain, Dain Ironfoot of the Dwarves. - Gimli - son\nof Gloin, member of The Fellowship, and dwarf of the Lonely Mountain. -\nLegolas - a Sindar Elf of the Woodland Realm (Mirkwood), son of\nThranduil the Elvenking, and member of The Fellowship. - Glorfindel - an\nElf-lord of Rivendell, rescuer of Frodo and his company from the Nine. -\nGaldor of the Havens - messenger from Círdan of the Grey Havens."

Bilbo Baggins\nmade one of his renowned long speeches under this tree upon his leaving\nof the Shire. After the War of the Ring, Sam Gamgee returned to the\nShire in November 3019 to find the tree had been felled by Saruman's\norders and abandoned in the middle of the field. The tree was removed\nafter the Scouring of the Shire, and in place of the original tree, Sam\nplanted a silver nut given to him by the Lady Galadriel. Spring TA\n3020 brought the first sapling of a Mallorn tree out of Shire soil. It\nwas the only Mallorn outside the great forest of Lothlórien, and people\nboth Men _and_ Elves came from miles around to gaze upon it.

    "text": "_'Lake-town, OR Esgaroth_', known fully as “ESGAROTH UPON THE LONG\nLAKE”, was a small settlement and community of Men in the north-western\npart of the Long Lake in the Rhovanion. The town was constructed\nentirely of wood and stands upon wooden pillars sunk into the bed of the\nLong Lake, south of the Lonely Mountain and east of Mirkwood. It seems\nthat the town's prosperity was built on trade between the Men, Elves and\nDwarves of northern Middle-earth. It was also known as the final resting\nplace of the Dragon Smaug, whose bones ended up at the bottom of the\nlake, and by whom it was destroyed. History Lake-town may have been\nseparate settlements established on the same site, one predating Smaug's\ndestruction of Dale and the Lonely Mountain in TA 2770 and the other\nbuilt afterwards. Uniquely, of all of the towns, settlements,\nfortresses, and cities of Middle-earth, Lake-town utilized water as its\ndefense. The Long Lake was also surrounded by towering cliffs and high\nmountains, all helpful natural barriers that had the potential to aid\nits defenders in a siege (such as the Easterling invasion of the North\nin TA 3018). While these defenses slowed and diverted Lake-town's human\nenemies, it did nothing to prepare its inhabitants against Smaug. The\nvillagers would be harassed on a regular basis by Smaug. Smaug would\nsteal an occasional maiden or just burn down their homes. Lake-town was\nfounded sometime during the Third Age and its inhabitants traded\nextensively with the Elves of Thranduil's Woodland Realm, the Dwarves of\nthe Lonely Mountain and the Iron Hills, their kin in Dale and Dorwinion\nto the south, and possibly with the Easterlings (in times of peace, of\ncourse). The Men of Lake-town traded with Dorwinion (a human realm on\nthe fertile coastal plain on the west shore of the Sea of Rhûn) in a\nunique way; wine barrels were floated down from Thranduil's caverns in\nMirkwood (the Elves were known as copious wine drinkers, as found in the\nHobbit) along the Celduin down to Lake-town, where they were redirected\nto Dorwinion. The wine was then paid for and filled with the necessary\ngoods before being shipped back north, and the cycle of trade resumed\nonce more. These barrels were also quite large, for they could fit a\nHobbit or Dwarf (even the extremely fat Bombur). It is also where Bilbo\nand the Dwarves travelled in their adventure to reclaim the Lonely\nMountain. In the year TA 2941 of the Third Age the town was attacked by\nthe dragon, but Bard the Bowman, who had indirectly learned of a\nweakness in Smaug's armor that had first been noticed by Bilbo Baggins,\nslew the dragon. Smaug, livid with bestial fury, had winged his way to\nthe town in the dead of night and promptly began to immolate the wooden\nmatchwood structures there, materials that burst into flame at the\nslightest provocation. Its inhabitants realized all too late their\npredicament and while some, including most of the women and children,\ngot away safely on boats, many perished in the maelstrom of fire that\nensued. A brave company of spearmen and archers attempted, in vain, to\nshoot down the dragon, but were mostly immolated themselves. It wasn't\nuntil Bard managed to kill the dragon, that the destruction finally\nended. The town was wrecked by the dragon, but afterwards it was rebuilt\nusing some of the treasure that Smaug had stolen, though the town's\nMaster ran off with some of the Gold. Part of the town's population\nfollowed Bard to resettle the Kingdom of Dale. As trading people, the\nMen of Lake-town knew the Common Speech, Westron. However, amongst\nthemselves they spoke an ancient form of it, which was loosely related\nto but distinct from the also ancient language of the Rohirrim. Tolkien\n“translated” Westron into English in his text, so to represent its\nancient relative that the Rohirrim spoke he substituted Old English.\nThus, Tolkien substituted Old Norse for the language of the Men of\nEsgaroth (in person and place names, etc.) because it is an ancient\nrelative of English that is related to Old English. After the town's\nnear destruction following Smaug's rage, its inhabitants rebuilt it with\nmore splendor and grandeur further down the lake. LAKE-TOWN is used to\nrefer to the pre-Smaug town upon the Long Lake, while the rebuilt,\nlarger cousin further down the waterway is referred to as ESGAROTH. The\ninhabitants also learned a crucially important, but painful, lesson\nbought with the blood of loved ones: the town was built to be less\nsusceptible to flame and its military was expanded. These lessons\ngreatly aided it during the War of the Ring.",

The land's name was inspired by\nUngoliant, who resided there after escaping the Balrogs of Morgoth and\nLammoth.

The\nregion was a perilous land of fear to travel through, as the waters were\npolluted by the darkness produced from the webs of Ungoliant's children,\nand because of the chaos caused by the conflicting powers of Ungoliant's\ndemonic offspring, Sauron's malevolent sorcery, and the maze-like\ndefenses of the Girdle of Melian.

    "title": "Gift of Men",
    "page_id": "7687",
    "text": "The GIFT OF MEN refers to a gift of Ilúvatar to his Younger Children,\nwhich remains a source of some confusion for Tolkien enthusiasts. The\nconcept includes both mortality, leading to death of old age, and free\nwill. Below are two interpretations of the nature and extent of the Gift\nof Men as articulated by Tolkien. A spiritual/theological view of the\nGift of Men The _Gift of Men_ was an act of the Supreme Being Ilúvatar\nthat set the race of Men apart from the Elves. While the race of Elves\nwould know the most bliss and contentment and would conceive more beauty\nthan any others of the Children of Ilúvatar, it was decreed by this gift\nthat Men would be the prime instruments of Ilúvatar within Arda.\nIlúvatar willed that the spirits/hearts of Men are not content within\nArda, and find no rest therein, and therefore seek beyond the world and\nits confines. They are not bound to the Circles of the World, as the\nElves and all other creatures of Arda are bound to the Earth. The\nspirits of Men truly leave the physical world, and do not return. Thus\ntheir fates are completely sundered from that of the Elves, who do not\ndie until the world dies, unless slain by violence or ill chance, or by\nwearying at the last of the passage of centuries. But as the years grow\nlong and Time wears, even the Valar will come to envy the gift of\nIlúvatar to the race of Men, that of liberation from the physical world,\nand the inevitability of loss and sorrows that must come with this\nexistence within Arda. Moreover, it is also a consequence of this true\nspiritual freedom of not being bound to either the ordinance of Fate, or\nthe confines of the World that the spirits of Men do not dwell long in\nArda, and after what seems to be a very short time to the immortal\nElves, men age, grow weary, and die. However, a key aspect of this gift\nof living within Arda for a short time was a virtue instilled into the\nrace of Men to be motivated to create destinies for themselves amidst\nthe powers and chances of the world. Men were able to shape their lives\n_beyond_ the Music of the Ainur, which rules the fates of all other\nthings in Arda. Men may choose to live in tune with the themes of the\nMusic that created Arda, or be indifferent to it, or live in defiance of\nit. Ilúvatar understood that Men would not always use this gift of\nfreedom in harmony with the world, and would stray often. But he knew\nthat in their time, men would continue to order their lives within Arda\nand by their _“operation everything should be, in form and deed,\ncompleted, and the world fulfilled unto the last and the smallest”_\n(_The Silmarillion_). Thus Men would become the implements by which\nIlúvatar's plans for Arda will be realized in the ages to come. The\nGift, as originally bequeathed, was not something that Men feared.\nThough they loved their lives within Arda, they relinquished their\nspirits gracefully, almost gladly, and seemed to pass into a peaceful\nsleep, never to wake again in this life. But their souls go to a place\nunknown to the wisest of Elves or even the Valar. However it is written\nthat when the Second Music of the Ainur is played, after the Dagor\nDagorath, the spirits of Men shall be included in this even greater\ntheme, when all of the players will know and understand their part and\nits relation to the whole, and be tributary to its beauty and glory.\nAvoidance of the Gift of Men The shadow of the first Dark Lord brought\nwith it a perversion of the original intent of the Gift of Ilúvatar, and\nbrought fear out of hope, and tainted the Gift. Men began to fear and\ndespise the gift, and began to view it not as liberation, but as\ndamnation. It brought about in the race of Men a kind of self-loathing\nand a denial of the basic nature of their being as the children of the\nAll-Father Eru Ilúvatar. Instead they viewed themselves as flawed in\nsome way and sought to resist this very intrinsic nature of their\ncreation. The result of such actions brought about much anguish on the\nrace of Men through the centuries of the history of Arda. At least four\ncharacters in _The Lord of the Rings_ are examples of the dangers of\neither deliberately or unintentionally trying to avoid the Gift of Men.\nThree of them are transformed into “monsters” by being denied the Gift\nof Men by sins that they have committed: the Lord of the Nazgûl (and all\nof the Nazgûl), the King of the Dead, and Sméagol. (Since Sméagol is a\nHobbit-like creature, he is numbered among the Younger Children of\nIlúvatar, and as such is entitled to the strange Gift of Men.) The\nNazgûl are made immortal, but also doomed, by the Nine Rings. The King\nof the Dead is transformed into a ghost or monster by the curse of\nIsildur, because he and his subjects break an oath to fight against\nSauron. Long after his natural death, he fulfils his oath, and is\nreleased from his condition by Aragorn. (This presumably also applies to\nthe other Dead.) Sméagol is consumed by the Ring; over the years, its\ninfluence transforms him from a Hobbit into the freakish Gollum. Bilbo\nBaggins, like Sméagol, is a Hobbit rather than a Man, but Hobbits are\nalso among the Younger Children of Ilúvatar, and are therefore\nrecipients of the Gift of Men. Bilbo encounters Gollum in his cave and\nescapes with the Ring. Being a Hobbit of much better character than\nSméagol, Bilbo better resists the negative effects of possessing the One\nRing. He does not appear to age considerably, but has a sense of\nbecoming “thin and stretched.” Toward the end of his possession of the\nRing, Bilbo begins to show some of the obsessive tendencies of Gollum —\ncalling the Ring “my precious,” and showing flashes of dark hostility\nwhen asked by Gandalf to give the Ring to his heir, Frodo. After the\nRings destruction, Bilbo's appearance begins to show signs of age and\nweariness. Those Men with the greatest understanding treated death as\nthe Gift it was originally intended to be, and when their time came\ngladly gave themselves up to it. We see this, for example, in the\nearlier Kings of Númenor, and Aragorn also accepted the Gift at the\nnatural end of his life. For most Men, though, the Gift was tainted by\nMorgoth, and they came to fear it rather than embrace it. This fear\nreached its peak in the later years of Númenor, where even the long life\ngiven to the Númenóreans was not enough, and wise men did all they could\nto try to escape death altogether. In the end, this desperation led to\nNúmenor's destruction when Ar-Pharazôn led a battle fleet to the Undying\nLands, having been convinced by Sauron's lies that they held the key to\nthe immortality of the Elves. This deception and treachery eventually\nsaw the lifespans of Men return to more normal times. Even after\nmillennia, the descendants of Numenor still possessed some extended\nlifespans beyond typical Men; these men became known as the Dúnedain.\nde:Gabe der Menschen it:Fato degli Uomini"

The sceptre of the Kings was lost with\nAr-Pharazôn in the destruction of Númenor in 3319 of the Second Age. But\nElendil, the last Lord of Andúnië, took his sceptre with him when he\nescaped from Númenor and came to Middle-earth and founded the Kingdoms\nof Gondor and Arnor. While the Kings of Gondor wore a crown, the Kings\nof Arnor bore the sceptre. It became known as the Sceptre of Annúminas,\nthe original capital of the North-kingdom. After the North-kingdom was\ndivided in 861 the sceptre passed to the Kings of Arthedain, and then,\nafter Arthedain ceased to exist in 1974, to the Chieftains of the\nDúnedain. Since the Dúnedain were a wandering people, the sceptre and\nother heirlooms were kept at Rivendell, home of Elrond. By the end of\nthe Third Age, the Sceptre of Annúminas was over 5,000 years old and was\nthe oldest artifact of Men in Middle-earth, barring the Ring of Barahir\nwhich was gifted to Barahir by the Elven king Finrod Felagund in the\nFirst Age as a symbol of the eternal friendship between men and elves.\nOn Midsummer's Eve of 3019, Elrond brought the Sceptre of Annúminas to\nMinas Tirith and gave it to Aragorn, King Elessar, of the Reunited\nKingdom of Gondor and Arnor. Etymology The _SCEPTRE OF ANNÚMINAS_ was so\nnamed because the Kings of Arnor initially ruled from the city of\nAnnúminas. The name Annúminas means “tower of the west.” A sceptre, or\nscepter, is a staff held by a king as an emblem of authority."

    "page_id": "8048",
    "text": "Description A phalanx was a formation of soldiers that formed multiple\nranks of warriors supporting each other with spears, pikes, and/or\nhalberds. The phalanx is an extremely formidable formation on the\noffensive and defensive. This fighting formation led the Greeks to many\nvictories. A phalanx is a tightly-packed group of soldiers (depending on\nthe terrain and formation, usually 250-500+ soldiers per phalanx) that\nis armed with polearms. The first few rows protrude their spears on a\nhorizontal level, while the second, third, and so forth rows point their\npolearms in upward intervals until the very last rows have their weapons\npointed completely upward. They are not to be confused with the similar\n''tercios, ''a 16th-century Spanish fighting formation. The phalanx did\nhave its uses. Cavalry did not dare stride anywhere close to the\nbristling hedgehog of steel weapon-heads, knowing full well that they\nand their horses would be impaled on the advancing pikes. Thus, it was a\ncheap and effective anti-cavalry formation that could enable a\nbreakthrough by infantrymen that would otherwise be run down like wheat\nin the field by horsemen. The only known cavalry in Middle-earth that\ncould possibly negate or minimize the effect of the phalanx were the\nKataphrakts of Rhûn, who were thickly-clad in sumptuous and supremely\nexpensive plate armor. Interestingly enough, the phalanx could also be\nused to negate or completely nullify the effect or enemy arrowheads. The\nvast forest of spears facing upward can cause arrows to break, deflect\nfrom their targets, or fracture. This would prove a severe disadvantage\nto civilizations which heavily depended on ranged weaponry (i.e. the\nGaladhrim, Thranduil's woodland Elves). Types of Phalanxes Defensive\nThis is the most basic form of a phalanx, quite commonly a defensive\nphalanx would consist of, the first rank would kneel with their spears\nor pikes held out at about the height of their shoulders, the next rank\nwould also kneel and hold their spears slightly higher, followed by the\nnext row standing with their spears angled slightly above the row before\nthem. On occasion the phalanx would consist of a few additional rows but\nthey commonly consisted of only three rows of troops. In the great\nbattles of Middle-earth, almost every army of every faction utilized the\nphalanx, due to its supreme lethality and effectiveness against cavalry\nand infantry alike. The First Age The War of the Great Jewels During the\nNirnaeth Arnoediad (Battle of Unnumbered Tears) of the First Age, the\n10,000-strong army of Pikemen sent out by Turgon, the King of Gondolin,\nwould have most certainly utilized this formation in open battle.\nAlthough we have no specific mention of it in Tolkien's legendarium,\nthis formation is probably the only thing that stood between the fleeing\nforces of the Eldarand the Edain and certain destruction at the hands of\nOrcs and Balrogs. The hitherto-invincible camouflaged cavalry of Morgoth\nwere stayed and broken upon the pikes of Gondolin, while Orcs died by\nthe boatload upon the cold steel of the Elves. Their delaying action\nkept the flame of resistance going against Morgoth, and the valor of the\nElves of Gondolin led to his eventual downfall. The Second Age The army\nof the Númenóreans also used these formations, as evidenced in the\nBattle of Dagorlad, during the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. It was\nsupremely effective at halting significant Orcish advances and the\nindomitable reach of the infantrymen in the phalanx gave the archers\nample protection to continue the round-the-clock slaughter of Sauron's\narmy. The Third Age and Beyond During the Battle of the Pelennor Fields,\nthe army of Orcs vainly utilized a crude and sloppy phalanx formation of\neven cruder polearms to stop the deluge of Rohirrim. It failed\nmiserably, stating that even the best tactics will be futile while used\nby a lacking army. Offensive This form of phalanx is far more aggressive\nform of a phalanx in which all the troops participating in the phalanx\nremain standing at all times and march towards the enemy lines. This\nform of attack usually consists of only two rows of troops as this makes\nthe formation just that much more maneuverable, and allows for a quick\ntransit from offensive to defensive formation. Variations The most\ncommon variation of a standard phalanx was known as a “shield-wall\nphalanx”, (employed by the Easterlings) in which all ranks of soldiers\nwould be equipped with shields and would form a wall of shields that\nwould extend across the entire front row and along both of the sides of\nthe formation to protect all troops contained within the phalanx, it\nalso allowed for the troops on the inside to shift themselves to support\nany side that was pressed by enemies and to easily fill any gaps that\nwere caused by casualties as the battles wore on. This variation also\nallowed for the rear rows to about face and to protect the rear of the\ncolumn far more effectively than a standard phalanx. Another clever pike\nformation invented by the Easterlings (but was used by all spearmen of\nMiddle-earth) was the porcupine formation, it combined the sheer\nimpenetrability of a phalanx with the highly effective Shiltron that\nprotected the flanks. (Featured in battle for middle earth game) It was\nmainly used as a last stand formation or as an anti-outflanking\nformation that could defend those in formation from all angles of\nattack. The way it was used was that the officer would shout\n“porcupine!” and the spearmen would put their polearms forward and form\na circle, hence the name porcupine. Another common variation of a\nphalanx was employed by the Guard of the Fountain Court crudely referred\nto as a “mini phalanx” in which the soldiers would form the phalanx in\nthe same way as stated above, but it would only consist of two rows of\ntroops and they would only be positioned to defend forwards instead of\ndefending their flanks."

    "text": "The DRAGON-HELM OF DOR-LÓMIN, also known as the DRAGON OF DOR-LÓMIN,\nDRAGON-HEAD OF THE NORTH, and the HELM OF HADOR, was a formidable\nDwarven war helmet from the First Age. It was most notably associated\nwith Túrin. Description The appearance of the helm was magnificent,\nadorned by Gold, on the background of Grey steel. At the top of the\nhelm, the armor bore the sculpture of the Dragon, Glaurung, The\nDeceiver. The helm also had a visor, “in the style of most dwarven\narmor.” The armor struck fear into the hearts of the enemies of the\nwearer. History The Dragon Helm is the ancient Dwarven-crafted war helm\ncrafted by the Dwarf-smith Telchar of Nogrod for the lord of Belegost,\nAzaghâl. Azaghâl then gave it to Maedhros as a gift, who eventually\npassed it on to Fingon. From then on, it remained in the keeping of the\nHigh Kings of the Ñoldor that then passed it on to the Men who settled\nin Dor-lómin. The helm was given to Túrin Turambar by his foster father,\nThingol sometime between FA 463 and FA 473, and from Túrin's mother,\nMorwen, he had received it. Since the helm was an heirloom in the House\nof Hador, it is sometimes referred to as the Helm of Hador. However,\nHúrin was not of the stature as the rest of his elders. He could not\nwear the Helm comfortably because he was of lesser stature than his\nforefathers. He also said he preferred to look at the enemy with his own\neyes. Túrin, however, was of greater stature than his father was and was\nable to unlock the magical properties of the ancient helm. It had the\nability to protect the wearer from any harm or wound, major or minor:\n_“A power was in it that guarded any who wore it from wound or death,\nfor the sword that hewed it was broken, and the dart that smote it\nsprang aside.”_"

This resulted in an alliance which protected an area\nthat occupied a land between the river Teiglin and Talath Dirnen. It was\nduring this time that Túrin went by the name _Gorthol_.

Battles of Lórien were a series of encounters\nbetween the Uruks (Orc-folk) of Dol Guldur and Mordor against the\nGaladhrim of Lothlórien under the Lord Celeborn and Lady Galadriel,\nwhich took place March 11, 15, and 22 of 3019. The battles resulted in\nvictory for the Elves and allowed Celeborn to lead an assault on Dol\nGuldur, where Galadriel ended the evil influence of Sauron. The Battles\nIt is unknown how the Orc army crossed the River Anduin, though the\nNorth Undeep seems the most likely place to ford. Forces from Dol\nGuldur, reinforced with Orcs from Mordor assaulted Lothlórien three\ntimes, assisted at least once in a joint attack from the west by the\nOrcs of Moria. Though the battles are not described in detail by\nTolkien, the fair woods of the borders of Lothlórien suffered grievous\nharm by fire, though the valour of the Elves prevented the enemy from\npenetrating too deeply into their forest realm. Thrice the enemy\nattacked, and the three times the assaults were driven back. The valour\nof the Elven people that lived in Lórien was great, but Tolkien states\nthat the main reason why Lórien was not conquered was “the power that\ndwelt there was far too great for any to overcome, save if Sauron had\ncome there himself”. Such power was the Lady Galadriel, wearing Nenya,\nwho was able to defeat the Orcs; who then fled south towards into\nFangorn Forest. Treebeard and a host of Ents, having already laid ruin\nto Isengard some days before set out to prevent them entering Rohan. The\ndespairing Orcs fled eastward but were either killed by the\ntree-shepherds, drowned in the River Anduin or fled to Dol Guldur.\nAftermath Following the battle, Celeborn and Galadriel led the Galadhrim\nacross the Anduin in a fleet of many small elf boats. They entered\nMirkwood and attacked Dol Guldur. Then, Galadriel came forth and threw\ndown the walls and cleansed its pits with her power, and ended the grasp\nof evil in the forest. Dol Guldur was no more. As news of the victory of\nKing Elessar down south reached the Wood-elves, Thranduil (who had\nrecently defeated an army in the Battle of Mirkwood) met with Celeborn\non April 6. Mirkwood was divided between Thranduil (who claimed the\nNorth), the Beornings (who settled in the middle, the 'Narrows') and\nCeleborn who added the southern half to his realm, renaming it 'East\nLórien'. Despite these victories, the Elves began to dwindle and\nCeleborn himself departed over the Sea during the early Fourth Age.",

    "text": "This is an overview of the COSMOLOGY of J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth\nlegendarium. Each entry is followed by any alternate names, any roughly\ncorresponding primary world name in parentheses, and a brief\ndescription. A question mark after the primary world name indicates that\nthe identification may be partially speculative or disputed. - TIMELESS\nHALLS, (Heaven) - The home of Eru (God) outside of Time. They are\nsimilar to Heaven in that they exist outside the boundaries of the\nuniverse and in that they do not have a physical form. It is unknown\nwhether they are the final destination of the souls of Men. This is a\ndistinct possibility, however. In fact, it is confirmed in the tale of\nAdanel that Men return to Eru, but it is questionable that this tale can\nbe considered canon, although Christopher Tolkien once considered\nputting it in the appendices of the Silmarillion. - THE VOID, Avakúma,\nKúma, the Outer Dark, the Eldest Dark, the Everlasting Dark - An\nabstract, uninhabited region of nothingness described as existing\noutside the Timeless Halls, Arda, and all of Eä. It is possible that the\nVoid outside of Eä and the one surrounding Arda were different, but this\nis not clearly defined. No being in the Void can use any power they\npossess within the Void. Melkor was cast into THE VOID after the War of\nWrath, but legend predicts his return to the world before the end, in\nDagor Dagorath. - EÄ, (the Universe) - EÄ is the Quenya name for the\nuniverse, as a realization of the vision of the Ainur. The word comes\nfrom the Quenya word for _to be_. Thus, Eä is _the World that Is_, as\ndistinguished from _the World that Is Not_. It may thus be assumed that\neverything outside Eä, including the Timeless Halls of Ilúvatar, has no\nmaterial form. The Ainur, angelic beings from the Timeless Halls beyond\nEä, refer to it as “the Little Kingdom”. This refers to the fact that\nwithin the mind of Eru Ilúvatar (God), all creation that humans can see\nis really just a tiny thing in comparison. _Eä_ was the word spoken by\nEru Ilúvatar by which he brought the universe into actuality. - ARDA,\nIlu - See Arda. The world, including everything in the skies around it.\n- VAIYA, Ekkaia, the Enfolding Ocean, the Encircling Sea, (Outer space)\n- A dark sea that surrounds the world before the cataclysm at the end of\nthe Second Age. Vaiya flows completely around the world, forming a sea\nbelow it and a form of air above it. Arda is described as floating on\nVaiya, like a ship on a sea. Ulmo, the Lord of Waters, dwells in Vaiya,\nbelow the roots of Arda. Vaiya is described as extremely cold. Where its\nwaters meet the waters of Belegaer in the northwest of Middle-earth, a\nchasm of ice is formed, the Helcaraxë. Vaiya cannot support any ships\nexcept the boats of Ulmo; the ships of the Númenóreans that tried to\nsail on it sank, drowning the sailors. After Arda was made round, Vaiya\napparently disappeared, although it may have been changed into the upper\natmosphere of the world. - ILMEN, (the Solar system) - A region of clean\nair pervaded by light before the cataclysm at the end of the Second Age.\nThe stars and other celestial bodies are found in this region. Tolkien\nlikely derived its name from _ilma_, the Finnish word for air. The Moon\npasses through Ilmen on its way around the world, plunging down the\nChasm of Ilmen on its way back. - ALCARINQUE, Morwen, Silindo,\n(Jupiter?) - ANARRIMA - ANOR, Ur, (the Sun) See Sun. - BORGIL,\n(Aldebaran?) - CARNIL, (Mars?) - EARENDIL’S STAR, Gil-Amdir, Gil-Estel,\nGil-Oresetel, Gil-Orrain, (Venus) - EKSIQILTA, Ekta-, (Orion’s Belt) -\nELEMMÍRË, (Mercury?) - HELLUIN, Gil, Nielluin, Nierninwa, (Sirius) -\nITHIL, Silmo, (the Moon) See Moon. - LUINIL, (Uranus?) - LUMBAR,\n(Saturn?) - MENELVAGOR, Daimord, Menelmacar, Mordo, Swordsman of the\nSky, Taimavar, Taimondo, Telimbektar, Telimektar, Telumehtar, (Orion) -\nA constellation meant to represent Túrin Turambar and his eventual\nreturn to defeat Melkor in The Last Battle. Menelmacar superseded the\nolder form, Telumehtar (which nonetheless continued in use), and was\nitself adopted into Sindarin as Menelvagor. - MORWINYON, (Arcturus) -\nNENAR, (Neptune?) - REMMIRATH, Itselokte, Sithaloth, (Pleiades) -\nSORONUME - TELUMENDIL - TIL - VALACIRCA, Burning Briar, Durin’s Crown,\nEdegil, Otselen, the Plough, Sickle of the Valar, Seven Stars, Seven\nButterflies, Silver Sickle, Timbridhil, (Ursa Major / Big Dipper) - An\nimportant constellation of seven stars set in the sky by Varda as an\nenduring warning to Melkor and his servants, and which precipitated the\nAwakening of the Elves. It also formed the symbol of Durin, seen on the\ndoors of Moria, and inspired a song of defiance from Beren. According to\nthe _Silmarillion_, it was set in the Northern Sky as a sign of doom for\nMelkor and a sign of hope for the Elves. The Valacirca is one of the few\nconstellations named in the book, another significant one being\nMenelvagor. - WILWARIN, (Cassiopeia?) - VISTA, Air, (the Atmosphere) -\nVista is the breathable air. - FANYAMAR, Cloudhome - The upper air where\nclouds form. - AIWENÓRË, Bird-land - The lower air where the paths of\nbirds are found. - AMBAR, Imbar, (Earth) - The actual solid land mass of\nthe world. Middle-earth is one continent of Ambar. - ËAR, (Oceans) - The\nseas of the world."

    "page_id": "8514",
    "text": "The BREAKING OF THE FELLOWSHIP was the event during the first book which\nthe Fellowship of the Ring splits up and all go their separate ways.\nFrodo and Sam go to Mordor, Boromir is killed, Merry and Pippin are\nkidnapped by the Uruk-hai and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli pursue them\ninto Rohan. Dated at February 26, 3019, it occured at the end of _The\nFellowship of the Ring_ and at the very beginning of _The Two Towers_.\nHistory Ten days after leaving Lothlórien, the fellowship are rowing\ndown the Anduin in the boats given to them by Galadriel. They stop at\nAmon Hen where they have to decide which way to go next (straight\ntowards Mordor on the Eastern side of the river, or to Minas Tirith on\nthe Western side to gain Gondor's aid). Opinion is divided on this as\nBoromir wants to pass through Gondor, the land of his people, which he\nthinks will be the safer option. Also, not understanding the power of\nthe Ring, he thinks that Gondor would be able to use it and so have the\npower to overthrow Sauron. However, Aragorn is reluctant to lead the\nring anywhere near Minas Tirith, as he does not trust Denethor and his\nmen. While they are resting, Frodo walks off alone to sit beside the\nriver and the Falls of Rauros. He is soon joined by Boromir, who talks\nto Frodo, giving him advice, although Frodo has already been warned by\nGaladriel that his friends will turn against him. Boromir's words become\nmore and more aggressive, saying that the Ring should not be destroyed,\nbut used against Sauron, and he asks Frodo to lend him the Ring. When\nFrodo refuses, he becomes angry and tries to take it by force, causing\nFrodo to put on the Ring, disappear and run away. After a minute he\nrealizes what he has done and weeps, begging Frodo to come back, but\nFrodo is already far away. Frodo then realizes the effect that the Ring\nis having on his companions, and that slowly it will destroy them all.\nHe decides to continue the Quest on his own and from there journeys to\nMordor alone, so that his friends will not have to suffer on his behalf.\nAs he is about to leave in the boat, Sam comes running out and insists\non going with Frodo. When Frodo tells him to go back, Sam wades out into\nthe water towards the boat even though he cannot swim, and begins to\ndrown, prompting Frodo to rescue him. Although originally annoyed, Frodo\nrealizes that Sam will be useful for the journey ahead, and that he\nneeds a good friend to help him along. The Fellowship of the Ring ends\nwith Frodo and Sam beginning their journey together towards Mordor. The\nTwo Towers opens with the rest of the fellowship searching for Frodo,\nuntil they hear Boromir's horn, signalling that he was in need, along\nwith Orc voices. Aragorn arrives to find Boromir lying by a tree\nsurrounded by dead Orcs, and pierced with many arrows. With Boromir's\nlast words he tells Aragorn not to let Minas Tirith fall. He also tells\nhim that the Orcs (later known to be Uruk-hai) have taken the Hobbits.\nReturning to the boats and finding one gone, along with Frodo and Sam's\npacks, Aragorn concludes that Frodo and Sam have gone on alone to\nMordor. The Three Hunters (Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli) then have to\ndecide whether to follow Frodo and Sam or to go after the Uruk-hai to\nrescue Merry and Pippin. Aragorn eventually decides that the fate of the\nRingbearer was no longer in his hands, and refusing to abandon Merry and\nPippin to torment and death, decides to go after them. Portrayal in\nAdaptions Films In Ralph Bakshi's version, Boromir confronts Frodo in\nhis thinking place and Frodo talks of his fears. Boromir offers his\nadvice to Frodo and Frodo already knows of what he wants him to do and\nthat was to take the Ring to Gondor to defend Minas Tirith. Boromir\nbecomes irritated with the decision to destroy the Ring and Frodo tries\nto tell him that all that touches the Ring turns to evil, but Boromir\ndoesn't listen and asks Frodo to lend him the Ring. Frodo refuses and\nBoromir tries to seize him and take the Ring by force. He jumps forward\nbut Frodo gets away. Boromir curses him and accuses him of being a\ntraitor. He then comes to his senses and begs Frodo to come back but to\nno avail as Frodo has already gone. Boromir returns to Aragorn and the\nothers and is asked where he has been he confesses what he had done to\nFrodo. Sam becomes concerned and runs away to search for Frodo. Aragorn\ntries to maintain control and asks Legolas and Gimli to stop them. He\ngrabs Boromir and orders him to protect Merry and Pippin. The Orcs band\nappears and try to seize the Halflings. Boromir reappears and fights\nthem killing several by to no avail as he was pierced by many arrows,\nand the hobbits are taken. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli arrive, but they\nare too late. Boromir tells Aragorn that he tried to take the Ring and\nbegs Aragorn to go to Minas Tirith to save his people. Aragorn agrees\nand then Boromir dies. They set Boromir in one of their boats with his\nhelmet and weapons and then talk. Aragorn speaks of the breaking of the\nFellowship and that the fate of the Ring being out of their hands and\nmakes the decision to follow the orcs that took Merry and Pippin."

On his arrival Túrin went by the alias of '' Agarwaen''\nhowever many of the Ñoldor guessed that he took this name because he\nslayed his friend Beleg. Soon after their arrival, Beleg's sword\nAnglachel was forged anew; Túrin renamed the blade _Gurthand, Iron of\nDeath_. Túrin soon found favour of Nargothrond's ruler Lord Orodreth and\nwas admitted to his council; the King grew to rely on his advise more\nand more over time - he became chief counsellor to Orodreth. Túrin\nconvinced the Elves of the realm to build a bridge at the Doors of\nFelagund; something which would later prove to aid the enemy in\nNargothrond's destruction. This chapter also tells of how Túrin was at\nonce betrothed to Finduilas, daughter of Orodreth; a comparison is made\nto the tale of Beren and Lúthien, however Gwindor tells Finduilas that\nTúrin is not like Beren and that she should hearken to his advise for\nher good."

An empty plain, it was bordered to the west\nby the River Narog, and in the east by Sirion. Amon Rûdh lay to the east\nas well, and many miles to the north were the Pools of Ivrin in Eithel\nIvrin. Southeast of the Talath Dirnen lay the Doors of Nargothrond; and\nbeyond rose the Taur-en-Faroth, the Forest of the Hunters above the\nbanks of Narog. Reaching north and east of Nargothrond, chief city of\nthe Kingdom of Finrod Felagund, the plain was a major buffer between\nFelagund's land and the threat of Morgoth in his far northern fortress\nof Angband. The Silmarillion says of the Talath Dirnen: The landscape of\nthe Talath Dirnen was said to be rolling and mostly open. A few patches\nof forest provided cover for Felagund's rangers, including at the feet\nof Amon Ethir, the Hill of Spies. The greatest of Talath Dirnen's\nwatchtowers, it was so named for the rangers that guarded it, whose keen\nelvish sight could descry any approaching enemy. History The Guarded\nPlain is the place of two significant events of the Silmarillion. Beren\nCamlost son of Barahir crosses the Talath Dirnen after departing from\nMenegroth to begin his Quest for a Silmaril. Seeking the aid of\nFelagund, and knowing the skill of the rangers, Beren holds ever aloft\nthe Ring of Barahir and is eventually waylaid and taken by Felagund's\nsoldiers to Nargothrond. Years later, a bridge is built across Narog\nfrom Talath Dirnen to Nargothrond at the order of Túrin Turambar. This\nhelps lead to the sack of Nargothrond at the hands of Glaurung the\nDragon and Morgoth's forces. After the sack, Niënor Níniel encounters\nGlaurung near Amon Ethir and falls under his spell, furthering the curse\nlaid upon the Children of Húrin by Morgoth. It was sunk along with the\nmost of Beleriand at the end of the War of Wrath."

They settled in the Twenty-first\nHall, above the East-gate, and Balin himself ruled his new domain from\nthe old Chamber of Records, also called the Chamber of Mazarbul.

Daeron was a brilliant loremaster and was the\ngreatest musician in Middle-earth. Second to him was Maglor, one of\nFeanor's sons. Biography Daeron was born in Middle-earth at some\nundetermined time. Following the folk of Elwë, he became an important\nelf close to King Thingol, serving as his loremaster and minstrel. He\ndevised the Cirth (familiarly known as Runes), which would later become\nan important writing form. Daeron and Mablung both attended the Mereth\nAderthad to bear greetings from their King. He loved Thingol's daughter,\nLúthien, more than anything, devising music in her honor and often\nplayed it while she danced. However, she did not return his affections.\nTwenty years after the Return of the Ñoldor, he attended the Mereth\nAderthad with his kinsman Mablung bearing gifts and greetings to the\nÑoldor from the King of Doriath. Hundreds of years later when Beren came\nto Doriath, Lúthien and Beren fell in love, though they kept it secret\nfrom Thingol, knowing he would not approve of his daughter promising\nherself to a mortal. However, Daeron's jealousy of their love for each\nother caused him to spy on them both and report what he saw and heard to\nThingol. Later, when Lúthien learned that Sauron had imprisoned Beren,\nshe sought Daeron's counsel but he betrayed her to the king, causing her\nto be imprisoned in Hírilorn. After she had escaped and went away to\nfind Beren and was feared to be lost, Daeron repented his previous deeds\nand left Doriath to search for her in vain. He lost his way somewhere in\nthe far East of Middle-earth, where he dwelt in dark places lamenting\nhis love for Lúthien. His fate or whereabouts afterwards in the world\nare not known. Legacy His invention of the Cirth provided an alphabet of\nrunes that the Dwarves adopted in their writings and spread throughout\nMiddle-earth, passing them down from age to age. These runes would later\nbecome the script used in Moria and were known as Daeron's Runes.\nEtymology His name is derived from the Sindarin word _daer_ (“large,\ngreat”).

It is not known how they lived but\nit is possible they lived in small tribal groups wandering the forest.\nSecond Age After the War of Wrath and the destruction of the Beleriand,\nOropher, a Sindarin prince formerly of Doriath who chose to stay in\nMiddle-earth, came to the forest known as Greenwood the Great. He and\nhis company were well received and well accepted as they had once lived\nwith King Thingol, whom they regarded as distant kin. The Sindarin\ncompany intended to live like the Wood-elves: natural and undisturbed.\nThis notion was appealing to the Wood-elves and Oropher was soon named\ntheir king, adopting their language and way of life. After being named\nKing of the Woodland Realm, Oropher established his capital on Amon Lanc\nin the southern part of the forest. The Woodland realm flourished in\npeace with its boundaries unchanged and way of life undisturbed for over\na millennium. Sometime after SA 1000, Oropher had his capital moved\nfurther north in around the Mountains of Mirkwood. The main reason for\nthis was the growing threat of Sauron in the East. Oropher and his\npeople also felt threatened by the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm and by the\npresence of Celeborn and Galadriel in the forest. Despite these\nproblems, the Elves of the Woodland Realm still continued to roam the\nsouth of the forest westward down the Anduin. Over one hundred years\nafter the Downfall of Númenor, the threat of Sauron once again grew into\na very real threat to Middle-earth. Oropher and the Elves of Lórien\nunder Amdír both agreed that peace could not be resorted until Sauron\nwas completely defeated. A large army was created and a combined force\nof Wood-elves and Galadhrim marched to support the Last Alliance of\nElves and Men. Though they were as determined to defeat Sauron as the\nothers, Oropher and Amdír's army was lightly armed and less experienced\nin major warfare. They also refused to submit to the supreme authority\nof Gil-galad due to past disputes with Ñoldor, and so fought\nindependently. They suffered heavy losses and Oropher and Amdír were\nboth killed. Oropher's son survived the war and took his father's place\nas King of the Woodland Realm. Third Age Despite the heavy losses their\npeople had suffered during the War of the Last Alliance, the Elves of\nthe Woodland Realm survived and continued living peacefully in the\nforest for the next millennium. The peace was broken in TA 1050 when a\nmysterious being known as the Necromancer began living in the abandoned\nhalls of Amon Lanc. Afterwards, the forest became dark and tainted,\ninfested with Orcs, Great Spiders, and other mysterious and savage\nbeings. The elves were then forced to remove themselves to the\nnorthernmost part of the forest. All settlements in the Mountains of\nMirkwood were withdrawn and the capital and realm's people relocated to\na cave settlement under a wooded hill, in the northeastern border of the\nforest. From then on, the Woodland Realm remained confined to the north.\nIt was at this time that the Elves renamed the forest to Mirkwood along\nother with other places they formerly occupied. The Elves of the\nWoodland Realm survived but lived more cautiously considering the\nincreased danger. They traded with the neighboring realms of the Lonely\nMountain and Dale. This however was not to last as the Elves, Rhovanion\nand much of Middle-earth was affected by bad weather culminating in the\nLong Winter of TA 2758 and TA 2759 and the Fell Winter of TA 2911 - TA\n2912, during which extreme cold and large blankets of snow plagued the\nlands. However, the most devastating blow to the Woodland Realm until\nthe War of the Ring came in TA 2770 when the dragon Smaug came down from\nthe North and destroyed both the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain and the\nMannish town of Dale. Afterwards, the elves moved about the forest in\nsecret and were very distrustful of any strangers and their only contact\nwith the outside world was trade and occasional visitation with the\nrefugees of Dale living in Laketown on the Long Lake. It was probably\nduring this time that the Elves made the Forest Path which ran across\nthe northern forest as the only safe passage, as the main road that ran\nthrough was no longer safe. In TA 2941, Thorin and Company came through\nthe Woodland Realm on their way to the Lonely Mountain on The Quest of\nErebor. Thranduil considered them trespassers and had them imprisoned\nsave for Bilbo, who remained invisible with the use of his Magic Ring,\nwho later released them. After the death of Smaug, Thranduil offered\nrelief to the Men of Laketown for Bard’s valiant slaying of the dragon\nand assembled an army to claim part of the treasure, but Thorin refused\nto share it and so both parties prepared for war. Bilbo tried to help\nthe situation by delivering the ancient artifact known as the Arkenstone\nto the Elves and Men. The situation did not improve and with arrival of\na Dwarven army of five-hundred under Dáin II Ironfoot, and it seemed as\nif the Elves and Men would fight the Dwarves, but the timely arrival of\nGandalf with a warning of an army of Goblins and Wargs coming to do\nbattle for the treasure changed everything. The Elves, Men, and Dwarves\nwere forced to join forces and fight a common enemy. The Wood-elves and\ntheir allies, including the late-arriving Eagles, defeated the orcs and\nmany lay dead, but peace finally returned to the region with the Orcs\ndefeated and news of the White Council having driven the Necromancer out\nof Dol Guldur. Peace for the Elves of the Woodland Realm reigned for\ndecades until Dol Guldur once again was inhabited by evil creatures and\nMordor grew in power and influence. The Woodland Realm became involved\ndirectly in the War of the Ring when the creature Gollum was captured by\nAragorn and imprisoned there, but an orc raid allowed him to escape.\nAfterwards, Thranduil sent his son Legolas to Rivendell as a\nrepresentative of the Woodland Realm and to inform the Council of\nGollum’s escape. The Woodland Realm was attacked on March 15, 3019 by\nforces from Dol Guldur, becoming part of the Battles of the North.\nThranduil and the Wood-elves were victorious and the forest was\neventually cleansed of all its enemies and as Galadriel had thrown down\nthe walls Dol Guldur, there was no longer any threat from there and the\nshadow was permanently removed from the forest. On April 6, 3019,\nThranduil met with Celeborn and both agreed to rename the forest Eryn\nLasgalen (Wood of Greenleaves). Soon after the war, the forest was\ndivided with Thranduil left to rule most of the northern part. Fourth\nAge The Woodland Realm people played an important role during the early\nyears when a group of Elves from the Woodland Realm led by Legolas\ntraveled to Gondor and helped rebuild the city of Minas Tirith and\nreplenished and beautified the war-ravaged lands of Ithilien. It is\npresumed that the realm prospered but like the other non-mannish realms\nit most likely became isolated and unto itself. Its fate is unknown but\nas some Elves left Middle-earth during the Fourth Age and the dominion\nof Man was at hand, the Wood-elves of the Woodland Realm may have\neventually become hidden and ultimately invisible to the eyes of Men.",

    "text": "THE FAITHFUL, also known as ELENDILI or ELF-FRIENDS, referred to the\nminority faction of Númenóreans who remained friendly with the Elves and\nrespectful and obedient to the Valar. Their most noted leader was\nElendil, the Lord of Andúnië, who later founded the kingdoms of Arnor\nand Gondor in Middle-earth. History The Faithful emerged as a result of\nthe divisions that occurred by the close of the Second Age. The\nNúmenóreans had become split between the Elendili and the King's Men, a\nfaction centered around the King that sought to assert Númenórean\nauthority and self-determination. With Númenor reaching the apex of its\nmight, the King's Men eventually espoused open defiance of the Valar.\nThis split would eventually precipitate the Fall of Númenor. The\nElendili, however, not only preserved their ancient friendship with the\nElves, they also regarded the burgeoning arrogance of the King's Men as\nblasphemy, but the King's Men became more powerful, and by the end of\nthe Second Age had begun to persecute the Elendili as rebels and\ndissidents. Fearing their growing strength, the King's men secured the\nFaithful's deportation from their strongholds in the western regions,\nnotably around the city Andúnië. The seeds of the Faithful were sown in\nthe days of Tar-Minastir and Tar-Ciryatan; the group arose in the early\ntwenty-third century of the Second Age during the days of Tar-Ancalimon\nwith Andúnië as their chief city where the Elves were received with\nlove. As use of Elven-tongues and respect for the Valar began to wane,\nthe Faithful became the only ones to preserve these traditions unto\nthemselves. In SA 2350 seeing the coming shadow, the Faithful founded\nthe haven of Pelargir on the shores of Middle-earth as opposed to Umbar\nwhich became a haven of the King's Men. As the King's Men's influence\ngrew and the people and their rulers became more and more greedy of\nwealth and power, there arose Ar-Gimilzôr in SA 3102. Being one of the\nKing's Men, he openly persecuted the Faithful, forbidding the teaching\nand speaking of the Elven tongues nor was meeting with Elves permitted\neither. The Faithful were then forced to move from the west havens to\nRómenna where they were carefully watched. In these evil days, many of\nthe Faithful emigrated to the friendly havens in Middle-earth. Some\nrelief came to them in SA 3177, when Elf-friend Tar-Palantir assumed\nkingship and began to turn Númenor back to the ways of the Faithful. He\nrepented the ways of his forefathers, stopped the persecution of the\nFaithful, and tried to amend the corruption of Númenor but his line\nfailed and the King's Men survived. Tar-Palantir's nephew Ar-Pharazôn,\nson of Gimilkhâd forcibly usurped the throne and the Elendili were more\nvigorously oppressed. He defeated Sauron, the Dark Lord and took him\nprisoner to Númenor. It was not long before the King listened to his\nevil words and took him deep into his councils, Sauron playing off his\nfear of death. This time with the help of the Dark Lord Sauron, who had\nestablished an evil cult on the island to corrupt and eventually destroy\nNúmenórean society. It was during these dark times that the Faithful\nendured their most grievous woe for the King. During this time the\nFaithful were hunted, killed and even sacrificed in Sauron's temple to\nthe cult of Melkor. When the King prepared the Great Armament, Amandil,\nthe current leader of the Faithful attempted to sail to Aman to beg for\nforgiveness and mercy from the Valar. Before doing so, he entrusted his\nson with the task of preparing a fleet of ships to depart to\nMiddle-earth to escape the coming darkness. As Ar-Pharazôn led his grand\narmada to Aman to challenge the Ban of the Valar, Elendil and the\nremaining, Elf-friends were warned by the divine powers to leave Númenor\nforever. They were thus spared the downfall of Númenor when, as\npunishment for an attempt to defy the Ban, Eru Ilúvatar sank the island\nkingdom into the sea. When Númenor was destroyed in SA 3319, the fleet\nreached the shores of Middle-earth founding the kingdoms of Arnor and\nGondor in a lineage of nobility leading up to King Elessar. The\nElendili, under the leadership of Elendil and his sons, eventually made\ntheir way to refuge in Middle-Earth where they were welcomed by the\nElves.",

In the book of _The Hobbit_, the\nbodyguard of Bolg wielded steel scimitars in the Battle of Five Armies.\n_In The Lord of the Rings_, the Fellowship found orc-scimitars with\nblackened blades in the Chamber of Mazarbul. Later, a high orc-chieftain\nclothed in black mail with a spear and a scimitar rushed into the\nChamber. He was slain by Andúril when he swept out the scimitar after\nhis spear was broken and hacked by Sam. At the flight of the Fellowship,\nFrodo saw that nearly hundreds of orcs brandished scimitars and spears\nin the firelight in the First Hall near the Bridge of Khazad-dum. The\ngoblin-soldiers of Isengard did use short broad-bladed swords instead of\ncurved scimitars which was unusual for Orcs. Aragorn distinguished four\nof them from the slain, and he knew Orcs from the North normally wielded\nscimitars. The Orcs of Mordor have made straight blades too, and their\nblade are longer than Isengarders. Grishnákh carried a black knife with\na long jagged blade. Shagrat had a long red knife, and he drove this\nknife into Gorbag's throat. Haradrim The Haradrim are the civilization\nmost commonly described as using scimitars, with their cavalry bringing\nscimitars onto the Pelennor. In the books, their scimitars were “like a\nglitter of stars”, but in the movies the only metal they have are gold\nplates worn as trophies. Through a movie standpoint, the Haradrim would\nhave likely made these scimitars by combining a stone, bone, or obsidian\nblade with a wood, stone, or bone handle. These scimitars can typically\nbe 3 foot 6 inch in length, with the blade being blunt for the first 10\ninches to avoid self-laceration (exposing 4 inches of blunt blade and 30\ninches of sharp blade) Etymology Tolkien uses the term “scimitar” to\ndescribe any curved blade existing in Middle-earth. However, there are\nother kinds of curved blades, including forwards-curving ones like the\nKopis and the Falcutta. Some backwards-curving blades do not count as\nscimitars in swordsmanship, but in the case of Middle-earth as Tolkien\ndescribes it, _any_ curved blade is a scimitar. The scimitar in the\npicture is actually a falchion; a scimitar is a backwards-curving blade\non a J-shaped handle with a cross-guard that curved up on the sharp side\nand down on the dull side. The blade curve was asymmetrical to the\nhandle curve."

Nellas was young\nduring the latter-half of the fourth century First Age and it was during\nthat time that Túrin had come to Doriath as a boy. With the blessings of\nMelian, she befriended him and became his teacher and he learned much\nabout the wilderness and nature. She also taught him an older and richer\nform of Sindarin and the many manners of its pronunciation. As he began\nto grow into manhood, he drifted away from her but she still continued\nto watch over him be it in secrecy. Sitting in a tree watching over him,\nshe witnessed the incident between Túrin and Saeros and saw that Saeros\nhad indeed provoked Túrin and was the cause of his own peril. Summoned\nto appear before the King in one of the few times she walked in the\ncity, she told him about what happen in the woods with great difficulty.\nAfter the King pronounced his judgment, she wept over Túrin’s departure\nand sought to find him but presumably she never saw him again. Her fate\nis unknown in the latter days of the First Age. Etymology Although there\nappears to be no clear origin of the name NELLAS, it is likely to have\nbeen Sindarin and may have come from the Sindarin words NELLAD, NELLA or\nNELLADEL, which all mean “the sound of bells” (or “to sound the bells”),\nor perhaps the word NELL, meaning “bell”. The element NEL- may also\nconnect with Elvish words for the number “three”, and the final -LAS\ncould mean “leaf” (as in the name LEGOLAS, Greenleaf), though it is not\napparent why a child should be called by a name meaning something like\n“three leaves”.

Description The Road\nran from Barad-dûr to Mount Doom in Mordor. It began at the great\nwestern gate of Barad-dûr. It spanned a deep abyss by way of a long iron\nbridge and then ran westward for a league (3 miles) across Gorgoroth. On\neither side of the road were smoking chasms. At the foot of Mount Doom,\nSauron's Road climbed a long causeway up the eastern slopes. The road\nthen wound upwards around the mountain, turning first south then west\nthen north and back to the east. The road encircled the base of the\nmountain, which was 3,000 feet high, and then ran partway up the cone,\nwhich rose another 1,500 feet. It ended at the door to the Chambers of\nFire on the east side of Mount Doom facing the Window of the Eye in\nBarad-dûr. Sauron's Road was a broad path paved with ash and broken\nrubble. History It was probably created in the late sixteenth century of\nthe Second Age when Sauron sought to control the other rings by creating\nthe One Ring, using it as an easy way to get to and from the mountain\nduring his labors. Over the long ages it was frequently blocked and\nruined by the ravages of the erupting volcano, but it was always\nrepaired. Frodo and Sam used part of this road to get up the mountain\nduring their quest to destroy the ring when on March 25, 3019 of the\nThird Age, Sam carried Frodo up the northern slopes of Mount Doom until\nhe found Sauron's Road leading to their destination. “'Why, it might\nhave been put there a-purpose!' he said to himself.

The title continued in Middle-earth\nafter the Ñoldor returned in pursuit of Morgoth.

Such was the case with Fëanor, who immediately claimed\nthe title after Finwe's death at the hands of Morgoth. But he could not\ncommand the same respect, for greater love was given to Fingolfin for\nhis wisdom and leadership, and the Ñoldor of Tirion refused to renounce\nhim. After the death of Fëanor, Maedhros was due to succeed by right,\nyet in repentance of his father's acts he waived his claim to Fingolfin.\nThis move was recognised by all, and the Kingship belonged solely to the\nHouse of Fingolfin. Fingon was the elder son who succeeded his father.\nStrangely however, after Fingon's demise he was not succeeded by his son\nGil-galad, but by Turgon his brother.

Uruk-Hai Battering Ram In _The Lord of the Rings\" The Two\nTowers, _The Uruk-Hai used a battering ram during the Battle of Helm's\nDeep to bash away at the keep doors. Their battering ram was a large,\nheavy log carried by several Uruk-Hai soldiers and propelled with\nsufficient momentum to break down doors. The ram had handles installed\nall over it, and was bound with metallic bands to prevent it from\nsplitting. The battering ram was also fitted with metal caps with at\neither end. Both were pointed and tough, and they could aid in breaking\ndown fortress gates as well as maim and eviscerate foot soldiers._'  _'\nTheir battering ram sucessfully broke into the fortress, the Orcs\nforcing the sharp ends of its cap into the body of a soldier, dragging\nhim helplessly until the he was pulled against the wall, killing him\nshortly after. Then the Orcs brought their fearsome battering ram near\nthe keep. They bashed at the gate just as before, but this time the\nhumans were outnumbered. The ram nearly spelled certain doom for the\ninnocent women and children of Hornburg, they screamed and sobbed in\nterror as they heard the ram slowly hammer away at the gate. Even though\nthe Uruk Hai were successful in breaking down the gate, they were\nquickly suppressed and the lives women and children were spared from\nmassacre Battering Ram used in the Siege of Gondor In _The Lord of the\nRings: The Return of the King_, the armies of Mordor used a similar\nbattering ram in the Battle of Minas Tirith. This ram was larger and\nrequired more Orcs to handle it. The end of the log was also sharpened\nto a point and the metal cap enshrouded it. The door was too strong for\nthis ram to penetrate into the city and the orcs that carried it were\nkilled one by one. Their approach failed until the Grond was called\nforth.

It is generally used to refer to the evil of Morgoth and of Sauron\nover the Ages. History of Darkness The rebellion of Melkor tampered with\nand poisoned the original perfect symmetry of Arda and corrupted all the\nworks of the Ainur, but his chief works of Darkness fell upon the souls\nof the Children of Ilúvatar. After his decline and fall, his successor\nSauron continued his works of evil until he too was defeated. Darkness\nand Men Of all the races in Arda, Men were the easiest to corrupt and\ndrive into temptation and thus were most afflicted by the Darkness. Not\nlong after they awoke, Morgoth, probably appearing as a black rider on a\nblack steed convinced them to worship him as their god instead of Eru,\nbut some escaped and repented, becoming the Edain, the ancestors of the\nDúnedain, but most still remained in darkness. Those that did remain and\nnever went West remained loyal to Morgoth became known as Easterlings\nand were ever allied with the dark powers throughout the long ages\neither for hope of conquest or plunder. In the Second Age when the men\nof Númenor fell under the shadow, their faith wavered and their hearts\nturned ever to Darkness. Then Sauron came and was soon the master of the\nKing's council and men fell ever further into the Shadow, convincing\nmany of the faithless to worship Morgoth in the everlasting Darkness\nbeyond. Here the chief hurt was that men grew afraid of death, a fear\nthat lingered on all men. The embassy from Valinor speculated that this\nwas the first sign of the shadow in Numenor. Afterwards, Darkness\ncontinued to compel men to follow its banner serving both themselves and\nSauron even after his defeat in the War of the Ring. It is possible that\nthis is the “shadow” Gandalf is referring to when he commands Durin’s\nBane to “Go back to the shadow!”. Legacy of Darkness Marring its\noriginal design, the advent of Darkness has brought the world its\ngreatest woe but has brought many together who opposed it. As men whose\nsouls are forever corrupted with the seeds of Darkness brought down upon\nthem by Morgoth and Sauron inherit the world after the Fourth Age, they\nmay still have to face it again and again until the end of the world\nwhen all Darkness is prophesized to be defeated."

Men, Dwarves, Hobbits\nand most other races cannot live forever and thus are subject to aging\nand natural death however various members of those races have endured\nlonger extended lifespans beyond normal constraints through various\nmeans. In Tolkien's universe, despite many having a desire for it,\nimmortality is not desirable for those who are of mortal kind. Every\nrace has a set span; to exceed this span proves to be agony for mortals.\nThere are many examples of this throughout his work: the kings of\nNumenor who became witless and agonized by attempting to cling to life\nas long as possible (as opposed to earlier kings who gave up their lives\nwillingly); Gollum's transformation into a twisted and starved thing\nafter having his life extended nearly 5 times longer than it should have\nbeen via the One Ring; Bilbo's comment on his 111th birthday about\nfeeling “thin and stretched”, like “butter being spread on too much\nbread”, this also being an effect of the One Ring. The only time mortals\nhave ever been accorded peace in immortality is when they are accounted\nof the Elves: this choice has been mostly restricted to the Peredhil,\nthe Half-Elven (the one known exception to this being Tuor, who was born\na full-blooded Man but was given the choice to be accounted among the\nEldar). The Army of the Dead was cursed by Isildur with immortality in\nform of an existence as undead skeletons after they abandoned their oath\nin the War of the Last Alliance. Their only chance of dying was to\nfulfill their oath. In the latter half of the Second Age, Sauron's\ncorruption of the Numenorean King Ar-Pharazôn made him believe that if\nhe could invade and conquer the Blessed Land, he could become immortal,\nresulting in the destruction of Numenor and Ar-Pharazôn's imprisonment.\nit:Immortalità"

According to\nTreebeard, Fimbrethil was the most beautiful of the Entwives. However,\nprior to the Third Age, the Entwives abandoned the Ents in order to\nstart a garden east of Fangorn in what became the Brown Lands; following\nthe end of the Second Age, they disappeared.

Description The Entwives are\ndescribed by Treebeard as having “hair parched by the sun to the hue of\nripe corn and their cheeks like red apples. Yet their eyes were still\nthe eyes of our own people,” yet little else is known of their\nappearance. Like the males they looked after the growing things of\nMiddle-earth, but Entwives preferred smaller plant life such as: small\ntrees, grasses, fruit trees, flowers, and vegetables, while males tended\nthe larger trees. History Like all Ents they tended their lands in the\nvast primordial forests of Middle-earth throughout the Elder Days, but\nsometime in the distant past, possibly starting in the Second Age, they\nbecame estranged from their husbands. They moved further East crossing\nthe Great River Anduin and began living in what became the Brown Lands,\ntending lush gardens; However with the rise of Sauron throughout the\nSecond Age these lands were destroyed. After that they disappeared and\neverything about them was the subject of rumor and conjecture, being\nremembered only in the songs of Men and Elves. In the _The Lord of the\nRings_, Sam Gamgee the Hobbit mentions that his father Hamfast Gamgee\nclaimed he saw a walking tree , but that was more likely a Huorn. What\nactually happened to the Entwives was something Tolkien wanted to keep a\nmystery, even to himself, but in one of his letters he said, “I think\nthat in fact the Entwives have disappeared for good, being destroyed\nwith their gardens in the War of the Last Alliance.”"

    "title": "Realms in Exile",
    "page_id": "9887",
    "text": "'REALMS IN EXILE' was the collective name for the kingdoms, Arnor and\nGondor, established by the Dunedain in Middle-earth after they escaped\nthe Downfall of Númenor. For much of the Third Age, they were the\ndominant powers in the north-west of Middle-earth, and had an enduring\npolitical, economic and cultural significance. Initially politically\nunited, they soon became separate kingdoms, but retained much of their\ncommon culture, and later entered into an alliance. Arnor broke apart\ninto petty kingdoms, the last of which fell in TA 1974. Gondor survived\nand, though becoming ever weaker, it remained the most powerful state\namong the so-called “Free Peoples”. After the War of the Ring, Gondor\nand the former territories of Arnor were merged into the Reunited\nKingdom. Characteristics Both Arnor and Gondor were feudal absolute\nmonarchies. Their first High King was Elendil the Tall, the leader of\nthe fugitives who escaped during the Akallabêth and a member of the old\nNúmenórean nobility. He ruled Arnor directly, while Gondor was ruled\njointly by his sons, Isildur and Anárion, who acted as his vassals. As a\nresult of the War of the Last Alliance (see below), the two kingdoms\nwere politically separated; Arnor was ruled by Isildur's descendants,\nand Gondor by those of Anárion. In a departure from Númenórean practice,\nequal primogeniture was abolished in favour of an exclusively male\nsuccession, perhaps because of the role the King had in both realms as\nsupreme army commander and the frequent wars in which the realms were\nembroiled. While Arnor and Gondor are called “the realms of the\nDúnedain”, in fact the Dúnedain made up only a small part of their\npopulation. The bulk of the human population in the north-west of\nMiddle-earth consisted of native Men and descendants of earlier\nNúmenórean colonists, the two groups having intermingled to varying\ndegrees. The Dúnedain who arrived with Elendil and his sons, being of\npure Númenórean blood and culture, were more gifted and powerful than\nthe local inhabitants. Furthermore, the House of Elendil commanded\nparticular respect and loyalty on account of his descent from Elros and\nhis ancestors' leadership of the Faithful in Númenor itself. The\nDúnedain therefore quickly established themselves as a sort of\nhereditary aristocracy, and provided many of the realms' leading\nstatesmen, administrators and military commanders. However, local tribes\nand lordships, many held by families not of Númenórean descent,\npersisted, especially away from the great cities. Unlike the earlier\ncolonists, the Dúnedain came to discourage intermarriage with those they\ntermed “lesser Men,” fearing perhaps that their gifts would be bred out;\nthis policy eventually had disastrous consequences for Gondor. Among\nthemselves, the Dúnedain spoke a dialect of Sindarin, in token of their\nancient friendship with the Elves, and to set themselves apart from the\nhostile “Black Númenóreans” who had established lordships in the more\nsoutherly regions of Middle-earth. But in dealings with their subject\npeoples and the surrounding nations, they used Westron, a descendant of\nthe Adûnaic language of Númenor, closely related to many of the Mannish\ndialects that already prevailed in their territories. In this way,\nWestron (which also became known as the Common Speech) became the\neveryday language of most of the inhabitants of the realms, including\nlater immigrants such as the Shire-folk; and even other nearby\nindependent kingdoms and peoples, who had languages of their own, chose\nWestron for their dealings with foreigners, so that it became the\nlanguage of trade and diplomacy throughout the West. The Westron was\narguably the most enduring cultural legacy of the Realms in Exile.\nHistory Second Age Arnor and Gondor were founded in SA 3320, the year\nafter the Akallabêth. However, Sauron, who hated Elendil and his family\non account of their friendship with the Elves and their opposition to\nhis policies in Númenor, had survived Númenor's downfall, in which he\nplayed a leading part. He returned to Middle-earth, and discovered that\nthe power of the Elves under Gil-galad had increased in his absence, and\nthat the Realms in Exile, whose territory extended even to the borders\nof Mordor, were inclined to side with the Elves in the event of war.\nThus, after a mostly peaceful century in which Elendil ruled in the\nnorth and Isildur and Anárion in the south, Sauron suddenly attacked\nGondor (SA 3429), capturing Minas Ithil and destroying its White Tree.\nIsildur fled to Arnor, while Anárion defended Osgiliath and Minas Anor.\nIn 3430, Gil-galad and Elendil formed the Last Alliance, initially\nconsisting of the Realms in Exile and the Elf-kingdoms of Lindon and\nImladris. The Alliance was soon joined by the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm and\nthe Silvan Elves of Mirkwood and Lórien. The Allies overthrew Sauron's\nforces at the Battle of Dagorlad, and besieged Barad-dûr for seven\nyears; Anárion, along with many others, was killed during the siege. At\nlast, seeing no other way to break the siege, Sauron himself came forth,\nand wrestled with Elendil and Gil-galad on the slopes of Mount Doom;\nthey defeated him, but both perished. Isildur cut Sauron's ring of power\nfrom his hand and took it for his own. Sauron passed away into the\nshadows and the Second Age ended. Third Age With both Elendil and\nAnárion dead, the organisation of the Realms in Exile became murky.\nIsildur became sole King of both Gondor and Arnor, but instead of\nseeking to rule both Kingdoms personally, he instructed his nephew\nMeneldil, the oldest surviving son of Anárion, before making him\nresponsible for ruling Gondor. Isildur, along with his three eldest sons\n(Elendur, Aratan and Ciryon), then journeyed north, Isildur intending to\ntake up the high kingship of his father in Arnor. Some two thousand\nyears later, Arvedui (Isildur's remote descendant in the north) and the\nDúnedain of Gondor disagreed as to whether Isildur relinquished his\nrights in Gondor, or whether he merely made Meneldil responsible for\nruling Gondor under his suzerainty. Whatever Isildur's plans, they were\nput to a sudden end when he and his three eldest sons were killed in the\nDisaster of the Gladden Fields. In that unexpected attack by Orcs, most\nof Isildur's followers were killed; he himself escaped, taking advantage\nof the Ring's power of invisibility, but the Orcs tracked him to the\nAnduin. When he tried to swim across the river, the Ring slipped from\nhis finger, and the Orcs saw him and killed him with arrows. Of his\nentire army and entourage as he journeyed north, only three eventually\nreached Arnor; among these was his esquire, who had kept the shards of\nElendil's famous sword Narsil. That sword then became an heirloom of the\nKingdom of Arnor. The sceptre of Arnor now came to Valandil, the\nyoungest of Isildur's four sons, who had remained in Rivendell during\nthe war, being still a child when the Last Alliance attacked Sauron; but\nnot until TA 10 did he actually assume his responsibilities. By this\ntime, whatever Isildur's original intentions were, Meneldil in Gondor\nwas a thoroughly independent monarch, and Valandil and his successors in\nArnor, badly weakened by Arnor's losses in the war, were in no position\nto exert authority over Gondor, even if they had wished to do so. So it\nwas that, in place of the unified entity of Elendil's day, two\nindependent kingdoms arose. It quickly became apparent that Arnor,\ndespite its notional superiority, was by now the weaker of the two\nrealms. Although its territory encompassed almost all of vast Eriador,\nits population was severely diminished and it never really recovered. In\nTA 861, Arnor was divided into the three petty kingdoms of Arthedain,\nRhudaur and Cardolan, which frequently fought amongst themselves,\nweakening the northern Dúnedain still further. About TA 1300, an evil\npower known as the Witch-king established the kingdom of Angmar in the\nmountainous wastes north of Arthedain and Rhudaur, and proceeded to\nconquer the realms of the northern Dúnedain one by one. In Rhudaur,\npower was seized from the Dúnedain in the 14th century by the native\nHillmen, who allied themselves with Angmar before eventually being\nannexed early in the 15th century. Cardolan was fatally weakened by a\ndefeat at the hands of the combined forces of Angmar and Rhudaur in TA\n1409, and its few surviving Dúnedain, along with most of its other\ninhabitants, were eventually wiped out in the Great Plague of TA 1636.\nArthedain, the most powerful of the northern kingdoms and the only one\nin which the line of Isildur was preserved, survived the longest,\neventually falling to an all-out invasion from Angmar in TA 1974. After\nthe collapse of Arthedain, the surviving Dúnedain became a wandering\npeople, and secretly guarded Eriador's few surviving settled\ncommunities, such as the Shire and Bree, against evil and wild\ncreatures. In the south, Gondor grew and flourished for a thousand\nyears, gaining territory to the north-east (southern Rhovanion), the\nnorth-west (Enedwaith) and the south (Umbar). It seems Gondor never\nsought to expand further northwest than the Greyflood, and no records\nsurvive of conflict between Gondor and unified Arnor, or between Gondor\nand Cardolan. But nor are there any records of alliance or friendly\ncommunication; Gondor seems rather to have been preoccupied with the\npeoples to its east and south, and with the threat of Mordor, which\nGondor guarded with a series of fortresses. Thus Gondor came to control\na vast territory by the time of Hyarmendacil I, but like Arnor it slowly\ndecayed through a combination of internal weaknesses and external\nthreats. Its Dúnedain population slowly shrank, the southern Dúnedain\ntending to marry late and have few children, so that Gondor gradually\nlost its main source of strength compared to the surrounding nations.\nDuring the second millennium of the Third Age, Gondor was hit by three\ngreat calamities. The first was the Kin-strife, a civil war brought\nabout by the marriage of King Valacar to a foreign woman and the\naccession of their son; during the Kin-strife, the Dúnedain aristocracy\nwas decimated, the great _palantír_ of Osgiliath lost, and Umbar was\nwrested from Gondor by the survivors of the rebel faction. The second,\nthe Great Plague that wreaked havoc in Cardolan (see above), had earlier\nkilled great numbers of the people of Gondor. The third calamity, a\ncentury-long war with the Wainriders, cost Gondor its eastern\nterritories and nearly exterminated the royal family. In light of the\nthreats of Angmar and the Wainriders, Gondor and Arthedain made an\nalliance in TA 1940, the first such alliance for many centuries, and\ncemented it by the marriage of Arvedui, heir to the throne of Arthedain,\nand Fíriel, daughter of Ondoher of Gondor. When Ondoher and his two sons\nwere killed in battle with the Wainriders four years later, Arvedui\nclaimed the now vacant throne of Gondor, by virtue of his descent from\nIsildur and secondarily in right of his wife. Had his claim been\naccepted, it seems likely that a Reunited Kingdom would have emerged far\nearlier, and to the advantage of both North and South. But the Council\nof Gondor, perhaps offended by his assertion of the rights of Isildur's\ndescendants in Gondor, and certainly seeing the northern prince as a\nweak candidate, instead offered the crown to Eärnil, the general\nresponsible for victory over the Wainriders and a distant cousin of\nGondor's late King. Despite the obvious snub the Council thus offered to\nthe northern Dúnedain, Eärnil II maintained Gondor's alliance with\nArthedain, going so far as to send an expeditionary force north to help\nArvedui (who had by then succeeded his father) against Angmar; but that\nfleet arrived too late to save Arthedain, instead providing the bulk of\nthe forces that would smash Angmar at Fornost. In that encounter,\nEärnur, Eärnil's son and eventual successor, was personally humiliated\nby the Witch-king. When therefore the Nazgûl had conquered Minas Ithil\n(TA 2002), and Eärnur succeeded his father, the Witch-king, appealing to\nhis pride, challenged him to single combat; he rode to the gates of\nMinas Morgul (as Minas Ithil had been renamed) with a small retinue and\nwas never seen or heard from again. Thus, within two generations of the\nDúnedain, both Arnor and Gondor lost their kings. The northern Dúnedain\nwere too weak to maintain a kingdom, and so their leaders, the\nsuccessors of Isildur, took the humble title, “Chieftain of the\nDúnedain”. In the south, by contrast, Gondor was still a viable state,\nbut the male-line descendants of Anárion were all but extinct. Unlike\nRhudaur and Cardolan in the north, the Dúnedain of Gondor refused to\nlook for a king outside the royal family, so power was exercised in the\nname of the king by 26 successive Ruling Stewards, the first of whom was\nMardil the Steadfast. By the time of the later Stewards, Sauron's forces\nwere constantly encroaching on Gondor's borders, and several more\nterritories were ceded to allies or conquered by enemies: Calenardhon in\nthe 26th century, and Ithilien, Gondor's sole remaining province east of\nthe Anduin, in the 30th. In the War of the Ring, Sauron sought to smash\nGondor, his strongest opponent, but forces from Gondor and other nations\nbeat his armies back in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. During that\nbattle, Aragorn II, the Chieftain of the Dúnedain of the North, and thus\na descendant of both Isildur and Anárion, distinguished himself by\narriving with a strong relief army at the critical moment, and was\nacclaimed by the people of Gondor as King; his only notable opponent\nwithin Gondor's ruling classes, Ruling Steward Denethor II, was driven\nmad and committed suicide on the day of the battle. Thus, after Sauron\nwas defeated by the destruction of his Ring, Aragorn was crowned King of\nGondor and received the sceptre of the Kings of Arnor, becoming the\nfirst King of the Reunited Kingdom."

    "page_id": "9906",
    "text": "THORIN AND COMPANY were a group of thirteen Dwarves, the Wizard Gandalf,\nand the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, led by Thorin Oakenshield in TA 2941.\nTheir main purpose was to regain the lost Dwarven kingdom of the Lonely\nMountain from the Dragon Smaug. Background The formation of the group\ngrew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled\nThorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family inheritance.\nRemembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels\nin The Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he\nknew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also\nbelieved that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and\nstubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also\nconsidered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned\nto leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill in to their\nparty. History Formation of Thorin and Company On the April 26, 2941,\nGandalf and the Dwarves arrived at Bag End. After big tea and supper\nwith Bilbo, they explained themselves and their intentions. Bilbo was at\nfirst reluctant to join the group but Gandalf rushed him out of the\ndoor. Travels and Encounters After traveling for some time and crossing\nthe river Hoarwell, the company were caught and nearly killed and eaten\nby three hungry trolls. Gandalf returned in time to keep the monsters\noccupied until dawn, when the light of the Sun turned them to stone.\nRecovering themselves, the Dwarves found that these Trolls had a cave\nnearby filled with stolen weapons, food, and a small treasure. Amongst\nthe many weapons were Sting (which Bilbo armed himself with, and which\nhe named after a battle with a giant spider), Orcrist (claimed by\nThorin), and Glamdring (taken by Gandalf). Strangely, all were ancient\nElvish blades that had been forged several millennia earlier, in the\nFirst Age, in Gondolin. Reaching Rivendell in June, the company held\ntalks with Elrond and learned about the secret Moon-letters on Thorin’s\nold map of the Lonely Mountain. Elrond also read the runes on Orcrist\nand Glamdring, thus identifying them. After spending a short time there,\nthe group resumed their journey through the Misty Mountains. On their\nway through the High Pass, the company (minus Gandalf) were captured by\ngoblins. Taken before the Great Goblin, they were in mortal danger.\nGandalf suddenly appeared and killed the Great Goblin, creating enough\ndisarray for them to escape. Unfortunately, Bilbo fell down a hole and\nwas left behind during their hasty retreat. Wandering lost and alone in\nthe depths of the mountain, he found the One Ring and met Gollum,\ndescribed in _The Hobbit_ as “a small slimy creature … as dark as\ndarkness, except for two big round pale eyes in his thin face.” After a\nhazardous game of Riddles with the creature, Bilbo fortuitously\ndiscovered the ring he had found could make him invisible. Wearing the\nring, Bilbo escaped Gollum and a group of goblins guarding the eastern\ndoor out of the caverns, and soon reunited with his companions.\nCollecting themselves, the company made their way down the mountainside,\nwhere they were attacked by Wargs and forced to seek refuge in the\ntrees. Goblins soon arrived and tried to kill the company by getting\nthem down on the ground by tampering down the trees. With all hope\nnearly gone, the hapless company were rescued by a group of giant\nEagles. After thanking the Eagles, Thorin and Company made for Beorn's\nhouse where they managed to impress the wary shape-changer. Fully\nstocked and prepared the Company, they left Beorn's home and made for\nMirkwood. When they reached the edge of the perilous wood, Gandalf\nannounced that he had pressing business elsewhere and would not be\ncoming with them through the forest. Grumbling, they went on ahead,\ntaking the Forest Path into the darkness of Mirkwood. After a few days\nthey reached a dark stream which Beorn had warned them not to drink or\nbathe in, for it was enchanted and caused great drowsiness and\nforgetfulness. They were able to cross it, but Bombur fell in. By the\ntime they fished him out he was already asleep and had to be carried by\nthe rest of the company. Eventually they reached a point where they were\npractically out of food and tried to beg from a group of feasting\nWood-elves. Thorin was captured by these Elves, while the remaining\ncompany, with the exception of Bilbo, were snared by Giant Spiders.\nBilbo rescued them with the help of his magic ring, but they were soon\ncaptured by the angry Elves and imprisoned by their king. With the aid\nof the ring, Bilbo eluded the Dwarves' captors. Weeks later, he found a\nway to free them. Hiding in empty wine barrels, the company made their\nway down the river to Lake-town. There they were fed and clothed with\nthe hope that they would defeat Smaug and regain prosperity for the\nregion. They reached the mountain after a few days and tried to locate\nthe Secret door described on the map. They found it with the help of a\nThrush. Thorin decided to have Bilbo enter the mountain and “burgle”\nsomething. This the hobbit did, and even had a conversation with the\nmighty Smaug (while wearing the Ring, so that he could not be seen). But\nthe enraged Dragon soon emerged and attacked Lake-town, leaving Thorin\nand Company free to enter the mountain. Meanwhile the dragon was slain\nby Bard of Lake-town, but the town suffered great loss and destruction.\nThe Dwarves remained inside the mountain until an army of Lake-men, and\nlater Wood-elves, led by the Elven-king, arrived seeking a share of the\ntreasure to compensate them for their losses. Thorin refused, and the\nDwarves were besieged within the mountain. They called for aid from\ntheir kin in the Iron Hills (a range to the east of The Lonely\nMountain). The Battle of Five Armies and the Dissolving of the Company\nJust before they were about to fight the Elves, the company were joined\nby an army of Dwarves from the Iron Hills. Then Gandalf arrived, just in\ntime to inform them that an army of goblins and Wargs were coming to\nattack. The battle began and Thorin and Company went to war. Bilbo\nstayed out of the battle with the aid of the Ring. The enemy had the\nupper hand until the arrival of the eagles and Beorn. The company and\ntheir allies won but Fíli and Kíli had been killed and Thorin was\nmortally wounded. Bilbo bade farewell to Thorin as he lay dying, and\nthen left with Gandalf and a modest share of the treasure. Legacy The\ndeeds of Thorin and Company led to the restoration of the Dwarven\nKingdom of the Lonely Mountain and the Dwarven dynasty in the Lonely\nMountain, the Kingdom of Dale, the rebuilding of Lake-town, and\nrestoration of peace and prosperity in the immediate area for many\nyears. In the long term, the journey of Thorin and Company and the\nsituations it created led to the Council of Elrond and the formation of\nthe Fellowship of the Ring many years later and played a major part in\nthe starting of The War of the Ring. It also depleted the forces of evil\nso that later Sauron would have less to call upon during the War of the\nRing.

Nonetheless, they were able to maintain\nIsildur's line in unbroken descent. However this failed in Gondor, and\nEärnur was lost, without heirs, in TA 2050. Gondor's rule was taken up\nby the Stewards. There were two attempts to reunite the kingdoms. The\nfirst of these occurred when Arvedui of Arthedain claimed the High\nKingship of the Two Kingdoms. His claim was rejected by Steward Pelendur\nand the Council of Gondor, who elected to maintain their independence.\nReunification More than a thousand years later, after the War of the\nRing, Arvedui's direct descendant Aragorn came forward to make the same\nclaim. This time, the people of Gondor accepted a High King, and the Two\nKingdoms were reunited at last. Aragorn II ruled from Minas Tirith,\nwhich became even greater and more beautiful than it was in the first\ndays after its construction, but he travelled throughout his wide lands,\nand rebuilt Annuminas. When he went north he would rule from there. The\nShire was an exception to this, and though it lay within the Reunited\nKingdom, Aragorn made a law that Men should not enter it, a law that he\nobserved himself. After Aragorn's death, his son Eldarion took up the\nHigh Kingship, and the Reunited Kingdom endured for many years under the\nnew King and his descendants."

Thus she turns to\nCelebrimbor and laments to him, “I am grieved in Middle-earth, for\nleaves fall and flowers fade that I have loved so that the land of my\ndwelling is filed with regret that no spring can redress. I would have\ntrees and grass about me that do not die - here in the land that is\nmine.” Celebrimbor, who is in love with her, remakes the jewel and gives\nit to her.

Much of this story was later influenced the details of the\nsimilar _The Notion Club Papers_ (with at least one of the characters\nreferencing the general events of the _The Lost Road_). I began an\nabortive book of time-travel of which the end was to be the presence of\nmy hero in the drowning of Atlantis. This was to be called Númenor, the\nLand in the West. The thread was to be the occurrence time and again in\nhuman families (like Durin among the Dwarves) of a father and son called\nby names that could be interpreted as Bliss-friend and Elf-friend. .....\nIt started with a father-son affinity between Edwin and Elwin of the\npresent, and was supposed to go back into legendary time by way of an\nEädwine and Ælfwine of circa A.D. 918, and Audoin and Alboin of\nLombardic legend, and so to the traditions of the North Sea concerning\nthe coming of corn and culture heroes, ancestors of kingly lines, in\nboats (and their departure in funeral ships). ..... In my tale we were\nto come at last to Amandil and Elendil leaders of the loyal party in\nNúmenor, when it fell under the domination of Sauron. The importance of\nthe story is that it was one of the earliest introductions to the story\nof the fall of Numenor.

They seem to correspond with the Americas, although\nwhether they were indeed two continents (as speculated in the image\nabove) or a single landmass has never been made clear. Some fans have\nspeculated that these “New Lands” were a remade version of the Land of\nthe Sun to the east of Middle-earth, and that this particular landmass\nno longer existed by the Third Age. Certainly no maps of the Third Age\nextend that far eastward or westward, so we do not know. It is known\nthat it will not have been inhabited by any civilised race, since,\nalthough men knew its existence, they never established settlements.\nHistory After Númenor was destroyed by Eru Ilúvatar because of the deeds\nof their King, the world was changed and made into a round sphere. Aman\nwas removed from the circles of the world and the seas bent so that no\nman could ever find the Undying Lands ever again. In place of Aman these\nNew Lands were created in the west. Sometime at the end of the Second\nAge (between the Akallabêth and the War of the Last Alliance), they were\ndiscovered by the great mariners of the Dúnedain living in Middle-earth\nyearning for the west or searching for the Isle of Meneltarma. Coming\nupon them, they found these New Lands to be much like the old ones where\nthings were mortal and not forever. It is not known whether men ever\nreturned to these lands afterwards but in the finding of these lands,\nmen did discover that the world was now round."

It was close to the Great Goblin's cavern by\nfollowing an estimated thirty miles of long, dark, and narrow tunnel.\nThe cave housed a small subterranean lake of ice cold water in which sat\na tiny island which supplied Gollum with a small amount of protection\nfrom the nearby Goblin Camp.

Gollum, afraid of\nBilbo's Elvish dagger, didn't attack as he normally would have done.\nInstead, he spoke to Bilbo and ended up taking part in a game of riddles\nwith the hobbit. If Gollum won, he would kill and eat Bilbo, and if\nBilbo won, Gollum would show him the way out. After Gollum lost the\nriddle-game and discovered the loss of the Ring, he became enraged and\ntried to kill Bilbo. However, Bilbo put on the Ring and used it to\nfollow Gollum to the exit of the cave. After Bilbo's escape with the\nRing, Gollum remained in the cave for a long time.

The Goblin King would occasionally send goblins down to\nget fish, and Gollum would kill the goblin and eat it. The goblins,\nhowever, did not seem to suspect Gollum's existence. It first appears in\n_The Hobbit_ in the chapter Riddles In The Dark, as the meeting place of\nGollum and Bilbo, after the latter discovers the former's lost\n“property:” the One Ring. There, the two engage in a battle of riddles,\nwhich ends when Bilbo asks Gollum what is in his own pocket. Gollum then\ndiscovers his ring is missing and finds that Bilbo has it."

    "text": "A HALBERDIER is a military unit that features both in the Lord of the\nRings trilogy and the real world. They are soldiers armed with a long\npolearm known as a halberd, and are usually utilized in the anti-cavalry\nrole and sometimes phalanx fighting formations. The halberd is far more\neffective and useful than its distant cousin, the pike. It consists of a\nlong wooden pole (about 10+ feet long) with an axe head mounted to one\nside of the weapon and another implement, usually a metal spike, mounted\nto the opposite side. With this lethal combination, a halberdier could\nnot only stab a horse or impale its rider, but also dismount the\ncavalryman, parry and block other polearms, or hamstring the rider's\nmount. Many armies and nations in Middle-earth realized its\neffectiveness and thus trained special units to wield the halberd, known\nas HALBERDIERS. Mordor The armies of Mordor were the greatest exponents\nof this weaponry, and their influence passed it on to other allies\nserving under the thumb of Sauron. However, these weapons were anything\nbut fine smith-craft; they more or less resembled a rusted pruning hook\nhorribly blighted by the corrupting influence of the Dark Lord. The\nbasic halberd design encompassed a bewildering array of variants in\nSauron's army, as seen when the Orcs under Gothmog kneel with their\nweapons in a vain attempt to stem the onrushing deluge of Rohirrim\nhorsemen on the Pelennor Fields in the _Return of the King_movie.\nDespite the near-total annihilation of the Mordor-host by the cavalrymen\nof Rohan, the Orcish halberdiers appear to have taken down a few of\ntheir vaunted mounted enemies. Isengard The Uruk-hai of Saruman also\nappear to utilize the halberd, alongside the more numerous pike. Several\ncan just about be made out during the Battle of the Hornburg, being\nutilized by Saruman's Dunlending allies as well. These, in addition,\nalso resemble more of a rusty pruning hook than a worthy weapon to be\nused in combat. Rhûn and the Harad Serving for many years alongside the\nhalberd-loving armies of Sauron, the soldiers of Rhûn and the Harad\nappear to have adopted the habit as well. In the ''Two Towers ''movie\nand book, the army of Easterlings marching into the Black Gate wield\nclearly visible halberds and other polearms. The Rhûnic halberd retains\nthe ash pole wielded by its Gondorian adversaries, but has other,\ndistinct features as well. For one, each appears to be a finely-crafted\nwork of masterful craftsmanship, not a pruning hook. Instead of a\nsmooth, keen axe head edge, the Easterling halberd possesses a heavily\nserrated edge designed to rend bone and flesh. The standard spear point\ntops the pole, while a steel spike protrudes from the opposite side of\nthe axe head. Aside from the armies of Mordor, the Rhûnic soldiers were\nthe best exponents of this superb weaponry. The Haradrim also utilized\nthese weapons, though not on such a massive scale as their Easterling\nand Orc companions-in-arms. Several of their soldiers, riding upon the\nmumakil at the Pelennor Fields, wield halberd-like polearms. It can thus\nbe assumed that a fair amount of their brethren utilized these weapons\nas well. Gondor and Rohan The Free Peoples of Middle-earth also used\nhalberds, though on a much lesser scale than their adversaries. Several\nsoldiers of Gondor, seen in Minas Tirith, wield halberds instead of\npikes. During the sack of Rohan in the ''Two Towers ''movie, the\nhastily-assembled Rohirrim militias also appear to have used crude\nhalberds in a vain attempt to halt the Uruk-hai advance."

It ran between Minas Tirith and the Fords\nof Isen in the Gap of Rohan, where it joined the North-South Road to\nArnor. The Great West Road was approximately 425 miles long. At its far\neastern end, the Great West Road met the North-way which came from Minas\nTirith through Forannest, the North-gate of the Rammas Echor. The Great\nWest Road then curved around Amon Dîn and ran westward through Anorien.\nThe Road skirted the edge of the Drúadan Forest and passed the\nBeacon-hills of Gondor at the foot of the White Mountains. The Great\nWest Road ran through the edge of the Firien wood to avoid the marshy\nland north of the forest. A path marked by a standing stone branched\nsouthward off the Road to Halifirien, the last of the Beacon-hills. At\nthe western edge of the Firien Wood, the Great West Road crossed a\nbridge over the Mering Stream, which was the border between Gondor and\nRohan. In Rohan, the Great West Road passed through the Fenmarch and the\nregions of the Eastfold and the Folde. The Road traversed the Snowbourn\nby way of a ford near Edoras, and a track branched off to the city.\nFurther on, the Deeping-road branched off into the Deeping Coomb where\nHelm's Deep was located. The Great West Road then curved northwestward\nfor a ways. About two miles before the Fords of Isen there was a sharp\nwestward turn and the Road ran straight down to the riverbank. On the\nother side of the Isen, the North-South Road began. A branch road led\nnorth to Isengard. In the early days of Gondor, the Great West Road and\nthe North-South Road formed a single Royal Road between the two Kingdoms\nof the Dunedain. At that time, the region between the Mering Stream and\nthe Fords of Isen was a province of Gondor called Calenardhon. In TA\n2510, that land became Rohan and the Rohirrim were responsible for\nmaintaining the stretch of the Great West Road that ran through their\nland. During the War of the Ring, an army from Mordor crossed the Anduin\ninto Anorien and blocked the Great West Road. They dug trenches and\nerected stakes in the roadway with the purpose of preventing the\nRohirrim from coming to Minas Tirith. But Ghan-buri-Ghan led the\nRohirrim by a forgotten way through the Stonewain Valley and avoided the\nenemy forces. The Rohirrim arrived at dawn on March 15, TA 3019, and\nhelped win the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Names and Etymology Also\nreferred to as the '''West Road '''as well as the HORSE-ROAD and the\nHORSE-MEN'S ROAD. The North-South Road and the Great West Road were\ncollectively called the ROYAL ROAD or the GREAT ROAD. (Note that the\nGreat East Road was also referred to as the Great Road.)

    "title": "Kine of Araw",
    "page_id": "11547",
    "text": "The '''Kine of Araw '''were legendary cattle-like creatures that lived\naround the fertile plains of the Sea of Rhûn from the earliest days of\nArda onward. History According to the Encyclopedia of Arda, the Kine of\nAraw were descended from the even greater kine (cattle) of Orome the\nHunter, who was known to be the master of beasts and birds. As Orome was\nchosen to lead the Elves on the Great Journey, he might have\nintentionally (or accidentally) left his livestock in the East. They\npresumably lived in the areas immediately adjacent to the Sea of Helcar,\nrelocating to their present location around the Sea of Rhun when that\ngreat ocean dried up. Vorondil the Steward of Gondor ventured to the Far\nEast and hunted one such beast, utilizing its great horns to craft the\nexquisite Horn of Gondor. For the lengthy years afterward, it became an\nheirloom of Gondor's stewards, handing it down to their oldest son for\ninnumerable generations. However, its doom drew ever nearer, just as\nSauron’s shadow returned from the depths of the East. During the War of\nthe Ring it was carried by Boromir, son of Denethor. It was only when\nBoromir was assailed by hundreds of Uruk-hai, that the horn was\neventually broken. The Uruk scimitars and broadswords clove the great\nhorn in two, rendering it useless. After being presented to his grieving\n(and insane) father, it was buried with him. Description According to\nAppendix A of the Lord of the Rings, the Kine of Araw were far larger\nand splendid than common, earthly cattle (like Old Bessie). Their hides\nwere a gleaming pallid white that reflected the sun rising from the\nGates of Morning in the East. The horns attached to their gargantuan\nbodies were colossal in size, giving the kine an air of grandeur. While\nnobody knows what the kine really looked like, their size and scant\ndescription that we possess may give them an appearance similar to the\nreal-life Texas Longhorn. There are certain parallels between the Kine\nand the real-world Aurochs. The Aurochs is considered to be the ancestor\nof modern cattle; they were large, dangerous animals with great horns\nliving across North Africa, Europe, and most of Asia. The Aurochs was\ndriven to extinction in the 1600s by heavy hunting, especially by royal\nfamilies across Europe. Etymology '''Kine '''is a rather archaic English\nword, meaning “cattle.” As Tolkien was deeply fluent in Old English,\nWelsh, and Scottish, he would have used the term rather than a more\nmodern one to better suit the medieval feel of the _Lord of the Rings._\nLikewise, '''Araw '''is the Sindarin form of Oromë, which is a term from\nQuenya. The full term denotes and explains the beasts' heritage and\nhistory."

    "text": "COMMON BEVERAGES IN MIDDLE EARTH refers to what people generally prefer\nto drink on a regular basis. Description There are many types of drinks\nin Middle-earth. Some are preferred by Men, some by Hobbits, and still\nmore by Dwarves, Elves, and Orcs. Let us start with Men and Hobbits.\nMen, as well as Hobbits, are big Inn and Pub dwellers, and therefore\nlove a good drink. At the famous Prancing Pony Inn, located in Bree, a\nparticularly loved beverage is Barliman's Best, a very good ale served\nin pints, for Men are used to a beverage normally served in that\nquantity. However, Hobbits find it a rare treat to be served a pint, for\ntheir small body weight accounts for their limited serving size.\nTherefore, some travelling Hobbits that venture into Big Folk territory\nlove to order from any drink selection that comes their way. Other types\nof drinks that Men and Hobbits prefer that are not signature labeled\nlike Barliman's Best would include all types of beer and wine, and\nsometimes mead. Another well known wine comes from the lake city of\nLake-town, located south of Dale near the Lonely Mountain, east of\nMirkwood. This city was full of various merchants, and a prime trade was\nthe selling of Lake-town's fine wine, which was so good that even the\nElves of Mirkwood put forth effort in obtaining it for their feasts and\ncelebrations. This wine was floated back and forth in barrels between\nthe Lake City and the Elven kingdom in Mirkwood by use of a river for\nyears. Dwarves are especially fond of their drink, having been based on\nthe Norse. To them, a day without a drink is a day not fully completed.\nDwarves prefer mead, but will just as soon accept any type of beer, just\nlike Men and Hobbits. Wine is not usually seen as a common Dwarf\nbeverage, for Dwarves are not depicted ever drinking it. However, based\non their common love for any alcoholic drink, one can assume that\nDwarves would not hesitate to drink a few goblets from this grape\nextract. Elves are lovers of wine. As stated, the Elves of Mirkwood get\nall of their wine from the lake city of Lake-town, and there is never a\ndecrease in demand for it. Likewise, all other Elves of Middle-earth are\nnot easily parted from their various types of local wine. Travelers that\ncome upon their feasts will see that after the wine has been passed\naround for a while, a dramatic change in the general merry making\noccurs. When offered other types of alcoholic beverages, such as beer,\nElves are not known to decline, for they seem to accept all forms of\nalcohol. It is even said that an Elf could best a Dwarf in a drinking\ncontest, regardless of the type of drink. Orcs are only known to drink\ndraught (or grog as it's commonly called), but that's not to say that an\norc isn't willing to consume whatever they pillage. It's unknown what\nexactly draught is made of, but based on the typical orc diet it can be\nsuspected to have been brewed from flesh or blood, along with some sort\nof alcohol. Whatever it's made from, it's certainly cause for the\nspectacular explosions that occur whenever draught is ignited. It can\nalso be described as being vile and foul-smelling, but to an orc, anyone\nwho hosts a feast without the drink would be flogged until dead. In\npractical forms, draught is used as a liquid reserve for long trips in\nthe stead of water and as a medicine. The healing potency of draught is\nreflective of the orcs' ancestry with the elves, able to scab over\nwounds within hours."

In the\nbroadest sense, _Telerin_ refers to any tongue of Elves that were of\nLindar origin. From the viewpoint of speakers of Quenya, Telerin was a\nclosely related language still largely intelligible. However, the\nphonology of the two languages differed much, with Telerin often being\nmore conservative than Quenya. Finarfin is said to have learned Telerin.\nHe also gave his sons Telerin-influenced Quenya names. The coexistence\nwith the Teleri, made the Noldor to differientate themselves from the\nspeech of the Vanyar. For example the Vanyar pronounced /f/ very soft,\nalmost like /hw/, but the Noldor resisted this change through influence\nfrom the Teleri. Also, the Teleri prized silver above gold, and their\nskill as silversmiths was esteemed even by the Noldor who seemed to\nprefer the Telerin word _telpe_ “silver” intead the Quenya form\n_tyelpë_."

For Angmar, that most evil of realms in Eriador, was\nlocated just north of the North Downs, and many evil beings who were\nstruggling to find a purpose in Angmar after the departure of the\nWitch-king finally resolved to invade the lands south of them. Thus, the\nNorth Downs became a frontier against this new evil arisen in Angmar, a\nremnant of the old power of the Witch King called the Shadow of Angmar.\nThere was still hope though, in that harsh war zone, for the Free\nPeoples of Eriador waged constant war on the new servants of Angmar and\nthe Witch King.

The Bridge was\nlocated at the foot of Dimrill Stairs over a deep abyss. The bridge was\n50 feet long, narrow with no railing and curved upward over the abyss\nand back down again. It was an ancient defense against any enemy who\nmight get past the Dimrill Gate (the east gate) and capture the First\nHall and the outer passages; walkers on the bridge could only cross it\nsingle file, including any enemies. History On January 15, 3019, the\nFellowship came to the Bridge of Khazad-dûm pursued by Orcs and a Balrog\nof Morgoth. Gandalf stopped on the Bridge, standing in the middle of the\nspan, allowing the others to escape. He leaned on the staff in his left\nhand and held the sword Glamdring, gleaming cold and white, in his\nright. The Balrog stepped onto the Bridge, facing Gandalf, and the\nshadow about it reached out like two vast wings. It raised its whip, and\nthe thongs whined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf\nstood firm and declared that the Balrog could not pass. They fought, and\nthe Balrog's sword was destroyed. Then the Balrog leaped full upon the\nBridge, and Gandalf lifted his staff and smote it upon the bridge. His\nstaff shattered, but the Bridge cracked at the Balrog's feet. The stone\nbeneath the Balrog broke and fell, taking the Balrog with it into the\nabyss, but the thongs of its whip snared Gandalf about his knees, and\nWizard and Balrog plummeted together into the depths of the mountain.\nGandalf cried, “Fly, you fools!” and was gone. It is unknown if the\nBridge was later ever rebuilt or fixed.",

    "text": "MANWË (Quenya; IPA: - “Blessed One”) was the leader of the Ainur, one of\nthe Aratar, King of the Valar, husband of Varda, brother of the Dark\nLord Melkor, and King of Arda. He was also known as SÚLIMO, _'Mânawenûz\nOR Valahiru _'and lives atop Mount Taniquetil in Valinor, the highest\nmountain of the world. The winds and airs are his servants. He was the\ngreatest in authority, but not in power, of all the Valar, Melkor being\nmore powerful. He was however the greatest of the Aratar, among whom\nMelkor was not counted. Biography Manwë was (with Melkor) the eldest of\nthe Ainur, and the one that best understood the will of Eru. When Melkor\ncreated the discord in the Music of the Ainur, the Second Theme of Eru\nthat rose to counter the discord used Manwë as its chief instrument.\nWhen Arda was formed, Manwë was appointed Ruler of Arda, hence his most\ncommon title, the Elder King. Manwë was a kind, compassionate ruler,\nunconcerned with his own power. He oversaw all of the Valar's early\nattempts to order Arda, but was unable to stop Melkor's rampages until\nthe Vala Tulkas came to Arda to assist his brethren. Afterwards, the\nValar under Manwë made an abode on Middle-earth in the Isle of Almaren\nand constructed the two Lamps of the Valar to provide light to the\nworld. But Melkor destroyed the lamps, and the Valar retreated to the\ncontinent of Aman, which they heavily fortified. Eventually, the Elves\nawoke in Middle-earth, and Manwë at last went with the other Valar to\nsubdue Melkor. They succeeded, and Melkor was imprisoned in the Halls of\nMandos. He extended an invitation to the Elves to journey to Aman and\nlive there amongst the Valar. For the three Ages of Melkor's\nimprisonment, the Valar and the Elves lived in peace and happiness. But\neventually Melkor was allowed to plead for pardon before Manwë again. As\nManwë was completely free of evil, he was unable to comprehend it,\nleading him to believe Melkor's lies concerning his reformation. He\nreleased Melkor from Mandos, whereupon Melkor began plotting the\ndownfall of the Elves and the ruin of Aman's bliss. He began to cleverly\nspread lies amongst the Ñoldor, who soon grew to resent the Valar\nbecause of said lies. Eventually, due to the rebellious actions of the\nNoldor prince Fëanor, Melkor's lies were uncovered, but he escaped\nbefore he could be recaptured. Soon thereafter, Melkor recruited the\ngreat spider Ungoliant and poisoned the Two Trees. He then murdered the\nKing of the Noldor, Finwë, stole the Silmarils, and incited Fëanor's\nleaving Aman with most of the Noldor in rebellion. Soon thereafter,\nManwë learned that the rebellious Noldor had attacked and slaughtered\nmany of the Teleri. As such, he forbade the Ñoldor from returning to\nValinor once they left, and stated also that the Elves would receive no\nhelp from the Valar in their war against Morgoth. He then caused Valinor\nto be hidden by way of the Shadowy Seas and the Enchanted Isles to\nprevent the Ñoldor from returning. To hearten the Eldar, he had Aulë\nfashion the Sun and the Moon, for he knew the rising of the Atani was\ncoming soon, and sent Thorondor and the Eagles to watch them. After\nMorgoth's fall, Manwë cast him into the void. Manwë dresses in blue\nrobes and has blue eyes. He wields a scepter of sapphire made for him by\nthe Ñoldor. The Vanyar are his favorite Elves, and they live with him\nand Varda on Mount Taniquetil. Maiar of Manwë - Eönwë, Manwë's\nbanner-bearer and herald. In earlier conceptions of the legendarium,\nEönwë, then called FIONWË ÚRION, was envisioned as the son of Manwë and\nbrother of Erinti, renamed as Ilmarë, Varda's handmaiden. - In some\nversions, FIONWË, later named Eönwë, is the one who will kill Morgoth\nfor his love for Urwendi (Later named Arien). - Olórin (Gandalf), the\nsecond-in-command (and later leader) of the wizards sent to Middle-earth\nto fight against Sauron, and Manwë comforted him when Olórin showed\nuneasiness and fear of Sauron's powers. Etymology The name _MANWË_ means\n“blessed one” or “blessed person”, from the Quenya _man_ (“blessed”) and\n_wë_ (“person”). SÚLIMO literally means “the Breather”, from the Quenya\n_súlimë_ (“wind”) and Sindarin _sûl_ (“wind”). His Sindarin name is ARAN\nEINIOR, the “Elder King”.

    "text": "History and overview BRONZE is an alloy of copper and tin. Bronze can be\ncast, and can be hammered into thin plates also. Used mostly for jewelry\nand ship's fittings (corrosion-resistant), though armor and weapons can\nbe made from the metal. True bronzes are rare today; the Copper/Zinc\nalloy Brass being more commonly produced. Alone, Bronze's two components\nare fairly weak, but when smelted together became a strong, corrosion\nresistant alloy that was useful in nearly every field of metalworking,\nfrom weapons and armor, to tools, to rings and other jewelry. It is most\nlikely that the first discoverer and user of the copper/tin alloy was\nAulë who probably passed the technique down to his creations, the\nDwarves. The great smithies of the stocky mountain dwellers would have\ncertainly forged armor and various bronze tools and weapons, surpassed\nin quality only by the Elves and the Valar themselves. However,\neventually came the dawn of man; And with him came all of his\ninventiveness and ability to adopt the creations around him. Soon, the\nforges and armorers of the Kingdoms of Man also began to adapt and\nchange the Dwarven designs, making suitable creations for humans. Use of\nthe Alloy fell greatly after the fall of Sauron, when many of the great\nhuman kingdoms died out, in many cases the old skills and secrets of the\npast died with their users. In many parts of Middle-Earth, declining\nreserves of copper caused a heavy spike in the cost of obtaining the\nmetal. Also, the discovery and utilization of Iron and Steel as far\neasier and cheaper alternatives were the killing blows to the use of\nBronze at its past greatness. However, use of the alloy never completely\nphased out, many of the land's factions and kingdoms still made use of\nit. Rhûn in the east, for example used Bronze as a primary armor\nmaterial all the way to at least the end of the Third Age. Usage in\nMiddle-Earth Elves The Elves of Gondolin constructed a Gate of Bronze\nwhich was the third of the Seven Gates of Gondolin. Gondor and Rohan In\nthe large kingdom of Gondor, Steel plating and Iron were generally\nfavored over Bronze, though some soldiers were known to wear shirts of\nBronze chainmail. The chest, flank and facial armor of most Gondor\nCavalry was forged bronze. The old, Norse like kingdom of Rohan made\ngood use of the Alloy.

Rohirrum swords and spears and arrowheads were commonly bronze.\nMordor The combination of poor ore deposits, even worse craftmanship,\nand the massive needs of its Orc armies caused bronze to be rare and far\nflung between. The Volcanic mines were the wrong environment for the\nformation of usable copper and tin, the massive forges and foundries\nwere designed with quantity, not quality in mind and were woefully\nincapable of processing and shaping the good metal without completely\nannihilating any trace of its individuality. Though the Orc smiths were\nnot minded enough in their craft to create bronze armor of their own,\nthey had no qualms about looting existing pieces and utilizing it (often\nbadly fitting) and many an orc captain wore a battered helm, a dented\nshield, or a bronze sword, looted from an enemy. Dwarf Clans Rhûnic\nKingdoms Throughout the ages, at least until the end of Third Age,\nRhûnic Kingdoms used bronze as the main metal in their armors and\nweapons.",

    "title": "Elven Weapons and Armour",
    "page_id": "12526",
    "text": "Elven Weapons Throughout their existence, Elves have been masters of\nmaking and using weapons and arms. Their skill at forging weapons and\narmor surpasses the race of Men, but not the skill of the race of\nDwarves. Tolkien writes: “In the tempering of steel alone of all crafts\nthe Dwarves were never outmatched even by the Noldor, and in the making\nof mail their work had no rival.” Even more renowned is the Elven skill\nat using their fine weapons, be it bow or blade. The purpose of this\narticle is to explain the type of weapons the Elves have used and what\neffect these weapons have had in past wars and battles. The article is\nnot extensive, and covers only the most basic of Elven weapons.  Sword\nThe Elven sword is used frequently by standard Elven warriors and it\ncomes in different forms. Apart from notable Elven blades such as\nAnglachel (wielded by Beleg Cúthalion and Turin Turambar, as well as\nbeing forged by Eol, the Dark Elf) , Glamdring (wielded by Gandalf), and\nOrcrist (used by Thorin Oakenshield), many more fierce swords have\nserved their handlers well in battle and have no title. A clue to what\nthe earliest of the Elven blades were made of lies in a description of\nthe first Orcs who attacked the Laegrim Elves in Beleriand. Apparently,\nthese Orcs were equipped with steel weapons which gave them the edge\nover their Elven counterparts. Therefore, Elven weapons at that time\nwere not in existence or were made of a weaker material than steel. When\nthe use of steel weaponry came upon the Elves in Valinor, most notably\nthe Noldor, when Morgoth spoke to them concerning weapons, a great\nchange in the style of weaponmaking came about, likely including the\ncreation of the sword, due especially to superior Noldorin metallurgy.\nSting, the shortsword used by the Hobbits Bilbo and Frodo, is an example\nof Elven blades at their peak. Being able to glow blue when orcs and\ngoblins are near, Sting shows how Elven blades grew to have properties\nunknown to mortals. Even the black sword Anglachel is said to have\nspoken to Turin before it aided him in his suicide. Thus, Elven blades\nbecame renowned as great weapons, capable of performing deeds beyond the\nskill of their handlers and were even more glorious when the use of\nMithril was allowed to the Elves. Bow Elves mastered both the\nconstruction and uses of the bow, developing the standard longbow and\ncreating different variations of it. None were more skilled with the\nlongbow than the Silvan Elves and most notable of those were the\nGaladhrim, the wardens of Lothlórien, the Golden Wood. Some, who became\ntrue masters of this weapon, were renown as skilled marksmen in several\nwars, the most famous being Legolas Greenleaf and Beleg Cúthalion. Elven\narrows are not elaborately recorded and so the reader does not have a\nwide variety of knowledge on the subject, though certain arrows were\ndear to their owners, such as Dailir was to Beleg. Elven Armour and\nShields The armour of the Elves has evolved throughout their days in\nArda, but has always been well made and of the highest quality, the only\nrival to it being Dwarf-made armor which is the finest to ever grace\nMiddle-Earth. Again, not much is said regarding Elven armor only that it\nis bright and beautiful to look upon. Much of Elven armour is derived\nfrom the early Dwarf designs, for the two races have great influence\nupon one another. The earliest Elven armour was made by the Dwarves, and\nappears to have been scale armor, eventually superseded by mail of\nrings. Scale and chainmail were the armors used throughout the First\nAge, and appear to have never been replaced. Thus, the armies of the\nLast Alliance likely wore the same mail worn by their ancestors\nmillennia prior. Gil-galad himself is said to have worn mail made of\nsilver. Lastly, regarding Silvan Elves, the armor in which these forest\ndwellers were clad in consisted mostly of leather and offered minimal\nprotection, Shields were also used by the Elves and highly decorated in\nElf-fashion, like their armour. The shields used by Elves appear to have\nbeen of much higher-quality than the shields of Men--Tuor found himself\na long kite shield, made of wood but plated with steel. Elves of high\nrank used shields decked with crystal."

    "text": "History Throughout their existence, the so-called Naugrim, or Dwarves,\nhave been experts at making and using various weaponry, with no equal.\nThis skill comes from the Vala Aulë the Smith, who crafted the Dwarves\nat the beginning of Arda. The list of common Dwarven weaponry goes on\nand on, and from their very origin each type, including bows, swords,\naxes, and mattocks, have retained a unique Dwarven identity and respect\namong other cultures. Weaponry Axe The Dwarven axe is the most famous\nand likely the most common weapon for any Dwarf soldier. Used\nextensively throughout the wars fought by Dwarves, the axe probably came\ninto use by the time Khazad-dûm was founded, somewhere in the Ages of\nStars. The idea of the use of the axe is to drive forward while\nattacking; therefore, it is not good in defense. Being a weapon that is\nhard to control, the axe takes great skill to master, which shows the\nskill and temperament the Dwarves have in warfare. Sword The Dwarven\nsword is less commonly wielded than the axe. Yet, certain famous Dwarven\nfigures have wielded this weapon to great effect. The warriors of the\nIron Hills carried a broad shortsword as a sidearm. Mattock The war-pick\nwas the favored weapon of the Dwarves of the Iron Hills. Their skill\nwith them appears to have been well-known, for in most instances where\nthey are mentioned, their mattocks are named as well. Bow Though not\ncommonly associated with the Khazad, it appears bows were utilized by\nthem as well. Thorin and company used bows given to them by Beorn in\nMirkwood, and Thorin was the only dwarf of the company to hit the stag\nthey saw, implying skill with a bow. Thorin also scavenged a bow from\nthe armories of Erebor, and used it to shoot at emissaries sent to\nnegotiate with him. Armor Perhaps the Dwarves are best known for their\narmour above all other things battle-related. Dwarf armor would be iron\nor steel chain-mail, which was invented and used by the Dwarves to great\neffect by the time of the Wars of Beleriand. Of course, iron or steel\nhelms and shields would accompany this chain-mail. Dwarven helmets are\nrecorded to have covered the face, with the use of a forged mask. This\nmask was particularly helpful when fighting Dragons, as the face would\nbe shielded from the flames, thanks to the expert craft of the Dwarves.\nLastly, with the use of Mithril, their armor changed more dramatically\nthan any other of their works did. Having such properties as to make\narrows bounce off, Mithril became an invaluable substance to the\nDwarves, so much, so that a single mail shirt could be “worth more than\nthe value of the Shire and everything in it”. However, the use of\nMithril in arms and armor became very limited after Orcs of the Misty\nMountains and the newly awakened Balrog of Morgoth overran the Dwarf\nmines of Khazad-dûm. Dwarven shields are little-known, but the warriors\nof the Iron Hills wore a circular shield on their backs."

It was a place of utmost fear and horror with brightly\nlit fires, horrible-looking pillars that towered like trees boughs like\nserpents, and was filled with weapons and instruments of death and\ntorture. Across the hall stood a monstrous column and beneath it was the\nthrone of Morgoth. History The Nethermost Hall was possibly delved and\nraised when Angband was built or when Morgoth returned there from Aman\nafter stealing the Silmarils. As he rarely left Angband, Morgoth\nprobably spent most of his time here plotting his evils, torturing, and\ninterrogating helpless prisoners. The Nethermost Hall was best known for\nbeing the place where Beren and Lúthien confronted Morgoth when he lost\none of the Silmarils to Beren."

According to _The Atlas of\nMiddle-earth_, the pass was some fifty miles in length from its\nbeginnings in the coastal lands near the Great Sea to Gate of the\nNoldor. It was situated between the mountains that divided the lands of\nHithlum and Dor-lómin, and served as the means of connecting Hithlum to\nthe Firth of Drengist. A stream was here fed by a freshwater waterfall\nthat ran through the tunnel leading to the Gate of the Ñoldor, as well\nas other smaller falls coming down from the sides of the mountain.\nHistory The cleft was no doubt formed by the many upheavals and tumults\nin Middle-earth caused by Melkor's marring of world, and the wars made\nagainst him by the Valar in their efforts to quell his evils. On their\nreturn to Middle-earth, the Ñoldor passed through here and re-entered\nthe Beleriand. When Turgon lived in Nevrast, he built the Gate of the\nÑoldor to facilitate travel through the Cirith Ninniach, but when he and\nhis people removed to Gondolin, the place was forgotten for the most\npart. Later, Tuor passed through here on his journey to Gondolin sitting\nlong there and drinking from the stream. Etymology C_irith Ninniach_ is\nSindarin for 'Rainbow cleft' or 'Rainbow pass'"

    "title": "North-South Road",
    "page_id": "12556",
    "text": "The NORTH-SOUTH ROAD was part of the Royal Road linking Arnor and\nGondor. The North-South Road was approximately 600 miles long. It ran\nbetween Fornost in the north and Isengard in the south. At the Fords of\nIsen, the North-South Road merged with the Great West Road. History The\nnorthern half of the North-South Road was in Eriador. From Fornost, the\nRoad ran south to Bree. Outside the West-gate of Bree, the North-South\nRoad intersected with the Great East Road. At this major crossroads was\nthe inn called The Prancing Pony, where travellers brought news from the\nSouth as well as goods such as Pipe-weed, which first came to Bree and\nthe Shire via the North-South Road. The North-South Road then moved on\nthrough the narrow passage called the Andrath between the Barrow-downs\nand the South Downs. South of the Andrath, a road to the Shire branched\noff the North-South Road. The North-South Road then curved southeastward\nthrough the region of Minhiriath. At the city of Tharbad, the Road\ncrossed the River Greyflood on the southern border of Eriador.\nOriginally, the Road went over the Bridge of Tharbad. On either side of\nthe Bridge, the Road was built up on causeways to traverse the\nsurrounding marshland. However, the Bridge was destroyed by floods in TA\n2912 and all that remained was a dangerous ford. The southern half of\nthe North-South Road passed through Enedwaith, which at one time\nnominally belonged to Gondor but was essentially a borderland between\nGondor and Arnor. East of the Road in Enedwaith was Dunland at the foot\nof the Misty Mountains. At the southern end of the Misty Mountains, the\nNorth-South Road curved eastward through the Gap of Rohan and ended at\nthe Fords of Isen. Just west of the Fords a road branched north to\nIsengard. East of the Fords was the Great West Road to Minas Tirith and\nOsgiliath. Together the North-South Road and the Great West Road formed\nthe Royal Road, or Great Road, which was the main route by land between\nGondor and Arnor. The two Kingdoms were founded in 3320 of the Second\nAge. Each was responsible for maintaining their own stretch of the Road,\nand together they built and maintained the Bridge of Tharbad and its\ncauseways. After the Great Plague of TA 1636, Gondor and Arnor were\nconsiderably weakened and could no longer keep the Road and Bridge in\nrepair. The North-kingdom fell in TA 1974 and Fornost at the northern\nend of the North-South Road was abandoned. The causeways near Tharbad\neventually disintegrated and the marshes encroached on the Road. In the\nspring of TA 2912 after the Fell Winter, floods caused the Bridge to\ncollapse. Fewer and fewer travellers used the North-South Road and it\nbecame overgrown with grass, so that the people of Bree called it the\nGreenway. However, during the War of the Ring at the end of the Third\nAge, unwelcome travellers began to come up the North-South Road from the\nSouth. Some were honest refugees, but many were troublemakers, including\nagents of Saruman. Early in 3019, there was fighting in Bree, and the\nShire was taken over by Saruman's agents. The Hobbits expelled the Men\nfrom the Shire in the Battle of Bywater on November 3, and the Rangers\nof the North returned from the war and dealt with the other\ntroublemakers. The North-kingdom was reestablished by Aragorn, King\nElessar, and the North-South Road was open to travellers once more.\nNames & Etymology The NORTH-SOUTH ROAD was called the GREENWAY in later\nyears by the Bree-folk because it had become disused and overgrown with\ngrass. It was sometimes called the NORTH ROAD and the OLD SOUTH ROAD.\nThe North-South Road and the Great West Road were collectively called\nthe ROYAL ROAD or the GREAT ROAD. (Note that the Great East Road was\nalso referred to as the Great Road.)"

Boldog drove his host south over the highlands of\nDorthonion and the through enchanted forest of Taur-nu-Fuin following\nthe Orcs' Road of Haste into the Pass of Anach. Where fell darkness met\nthe mists of the magic, which were the Girdle of Melian, just east of\nthe river Mindeb, the Orc-host reached the border of Doriath. To meet\nthe deadly threat posed by Boldog's invasion in force, Thingol musters\nhis full might with his two great Captains, Beleg and Mablung. He leads\nthe army of Sindarin Elves beyond the North March of Doriath. Thingol\nand Boldog meet in single combat in the midst of the battle. Thingol\nwielded his Dwarf-forged sword, Aranrúth, Boldog fought with an iron\nspear of some note that was later used by Mablung in the Hunting of the\nWolf. Thingol slays Boldog, the Orc-host is utterly defeated and the\nremnants destroyed by being driven into Taur-nu-Fuin. The Battle of the\nNorthmarch was the culminating battle of a series of attacks in\nMorgoth's campaign against Doriath, following his victories in the Dagor\nBragollach (Battle of Sudden Flame), the fourth of the great Battles of\nBeleriand that broke the Siege of Angband.

History For\nsome millennia, the Hobbits had lived relatively peaceful and\ncomfortable lives in the upper Vales of Anduin and at the feet of the\nMisty Mountains, but by the mid-twelve century of the Third Age things\nstarted to change and life was becoming difficult for them. Men were\nbeginning to increase in the lands near them and with Sauron occupying\nDol Guldur, the long and peaceful forest of Greenwood the Great was\nbecoming evil. Beginning in TA 1050, the migration began but not all at\nonce as only the Harfoot tribe was willing to made the journey over the\nMisty Mountains. The Fallohides and the Stoors joined them in TA 1150.\nThe Hobbit tribes settled in many different places in Eriador. The\nHarfoots went over the mountains making it as far as Weathertop and were\nlater intermingled with the Fallohides settling there in the Weather\nHills for a time.

In the Angle, they were intermingled with both the Fallohides\nand the Harfoots in a series of settlements known as the Forgotten\nVillages. With the threat from Angmar worsening, the Stoors in the north\nmoved south to Dunland with their kin, some even returned to the Vales\nof Anduin, settling in the Gladden Fields, and were probably the\nancestors of Déagol and Sméagol. By TA 1300 mixed groups of Hobbits\nbegan settling in Bree-land, especially in the village of Staddle where\nthey lived peacefully side by side with the Men of Bree. Breeland was\ntheir home for over three-hundred years until TA 1601, when King Argeleb\nII of Arthedain granted them the land between the Far Downs and the\nBrandywine River.

Meanwhile, the elves of Mirkwood had been\nbuilding up an army to go and claim some of the hoard left by Smaug;\nalso the goblins of the Misty Mountains also had built an army to avenge\nthe death of the Great Goblin. The Dwarves of the Iron Hills led by Dain\nalso built an army to save Thorin and regain the Lonely Mountain for the\nDwarves. The Lakemen gathered what troops they had left and joined the\nelves in front of the gate, hoping to get some of the treasure in order\nto rebuild the town. The Dwarves, elves, and armies of men met and were\nabout to do battle when Gandalf arrived and alerted them of the host of\ngoblins. The three races, along with the help of the great eagles,\nunited to combat the massive goblin army. When the battle was over, the\ncoalition had won the day and the Dwarves had regained the Lonely\nMountain, the elves received some of the treasure as well as the men,\nwho rebuilt the town of Dale in front of the gates of Lonely Mountain."

    "text": "The AGES OF THE CHILDREN OF ILÚVATAR chronicle major events in the\nhistory of the Eruhíni. The First Age of the Children of Ilúvatar began\nduring the Years of the Trees when the Elves awoke at Cuiviénen. This\nmarked the start of the years when the Children of Ilúvatar were active\nin Middle-earth. Later in the First Age the second kindred, humans, and\nIlúvatar's adopted children, the Dwarves, also awoke. Tolkien wrote that\nthe later Ages lasted about 3,000 years, though this duration was not\nfixed and he felt that the Ages 'sped up' over time. Each ended\nfollowing the completion of some major event in the history of the\nChildren of Ilúvatar. Other versions of the legendarium In some texts\nTolkien referred to the 'First Age of Middle-earth' or the 'First Age of\nthe World' rather than the 'First Age of the Children of Ilúvatar'.\nThese variations had earlier starting points, extending the First Age\nback to the creation of Arda, but consistently ended with Morgoth's\ndefeat in Beleriand. The terms 'First Age of the Sun' and 'Ages of the\nSun' are commonly used by many fans, but do not appear anywhere in\nTolkien's writings. The 'First Age of the Sun' in this conception is\nheld to begin with the first rising of the Sun and continue until\nMorgoth's defeat nearly 600 years later. While this is at odds with\nTolkien's statements that the First Age was the longest by far it is a\ncommon misapprehension because the subsequent ages all took place\nentirely during the Years of the Sun. The time of Arda is typically\nrendered in Ages. Ages are one epoch of the Valar. Before the arising of\nthe Sun they were approximately one thousand Valian Years in length (the\nexact length of a Valian Year varied in different drafts of Tolkien's\ntexts from close to 10 “Sun”-years in most versions to precisely 144\n“Sun”-years in his final estimation). After the Sun Ages “sped up”, and\nlength is more variable. The Years of the Sun began with the 30th Valian\nAge, and the Fourth Age of Middle-earth began with the 37th Valian Age.\nHowever, only four, not seven Ages are counted. The Second and later\nAges, during the Years of the Sun, correspond more to the earlier\nValarian Eras than to their Ages.

    "title": "Sentinels of the Woodland Realms",
    "page_id": "13461",
    "text": "The Silvan sentinels were the guardians of the woodland realms of the\nElves in Middle-earth. Origin The Silvan archers reached their peak\nafter the fall of Morgoth, at the start of the Second Age of the Sun.\nThis was a period after Beleriand had fallen into ruin and many Elven\nlords, both Ñoldor and Sindar, began to expand into the rest of\nMiddle-earth, setting up fiefs and kingdoms in places such as Eregion,\nLórien and Greenwood the Great. The latter two were at this time\ninhabited by those Avari, or “unwilling” Elves who would not take the\njourney to Valinor. These were the great days, when the Sindar lords\ncame upon the Avari or Silvan Elves and were taken in as kings, great\nlords who knew and taught much knowledge and crafts to the Silvan Elves.\nAt that time the dark forest of Mirkwood was not in existence, but was\nrather known as Greenwood the Great, a huge and lush forest inhabited by\nmany fair creatures, whose beauty and richness was like that of Doriath\nin Beleriand. So similar it was to Doriath like the Sindar immediately\nsettled there and were warmly welcomed by the Silvan Elves. Through\nknowledge of the Sindar craft, the Silvan Elves were able to hone their\nskills with the bow and become master archers, now outfitted with new,\nshining weaponry and gear that only the Eldar could make. But as for\ntheir own woodcraft, none could surpass the Silvan Elves, who were\nalready masters of the forest, able to hide in the shadows and remain\nundetected. Indeed, the “Silvan Shadow” was a trait not even the Sindar\ncould master. Thus the true Sentinel of the Forest was born. Gear The\nweapons of the sentinel are few, easy to carry but extremely deadly. A\nstandard warden would have a longbow, usually made of mallorn wood, an\nElven dagger, knife or handaxe and a quiver full of arrows, sometimes\ntipped with poison or barbed. A wealthier archer would probably have a\nshortsword as well, of Elven make of course. The armour of the Silvan\nsentinel is light as well, easily able to blend in with its\nsurroundings, whatever they may be. Indeed, the famous Lorien cloaks\nperform just this task. Apart from a cloak or mantle, the archer has a\nleather shirt, leggings, greaves, gauntlets, etc. He is very lightly\narmoured, for he is not expected to be heard by his enemy by the\njostling of mail or be forced into a prolonged fight. However a richer,\nmore elite archer may wear partial chainmail (always Elven made).\nEffectiveness ﻿ A sentinel is quite deadly, provided he is well armed\nand he is covered by a woodland surrounding. His aim is not to hit and\nrun, but rather to wipe out any foul and evil creature seen lurking in\nhis zone of patrol, without being seen. During the War of the Ring, the\nsentinels were hard put to defending their borders, for the shadow of\nDol Guldur had launched reparative raids on both woodland realms,\nultimately culminating in the Battle Under the Trees, when the\nsentinel's finest hour had arrived. During the battle, the forces of Dol\nGuldur were beaten back from Lórien and Thranduil's Halls and eventually\nthe Hill of Sorcery itself was laid bare by the White Lady of Lórien\nherself, Galadriel. This proves that the Silvan sentinel's effectiveness\ngoes far and beyond that of any other woodsman in Middle-earth. Decline\nof the Sentinel After the War of the Ring, Mirkwood was made fair again\nbut the time of the Sindar had ended in Middle-earth. Thus, the Silvan\nElves, who were of the Avari, remained in their dwindling kingdoms, but\neventually their people dwindled as well, so much so that they became\nonly a memory, a legend of elder days. The World has changed, Arda has\nbeen reshaped, but in the few forests that still exist on this earth, an\nancient spirit or two of the Avari wardens may continue to dwell that\nhas yet to see the final chapter of its history.

History Prelude After Aragorn with Gimli,\nLegolas, the sons of Elrond Elladan and Elrohir and the Grey Company had\nsummoned the Army of the Dead at the Stone of Erech, they planned their\nnext move. It had been known that a fleet of Haradrim Corsairs of Umbar\nwas making its way up the Anduin to reinforce the Enemy who had overrun\nthe Pelennor and besieged Minas Tirith. Thus, Aragorn and company\ndecided to intercept the fleet before they reached Minas Tirith, and\nthen hopefully use the enemy vessels to swiftly move up the Anduin and\nbreak the siege. As they made their way through Gondor's western\nprovinces, they gradually gathered more and more reinforcements. The\nBattle On March 13, 3019, Aragorn along with the Grey Company, and their\nnew reinforcements which included mercenary archers from the Blackroot\nVale near Erech, infantry from Lebennin and Lamedon and many other\ncavalry and mercenary infantry finally intercepted the enemy fleet at\nPelargir, a famous port city on the lower Anduin known for its skilled\nmariners. The corsairs had foolishly delayed their arrival at the\nPelennor by stopping at port towns along their way to loot and pillage\nthem. While they were just about to do the same at Pelargir, Aragorn's\nforces showed just in time to give them battle in the streets and\nharbour of the city. The moderately sized force of Aragorn was able to\ntriumph over the much greater corsair force by systematically defeating\nsmall units of men who were spread throughout the city. The Army of the\nDead's actual chief weapon was fear, which drove the corsairs manning\nthe ships to flee their vessels and jump overboard, without giving\nbattle. In just a short time, Aragorn's forces had freed Pelargir from\nthe corsair threat and had wrested control of their vessels, opening the\nway to a speedy relief of the siege of Minas Tirith. After the Battle\nAragorn's army, now reinforced with mariners from Pelargir, could now\nsail up the Anduin unopposed, but first Aragorn had to disband the much\nhelpful Army of the Dead. Instead of taking them to fight at the\nPelennor Fields, Aragorn decided to hold their oath fulfilled and thus\nfreed them of their living dead, much to their King's satisfaction. With\nthe Corsairs force defeated, Aragorn's army quickly loaded the vessels\nat Pelargir and set off up the Anduin to relieve the siege of Minas\nTirith.",

A\nmember of the Éoherë can serve a term or on a permanent basis. History\nDuring the first three hundred-plus years of Rohan's existence, the term\n“Éored” was used widely to describe any significant number of Riders.\nUnder Folcwine King son of Folca, fourteenth King of the Mark, the\nmilitary of Rohan was reordered. Under Folcwine, one Éored was made up\nof 120 riders including their captain. Each Éored was also supposed to\ncomprise one one-hundredth of the whole Muster of Rohan, not including\nthe household of the King. An Éored was a group of trained warriors who\nrode as a unit. Under the military reorganization in the time of King\nFolcwine, the size of a full Éored was determined to be at least 120\nmen. One Éored was one hundredth of the Éoherë - the full muster of\nRohan. The Riders of an Éored could serve for a term or on a permanent\nbasis. A Captain led each Éored. In times of war or unrest, the Marshals\nof the Mark each had a battle-ready Éored as part of his household,\nwhich he could command at his discretion. The changes made by Folcwine\nlasted through the time of the War of the Ring. While the Éoherë\ncommanded by Théoden King son of Thengel at the Battle of the Pelennor\nFields did not number much more than half of the 12,000 riders supossed\nto be a full muster of Rohan, it was possibly the largest riding of the\nRohirrim in history. Éowyn (disguised as a Rider named Dernhelm) and\nMerry Brandybuck rode with the Éored commanded by Elfhelm to the Battle\nof the Pelennor Fields on March 15. When the Rohirrim charged onto the\nbattlefield, Éomer led the first Éored in the center while Elfhelm's\nÉored was on the right flank and Grimbold's was on the left flank and\nthe other companies followed behind. King Théoden rode before them all.\nEtymology The word ÉOHERË comes from the Anglo-Saxon Old English (which\nthe tongue of Rohan was modelled after); it is made up of the words EOH\nmeaning “horse” and HERË meaning “army.” Likewise Éored contains the\nwords 'eoh' and 'rád' (horse, riding or rode). pl:Éoherë"

They tell him that they had\ncome from the Dúnedain encampment of Sarn Ford, where they and their\nfellow rangers led by Halbarad, are attacked by nine Black Riders. After\nthey had slaughtered the rangers, it was then that Agandaur had arrived\nand met with the Witch King, telling him that he has gathered his army\nof orcs at the old city of Fornost. Aragorn tells them to head straight\nfor Fornost, telling them that the host gathered there could be perilous\nto his mission (the mission to meet with the Hobbit, Frodo Baggins, and\nbring him to Rivendell). At Fornost, Eradan, Andriel and Farin are\nattacked by hordes of goblins and orcs. They also free a Great Eagle\nnamed Beleram, and join with Elladan and Elrohir, the twin sons of Lord\nElrond. Eventually, the group arrives at the citadel in the center of\nthe city, where Agandaur is based. Before Eradan and his companions can\nconfront Agandaur, they are attacked by the orc chieftain Tharzog and\nhis guards. They eventually kill Tharzog, and confront Agandaur at the\ntop of the citadel, who has overpowered the elf twins, but he escapes on\na Fell beast. Despite pursuit from Beleram, Agandaur still evades them\nby calling upon a storm with his power of sorcery. Eradan, Andriel and\nFarin return to the encampment at Sarn Ford, where they tell Halbarad\nwhat had transpired at Fornost. As Eradan and his companions make ready\nto leave for Rivendell, at the elf twins' behest, Halbarad asks them if\nthey could search for two of his missing rangers: Luin and Kilaran, who\nended up lost in the Barrow-downs. Eradan politely agrees. Once there,\nhowever, they are attacked by the Barrow-wights, the undead spirits that\nhaunt the tombs of the Downs. As they venture through the tombs, they\neventually find Luin, who tells them that the wights have taken Kilaran.\nThey eventually find Kilaran, who is possessed by a Barrow-wight Lord.\nDespite Eradan's protests of killing a fellow ranger, he eventually\nkills him, thereby killing the Wight Lord, as well. Eradan and the\nothers offer to help Luin bring Kilaran's body back to Sarn Ford and\nbury him, but Luin says he will take care of himself. And so, Eradan and\nhis companions can continue on their way. They eventually arrive at\nRivendell, where they meet Lord Elrond and Aragorn, as well as Gandalf\nthe Grey. They tell Eradan and his friends about Aragorn's quest, which\nwas to bring four Hobbits from the Shire here to Rivendell, one of them\ncarrying Isildur's Bane (the One Ring). To that end, they told them that\nthey had a plan to form a fellowship of Nine Walkers who would journey\nto Mordor and destroy the Ring; Gandalf and Aragorn are already members.\nEradan and his friends wish to join as well, but Elrond tells them that\nthe choices have already been made. Elrond does, however, tell them that\nthey could help him with a problem arising in the Ettenmoors, to which\nEradan and his friends gladly accept. Before leaving for the Ettenmoors,\nEradan meets Frodo Baggins, the Hobbit who carries the One Ring. He also\nmeets Legolas, one of the wood-elves; Gimli the dwarf and his father\nGloin; Bilbo Baggins, Frodo's uncle; and lady Arwen Evenstar, Lord\nElrond's daughter, who has promised herself to Lord Aragorn. Eradan and\nhis companions also bring to Elrond a scroll they found in Fornost made\nby a group of dark sorcerers called The Cult of the Lidless Eye, which\ncontain writings of the Black Speech. They also give him a tome, which\nis revealed to belong to Malbeth, the seer of Arthedain. As they soon\narrive at the Ettenmoors, they are in no time at all attacked by orcs\nand mountain-trolls. They soon are met once again by Beleram, who tells\nthem he has come to the Ettenmoors to help his kin track down a renegade\nstone giant named Bargrisar. After killing off many orcs, Eradan and his\ncompanions eventually find Bargrisar and, with Beleram's aid, defeat\nhim. After the giant is killed, Beleram's master, Lord Gwaihir, arrives.\nHe thanks the heroes for their help, and agrees to let Beleram journey\nwith them, along with two other eagles Baranthor and Armenel. When they\nreturn to Rivendell, Eradan and his friends bring to him war gear they\nhad taken from their fallen enemies, which bare Agandaur's black raven\nemblem. They also tell Elrond that Agandaur is marshalling an army, to\nwhich Elrond believes that if he were to build an army, he would have\ngone to Mount Gundabad.",

    "text": "_“The lesser rings were only essays of the craft before it was\nfull-grown, and to the Elven-smiths they were but trifles...”_ ''-\n''Gandalf in _The Fellowship of the Ring_, “Shadow of the Past” MAGIC\nRINGS are only mentioned a handful of times in _The Lord of the Rings_;\nmagic rings, or lesser rings, are rings with magic powers (powers\nunidentified), but less potent. They were made around the same time as\nthe Rings of Power and there were, presumably, many of them since “In\nEregion long ago many Elven-rings were made” and there are only twenty\nRings of Power, unless twenty is considered “many” rings. Gandalf states\nthat though the Elves who forged them thought little of them, he still\nthinks they are dangerous for mortals. They are lesser rings of the\nRings of Power, forged by the Elves as “essays in the craft”- they bore\nno gem (similar to the One Ring). History In the ancient days of the\nSecond Age, before the Fall of Númenor, many rings were forged, the\ncraft being taught by Sauron. These rings aided in the use of spells and\nmagical craft, and thus were widely popular with the Elves. Sauron, then\nknown as “Lord of the Gifts” claimed he wished to make Middle-earth as\nfair as Valinor, and it seemed he convinced the elves to think these\nrings could do so. After the forging of the One Ring, Sauron began\ndrawing these lesser rings to himself. This was not difficult, for the\nOne Ring gave him the strength to subdue the wielders of these powerful\nartifacts. Once gathered, Sauron could disperse them among his captains,\nmaking them all mighty champions whom he could back up at will with his\nown strength via the magic ring connection. After the Last Alliance of\nElves and Men and the First Fall of Sauron, these rings were dispersed\nthrough the land. Some were taken from dead warriors, others, borne away\nby the frightened, still living servants of Sauron, others were lost and\nlittle is known of what happened to them until the War of the Ring. At\nthe time of the War of the Ring, Sauron gathered again the lesser rings\nto himself. But this time, he kept a great deal of them so as to advance\nhis own abilities. Though not stated in the books or movies, it seems\nreasonable to believe that some were given again to his commanders as\nwell, and logically some were lost or destroyed before they could be\nreclaimed.  Their ultimate fates are unknown, nor is it known whether or\nnot their powers were bound to the power of the One Ring. If they were,\nthen their power would have failed with the destruction of the One.\nPowers The full extent of the rings' power is unknown, but Gandalf says\nthat “none are to be used lightly”. They were, to an extent, like the\nOne Ring when it came to temptation. They would give a being strength,\nmagical ability, and the power to dominate other wills. It is also\nbelieved (though again, not stated) that these rings also had certain\nfields in which they were strongest. For example, one ring may rule over\nstone, while another controls ice. This, however, is not known fact, and\nonly stems from what is known about the Rings of Power, assuming that\nthe lesser rings are much like them."

Tu is described as a “wizard” or “fay” who ruled\nthe Dark-Elves of the further east of Middle-earth around Cuievenan just\nbefore the making of the Sun. One of his subjects, Nuin Father of\nSpeech, came to a hidden valley of great loveliness and found there\nsleeping figures young but not children, boys and girls: the Fathers of\nMen. He told this to Tu, who fell into great fear of the One, and told\nNuin that these were the Fathers of Men, who were to be undisturbed.\nNotes then tell that Nuin awoke two of the Sleepers, Ermon and Elmir,\nand taught them speech; that Tu and Nuin shepherded the Sleepers when\nthey awoke with the Sun, and that Men split into factions in the years\nafterward. Tu grew to shun day and took to dwelling underground. A demon\nnamed Fankil, son of Melkor, arose and set Men at each other's throats,\nand especially against the Elves. The folk of Ermon stood with the\nElves, but Tu came forth and destroyed Fankil, and was buried under\nfalling hills.

History Background After Bilbo Baggins' 111th\nbirthday party, the One Ring was passed onto his nephew, Frodo Baggins.\nAfter Gandalf returned from Gollum's interrogation, he ordered Frodo and\nSamwise Gamgee to flee from The Shire and meet him at The Prancing Pony\nin Bree. Upon leaving, Frodo and Sam met with Merry and Pippin, who\ndecided to join them in their quest to Bree.

After Frodo accidentally placed on the One Ring, Aragorn,\ndisguised as a man named Strider, pulled Frodo to another section of The\nPrancing Pony to tell him that their journey is not over and they must\njourney to Rivendell where the ring will be in safer hands. The group\nstopped at Weathertop as night was coming. As Aragorn left to gather\nmore supplies and look out for intruders, the Nazgûl found the Hobbits\nand chased them to the top of Weathertop where the battle was to begin.\nThe Battle The Hobbits attacked the Nazgûl as the battle began. Due to\ntheir inexperience with Swords and combat, the Hobbits were no match\nagainst the Nazgûl and were defeated with minor wounds. The Witch-king\nof Angmar then realized that Frodo had the One Ring and approached him\nduring the battle. Aragorn arrived before more damage could be done onto\nthe Hobbits. He fought against the Nazgûl and was able to drive most of\nthem away. However, noticing the Witch-King approaching, Frodo put on\nthe One Ring in attempt to hide from the Witch-King. That proved to have\nno effect when the Witch-king saw him in the wraith-world, and stabbed\nhis shoulder with a Morgul-blade. Frodo fainted, but took off the Ring\nbefore losing consciousness completely. Aragorn was able to drive the\nrest of the Nazgûl off, but Frodo had sustained a wound that would haunt\nhim in the years after. The Nazgûl escaped but Frodo was left poisoned\nby the Witch-king's dagger and required healing from the Elves."

Their armor was similar to the rest of Saruman's Uruk-hai\nconsisting of a steel segmented breastplate, greaves, a helmet and\ngauntlets which often varied in appearance and quality due to being\nproduced by crude orc smiths.

    "text": "History Background In the ages prior to the sun, Arda was reformed by\nthe massive energy released when Melkor destroyed the original light\nsources, the two Lamps. The Valar fled the razing to the newly formed\ncontinent of Aman and built Valinor, while Melkor reigned unchecked in\nthe new continent of Middle-earth, where he corrupted the surviving\nbeasts. Unaware of these designs, the Valar did not approach him for\nfear that the confrontation would be just as world-devastating as the\nextinguishment of the light. Their priority was to protect the original\nplan of creation, though they were unsure of what was salvageable. They\ndid not know if Eru's personal creations, elves and men, would now ever\ncome into being after the catastrophe. Fortunately, the elves did come\nto being; however, they appeared in Middle-earth near Cuiviénen.\nWithdrawn, the Valar were unaware of this. On the other hand, Melkor was\nquickly learned of this through his spies. Soon, elves who wandered too\nfar from their lands were captured and taken to the fortresses of\nAngband and Utumno. There, in Melkor's utmost contempt for Eru and his\nsole ability to create life, they were corrupted through torture into\nservants bred solely for war - orcs. Sometime later, while on a hunting\ntrip in Middle-earth, the Valar Oromë stumbled upon the elves that were\nunharmed. After realizing what they were, he asked them to return with\nhim to Valinor for their protection. While the majority of them agreed,\na some refused, believing him to be their kidnapper. When Oromë returned\nwith the elves willing to leave with him, the Valar were made aware of\norcs. Their creation was most-likely seen as the worst imaginable\noffense. Manwë and the rest of the Valar could stand this no longer, and\nso the Valar took counsel with each other and decided to rid\nMiddle-earth of Melkor's tyranny. The War Soon, the Valar declared war\non Melkor, presumably a massive army of light and battled him for many\ndecades. The Host of the Valar easily defeated Melkor's host at the\nBattle of the Powers in northwestern Middle-earth. The remnant of his\nforces fled back to Utumno and fortified themselves there. The Valar\npassed over Middle-earth and placed a guard over Cuiviénen to protect\nthe elves from any further effects of the war or perhaps from an attack\nfrom Melkor's servants. Then, the Host of the Valar went north to Utumno\nand besieged it. After decades of siege, the Host of the Valar finally\nbroke through and after Tulkas himself personally defeated Melkor in\ncombat, they captured him and took him to Valinor for judgment, and\nsentenced him to prison in the Halls of Mandos for thousands of years.\nAftermath The war between the two powers devastated the lands of\nMiddle-earth and the face of the continent was changed. The distance\nbetween Middle-earth and Aman separated by the Great Sea became wider. A\nGulf in south was created and small bays appeared between the Great Gulf\nand Helcaraxë. The Mountains of Hithlum and the highlands of the\nDorthonion were created. The Sirion river that flowed into the newly\nformed Bay of Balar appeared. Free of evil, the elves were invited to\nValinor and undertook a Great Journey across Middle-earth in which new\nElven cultures were developed. The result was the peopling and\ncolonisation of the western parts of Middle-earth with the Children of\nIlúvatar. Legacy The main legacy of war was that it allowed the Elves to\ngo to Aman and Valinor where they became High Elves, enlightened,\ncultured, and skilled. Elves in Middle-earth established themselves\nlearning much of nature, woodlore, and shipbuilding. However, the fear\nbrought about by Melkor caused some elves to relent and stay in the east\nlonger. These elves, the Avari and the rest of the Dark Elves developed\nseparate and more secretive cultures and stayed away from the affairs of\ntheir long loss brethren for the most part. They would then thousands\nand thousands of years later in the Third and Fourth Ages become the\nWood-elves that would be the last of the kindreds of left in\nMiddle-earth ever after. The languages of the elves spread throughout\nMiddle-earth and blended and influenced other tongues and became known\nof ever after. The other legacy was that Melkor, then released from\nprison who would ever after remember that his downfall was because of\nthe Elves sought revenge thus causing the Revolt of the Ñoldor and the\nWar of the Jewels and the battles and dramas that followed. It would\nalso serve to shape the course of the history of the Children of\nIlúvatar for ages to come."

Tolkien participated in the battle and witnessed firsthand\nthe carnage, suffering, and terrible losses of life. The result was that\nit was to have a profound effect on Tolkien's works, most notably _The\nLord of the Rings_. Tolkien's good friends Robert Gilson and Geoffrey\nBache Smith were killed in the battle. History The battle started on the\n1 July 1916 after a heavy artillery bombardment on the German lines that\nhad begun a week before on 24 June 1916. The battle was intended to be a\ndecisive breakthrough for the allies against the Central Powers, but it\ndid not turn out that way. The battle ended on the 18 November 1916. In\nthe space of just over four months, the battle produced over one million\ncasualties and was indecisive and although the allies gained ground\n(only five miles total) they did not break through the German lines and\nwin the war. The battle was fought on the Western Front in the\nnorth-central Somme and southeastern Pas-de-Calais Départements, of\nFrance. Tolkien's role Tolkien's involvement in the battle lasted from\nJuly to October 1916 during which he served as a Battalion Signalling\nOfficer to the 11th Battalion of The Lancashire Fusiliers. His unit\noperated mainly in the northern section of the Somme and was stationed\nin the Beaumont-Hamel, Serre, and Leipzig salient trenches. He was in\nthe Battle of Thiepval Ridge and helped captured the Regina Trench from\nthe Germans for a time. The filthy and wretched conditions of the\ntrenches and areas of battle along with stress caused Tolkien to come\ndown with Trench fever and Trench foot, which put him out of the war\npermanently. Aftermath and Effects on Writing While in hospital\nrecovering from his diseases of war, Tolkien did much writing where his\nexperiences in the battle were where many of the ideas for the terrible\nbattles of the War of the Ring and the epic Fall of Gondolin, which were\noutlined in _The Lord of the Rings_ and the _Book of Lost Tales_.\nAnother theme which grew out of Tolkien's participation in the battle\nwas the struggles of ordinary peoples in extraordinary situations and\nthat the smallest of people can make big contributions and differences.\nPossibly, Tolkien was inspired by the great potential, bravery, and\nhardiness he saw in the ordinary low-ranked citizen soldiers that fought\nin the battle."

History At the bidding of\nManwë, who was grieved by the Hiding of Valinor, Lorien, the Master of\nDreams and Visions, created the Path of Dreams, which was a place beyond\nthe mortal realm which connected Middle-earth and Valinor through the\ndream. When the Children of Ilúvatar sleep, their spirit is guided by\nLorien to his gardens, which was the fairest place in the world, and\nthere they rest until Lorien returns them to their bodies when morning\narrives or when they need to wake up. The Olórë Mallë was a lane of deep\nbanks and great overhanging hedges, beyond which stood many tall trees\nwherein a perpetual whisper seemed to live. Great glow-worms, not the\ndark glow-worms that roam some parts of Middle-earth, crept about its\ngrassy borders. At the end of the lane stood a high gate of lattice-work\nthat shone golden in the dusk. The gate opened up to winding paths\nleading into the fairest of all the gardens, the Gardens of Lorien. In\n_The Lord of the Rings_, Legolas was seen sleeping but still fully aware\nof his surroundings. This happens because his mind was in the waking\ndream of the Olórë Mallë. The only time mortals can see the beauty of\nValinor and of the Gardens of Lorien was when they sleep and their\nspirits travel the Olórë Mallë."

    "text": "The RE-COLONIZATION OF MORIA was an attempt by Balin to rebuild the\nancient Dwarven Kingdom of Moria in TA 2989 to TA 2994. Under the\nleadership of Balin, the initial effort was successful, and for a while,\nthe Dwarves reclaimed some of Moria. However, the tide turned in favor\nof the goblins when the Balrog known as Durin's Bane emerged and led a\nmassive army of goblins in a counter-attack. No dwarf of the colony\nsurvived. History 48 years after the Battle of the Five Armies, Balin\nalong with Flói, Óin, Ori, Frár, Lóni, Náli, and a large colony of\nDwarves marched from the Lonely Mountain to Moria to reclaim the dwarven\ncity with the unwilling leave of Dain II Ironfoot as he feared what was\nthere. He hoped to reclaim some of the lost treasures of the lost realm\nlike the Ring of Thrór. The initial battles took place from the Dimrill\nDale to the Chamber of Mazarbul in which Flói was killed before they\nreached the First Hall. Nevertheless everything went well as the Dwarves\nproved to be fiercely determined to take back their home, slaying every\ngoblin in their path, eventually some of Moria was reclaimed and they\ndwelt in the Twenty-first Hall until Balin moved to the Chamber of\nMazarbul which then become his seat of government from then on. For the\nnext few years, Balin ruled as Lord of Moria. The goblins became a mere\nnuisance during those years and were not serious threats. Here, Balin\nand company found Durin's Axe and some sort of 'helm'. Little did the\nDwarves know, that Moria was ruled by a Balrog, a demon of the Eldar\nDays that survived in the deeps for many thousands of years that the\nDwarves were no match for. By the year TA 2994, Durin's Bane and a horde\nof goblins launched a massive counterattack from the east. Balin was\nshot by an archer and died in Dimrill Dale and many other Dwarves\nperished as well and retreated into the mines. Bloody fighting took\nplace all over Moria, but the strength of the Dwarves were ultimately no\nmatch for the sheer number of goblins and the power of the Balrog. Soon\nthe Bridge of Khazad-dum and the Second Hall were taken by the goblins.\nFrár and Lóni and Náli were among the casualties the Dwarves lost in the\nsecond hall. Oin and a group of Dwarves tried to escape through the\nDoors of Durin but were killed by the Watcher in the Water. The last\nDwarves barred the doors of the Chamber of Mazarbul and were able to\nbuilt a tomb for Balin. Eventually, the goblins broke through and slew\nthe remaining Dwarves ending the peaceful re-colonization of Moria.\nAftermath With the Dwarven colony destroyed, Moria continued to be a\nplace of evil that none dared enter until the Fellowship of the Ring\nlearned of it when they passed through it, slaying Durin's Bane in the\nprocess."

In TA 2790 when\nThrór grew old and decided to go off on an adventure of his own to the\nMines of Moria, the map was given to his son Thráin for safe-keeping. In\nTA 2841, Thráin left his home in the Blue Mountains with a small company\nto try his luck with the map, intending to reach the Lonely Mountain\ndespite the threat from Smaug, but he never got there. Instead, he was\ntaken prisoner by the Orcs of Dol Guldur and imprisoned in its dungeons\nby Sauron. Sauron took his Dwarven Ring of Power.

Though perhaps most known as one\nof the foremost military and sporting weapons used by European knights,\nthe use of lances was spread throughout the Old World wherever mounts\nwere available. As a secondary weapon, lancers of the period also bore\nsword, mace or something else suited to close quarter battle, since the\nlance was often a one-use-per-engagement weapon; assuming the lance\nsurvived the initial impact intact, it was (depending the lance) far too\nlong, heavy and slow to be effectively used against opponents in a\nmelee."

    "text": "The FIRST SACK OF DORIATH, or the SACK OF MENEGROTH, was an attack on\nDoriath by the Dwarves of Nogrod in the late First Age. Background The\ncause of the attack was the Dwarves' desire to possess the Silmaril, set\nin the dwarven-made jewel, the Nauglamir, for themselves. After the two\ntreasures were brought together, Thingol sought to take it and set about\nit his neck but the Dwarves withheld it from him, saying that he hadn't\nthe right to do so as it was a dwarven heirloom taken from Nargothrond\nby theft. Then in a gesture of great pride, Thingol scorned the dwarves\nas inferiors undeserving in comparison to himself and proceeded to speak\nill of them, deeming they should be gone out of his realm forever.\nInsulted and ever wanting the Silmaril, the Dwarves' hearts kindled to\nrage and they fell upon him and there was a great battle within the\npalace, Thingol was seemingly defeated, and took the Nauglamir and the\nSilmaril, but were driven out of the fortress. The Dwarves left\nMenegroth, but it didn't take long for the alarm to be raised on what\nhad been done, and soon all of Doriath was roused. With great wrath, the\ndwarves were pursued to the death and all but two returned home to\nNogrod. When they arrived, the survivors lied about what really\nhappened, saying that their brothers had been slain at the command of\nthe Thingol, hoping to cheat them of their reward. The Dwarves of Nogrod\nthen became filled will wrath and desired revenge. They tried to get the\nDwarves of Belegost to help them but they refused. Later the Dwarves\nwere allowed past the Girldle with the help of treacherous elves who\nwere under the curse of the treasure. Meanwhile Thingol was lured out of\nthe fortress on a hunt with only a small company of arms. The dwarves\nwere waiting for him an ambush finally slew the king, and the fortress\nof the THousand Caves was taken unawares and plundered, bringing well\nnigh to ruin the glory of Doriath. Melian, full of grief and pain at the\nloss of her husband and seeing that that the doom she had so feared had\nfinally come upon Doriath, withdrew her protection of the realm. The\ndwarves could neither harm nor seize her and she went forth... Here\nthere is a split in the accounts... In Beren and Luthien (2017) to\nsought after Beren and Luthien, to warn hem of the Dwarves approach.\nGiving them a chance with help of the Green Elves to stop the Dwarves at\nthe battle of the Stony Ford. Melien also tells Beren the dangers of the\nMim's cursed treasure, and has discussions with her daughter Luthien.\nShe gives the Silmaril to Beren for safe keeping. In time Luthien faded,\nand Beren died, and their son Dior became heir to Doriath (taking the\nSilmaril with him) and helped raise its glory anew, though Melian dwelt\nin that place, and she returned back to and of the Gods. Alternatively\nanother somewhat later account (closer to how it appears in The\nSilmarillion (1977)) Dior leaves later while his family was still alive\nand become the new king of Doriath. It was when Green Elves brought him\na coffer with the Necklace of the Dwarves, that he knew his parents had\ndied. He stared at the Silmaril long with grief that death had come upon\nhis parents so soon. In the Silmarillion (1977), the co-author Guy Kay\nwas tasked with coming up with an explanation for why the girdle/veil of\nMelian was brought down to allow dwarves back into the city to sack it.\nIt is not clear how much of it was J.R. Tolkiens ideas and how much of\nit was Guy Kay's but Unfinished Tales and HoMe series attribute much of\nthat chapter as a construction of Kays. In the story as it appears in Of\nthe Sacking of Doriath, she entrusted Mablung to send word to Beren at\nTol Galen and gave him the Silmaril for safe-keeping. She then left\nMiddle-earth and returned to Valinor leaving Doriath vulnerable. As per\nHoMe Christopher Tolkien mentions never being fully happy with having\nused a construction (that was not wholly of his fathers) and in\nhindsight and with discovery of later works of his father (which\nincluded the intent to go back and incorporate much of the elements of\nthe earlier stories), he admits he could have retained much the elements\nof both accounts, with very little editorial involvement (and should\nhave included the extended parts of the story). In the 2017 Beren and\nLuthien work, he has reached that goat to a certain degree. The Attack\nThe Dwarves of Nogrod assembled a great host and marched out of the Blue\nMountains, crossing the river Gelion, and headed westward to Doriath.\nCrossing the Aros River, the Dwarves reached Doriath with no magical\nenchantments (i.e. the Girdle of Melian) or barriers to stop them. The\nElven sentinels and their captains there were no match for them, and\nwere quickly defeated; then with few losses the Dwarves passed over the\ngreat Bridge of Menegroth, and entered the caves thus beginning the\nBattle of the Thousand Caves. After fierce fighting in which many on\nboth sides were killed, they were victorious and pillaged, plundered,\nand destroyed at their leisure and much was taken from the Great Hall of\nThingol. Then, they came to the the treasury and slew Mablung before its\ndoors and took the Nauglamir and the Silmaril. Afterwards The Dwarves\nleft Doriath but didn't live to enjoy the fruits of their victory. At\nSarn Athrad, they were ambushed by an army of Laiquendi led by Beren\nwith his son Dior. The Dwarven host, heavily weighed-down with loot,\nwere destroyed and the survivors that fled into the forest ran into the\nEnts and were killed. The Silmaril and Nauglamir were taken by Beren to\nTol Galen. This marked the end of the first kingdom of Doriath until\nDior and his wife Nimloth came to refounded it later ruling over the\nsurviving Sindar, soon afterwards."

    "title": "Origin of Dragons",
    "page_id": "22367",
    "text": "There is significant debate over the ORIGINS OF DRAGONS in Middle-earth.\nExtreme Intelligence [Tolkien's portraits about his ideas of dragons in\nMiddle-Earth. Dragons were known to be very intelligent. This has led\nmany to think that the theory which suggests that dragons are merely\ncorrupted beasts is false. For example David Day writes,  “The\nintelligence of Dragons was renowned, as was their love of setting and\nsolving riddles. Dragons . . . were creatures of immense cleverness and\nknowledge but not of wisdom, for their intelligence had the flaws of\nvanity, gluttony, greed, deceit and wrath.” Different Theories - The\ntheory that Dragons were simply beasts physically enhanced by Morgoth,\nsuch as corrupted eagles, is a very popular theory, but there are issues\nwith this line of thought. Randall Johnson writes: “Dragons understand\nmany tongues, and they are known for speaking in riddles. Dragons are\nvery intelligent, able to lead armies into battle. Dragons are able to\npetrify and hypnotize with but a glance of their eyes.  Dragons cast\nspells and curses. Some Dragons breathe fire. These properties and\npowers are not characteristic of simple beasts”. Another problem is, of\ncourse that dragons did not originally have wings.   - The theory that\ndragons are sparks of the spirit of Melkor has merit. According to this\ntheory, Melkor bred monstrous reptiles and poured a portion of his own\nspirit into them, giving them semi-independent wills and\nconsciousnesses.   - One theory claims that dragons find their origins\nin Yavanna's creation; they were born to be part of Arda's ecosystems\njust as other animals, or were specifically created to serve as\nguardians who would protect the harmony and peace of nature like the\nEagles. These beasts were then later (or even before the spread of their\nraces across Arda) altered and corrupted by the Dark Lord and adopted\ninto his forces. Gigantic reptilian races such as dinosaurs, Megalanias,\nTitanoboas, and the Fell Beasts might or might not have shared their\norigins with dragons according to this theory. This fits with the origin\nof Orcs, which are descended from corrupted Elves as well as the\nassertion that only Eru is capable of creating life.   - The next theory\nis that dragons are simply embodied Maiar much like the Balrogs. This\ntheory avoids many of the problems of the previous ideas on draconic\norigins. According to this theory, dragons are Maiar, ancient spirits in\nthe form of gigantic, serpentine monsters. The fact that Maiar have the\nability to take on corporeal forms has been established\npreviously. Melkor's deadly allies, the Balrogs, were Maiar in the\nraiment of fire and shroud. The Wizards were Maiar in the form of Men or\nElves.   - The final theory is that dragons are actually descendants of\nembodied Maiar and beasts (more likely monsters or Nameless Things) much\nlike Ungoliant procreates with spiders. This theory is generally\nconsidered to have great strength by Middle-earth experts. Johnson\nwrites: “ theory contends that at some point in time, a Maia, according\nto the bidding of Melkor, assumed a bodily form genetically compatible\nwith an existing reptile. Recall that Sauron himself took the form of a\nserpent. 'Then Sauron shifted shape, from wolf to serpent, and from\nmonster to his own accustomed form.' (Silmarillion, 212) This\nserpent-Maia mated with the reptile, procreating the first Dragon,\nGlaurung. Glaurung then mated either with other existing reptiles or\nwith other serpent-Maiar in order to reproduce.  Eventually, the Dragons\nbecame a self-sustainable race.”"

When\nthey were originally bred in the First Age, the Orcs had little more\nlanguage than beasts, but borrowed what they could from other languages\nand corrupted it to their liking. In the Second Age, Sauron corrupted\nand combined Valarin and Quenya to create Black Speech, which he\nintended to make the official language of all who served him. He\nultimately failed in this purpose, although several generations of Orcs\nwere probably bred in Mordor and raised on this language before the War\nof the Last Alliance. After Sauron's defeat at the end of the Second Age\nthe Orcs were divided. Eventually they had almost as many dialects as\nthey had groups and settlements, and “Orkish” quickly became useless to\nthem for inter-breed communication. So most Orcs learned to speak a\ndebased form of Westron for this purpose. By the late Third Age the\nGoblin tribes of the Misty Mountains adopted this primitive dialect as\ntheir official language, and Saruman later had it taught to the\nHalf-orcs and Uruk-hai of Isengard. The Black Uruks and Uruk-hai of\nMordor also spoke Westron, but their first language was a debased form\nof Black Speech combined with Orkish. There was also a new breed of\nsmall tracker Orcs known as “Snufflers” originally bred in Mordor. These\nparticular Orcs spoke Westron in the company of Uruk-hai and Black\nUruks, which meant that they did not share the same language, and\ninstead had their own language or knew only Westron."

It is unknown what happened to\nthe purse after its owner was turned to stone. Origin It is unknown what\nthese creatures are or where they came from. They couldn't have been\nmade by Trolls (Trolls can't make much of anything) as even Morgoth can\nonly alter (not truly create) life. They could have been bred by\nSauron for the purpose of making sure that important goods carried by\ntrolls could not be stolen. However (since it would be strange to create\nsuch a being just for trolls); it is likely that they go all the way\nback to the First Age, bred by Morgoth to resemble purses. In this case,\nthey were probably used by spies and thieves.   If one of the\npre-mentioned possibilities is correct, then trolls probably took these\n\"purses' for themselves after the fall of Sauron at the end of\nthe Second Age. Either trolls figured out how to breed them; or the\npurses live forever and were antiques among trolls (unlikely). Apart\nfrom the pre-mentioned, the only other possibilities are; they are\ncreatures that have an uncanny resemblance to purses, or they were\nanimals of some sort decorated to look like purses. It is unknown\nwhether trolls actually keep their valuables in the troll purses; or if\nthey keep their valuables else-where and the troll purse is just a lure.\nIf the latter is the case; then the fourth and fifth possibilities are\nmore likely than the first three (and vice versa). Given that when Bilbo\ntook the troll purse from WIlliam's pocket it yelled; “'Ere, 'oo are\nyou?”, we can either assume that troll purses are sentient, or are\ntrained to respond in certain ways."

Traveling down the\ntunnel for hours, Bilbo conferred with himself as to the reason for him\ndoing this and going on this adventure to begin with, and that the\nTookish part of him was at work. Towards the end if it due to Smaug, the\ntunnel grew warmer and warmer until it became quite hot. After Bilbo\nemerged from the tunnel with news of Smaug's anger, the Dwarves feared\nhe would find out where they were and kill them so they all entered the\ntunnel and sought refuge in the mountain.

It was so thin that it could be used by inscribers\nto write special runes, known as moon-letters, such as those on Thorin\nOakenshield's map. It was enchanted so that it only appears in moonlight\nor starlight, and could be enchanted further so that it would never\nappear except on a specific phase of the moon on a specific night, or\nonly when certain words were uttered in its presence.

    "text": "EGALMOTH was an Ñoldorin Elf-lord of Gondolin during the First Age.\nBiography Egalmoth, along with Glorfindel and Ecthelion, was Aredhel's\nescort when she left Gondolin in search of the Sons of Fëanor. The\nescort was not admitted into Doriath and traveled to Ered Gorgoroth\ninstead. Egalmoth and his companions were separated from Aredhel and\nwhen they could not find her, they returned to Gondolin empty-handed.\nFall of Gondolin Egalmoth was the wealthy Lord of the House of the\nHeavenly Arch. He defended the realm with valor but after the fall of\nthe gate he was forced to flee, but not before gathering survivors.\nBefore their escape through Idril's Secret Way, he and Tuor fought the\nenemy in the Square. When it was clear that the situation was hopeless,\nhe escaped via the secret way thus surviving the Fall of Gondolin. He\nfled to the Mouths of Sirion with fellow survivors, and later died in\nthe attack by the Sons of Fëanor. Etymology The name _Egalmoth_ has\nunclear origins, though it is likely to have been Sindarin. The first\nelement _egal_ has many possibilities to its origin, including ''eglerio\n''or _egleria_ (“praise, glorify”), ''egnas ''(which is rather\nappropriately found in both Ñoldorin and Sindarin), or _êg_ (“sharp\npoint”), ''eglon ''or _eglir_ (which were names given to the Ñoldor by\nthe Sindar), or _egol_ (“forsaken”). The second component of 'Egalmoth'\nis likely to have come from the Sindarin word _moth_ (“dusk”).",

The Citadel\nwould have been around 500 feet across. Layout The Citadel is set out\nthis way: In the centre is the White Tower, rising to a great height.\nBehind is the large sprawling King's House, where the Kings of Gondor\nonce lived. In front of the tower is the Place of the Fountain, a\ncourtyard containing the White tree and a central fountain. Around the\nTower are ringed several other important buildings, including\nMerethrond, the Feasting Hall. The Citadel is accessed via a wide tunnel\nthrough the hill that leads to a small gate. The wide cliff narrows to\nits point around 200 feet beyond the Citadel. As with all the city's\nlevels, the Citadel has a high wall and seven towers. The Place of the\nFountain Probably the most important symbolic area of the city, the\nPlace of the Fountain was the home of the great White Tree. It was a\nlarge circular grass area, around 50 feet wide, with the White Tree\nbeing the central feature. The fountain was positioned some way before\nthe tree. It flowed into a small pool, then back round to the fountain.\nThe Tree symbolised Gondor, and was the flag and emblem of the City\nGuards. The Tree was grown from a seed of Nimloth, the tree given to the\nNúmenóreans by the Eldar. It was planted by Isildur, and grew to\nsymbolise the blessings of Men. But in the third age the tree was\nwithered, perhaps symbolising Minas Tirith's decline. It was only with\nthe crowning of Aragorn Elessar that a new sapling was founded, showing\nthe City's rise to glory under the new King. The Tower and other\nbuildings The Tower of Ecthelion is a tall white stone structure, rising\n300 feet above the citadel. The elevation of the city means it's topmost\nfloor is 1000 feet above the Pelennor Fields. It's name implies that it\nwas probably built by Denethor's father, Ecthelion, but it was possibly\nmuch older. The Tower was used as a main business building, and\ncontained several large council halls, and the imposing Throne Room. At\nthe summit was the small chamber where Denethor kept Minas Tirith's\nPalantir. At the very bottom of the Tower, there were several rooms for\nthe Guards of the City to live and work in. The House of Kings was a\nlarge building, with many halls and towers. As one of the main buildings\nin the city, it would have been around 100 feet long. It was designed to\naccommodate the King and royal family, visitors, guests and a large team\nof servants. The palace was no longer in use by the time Gandalf and\nPippin came to the city; the last King, Eärnur, having long since been\nkilled. The only other building Tolkien specifically mentioned was\nMerethrond, the Hall of Feasts. This is where important guests to the\ncity were entertained, and where important feasts and celebrations were\nheld. There were several other structures on the citadel, ringed around\nthe Tower, but none apart from the White Tower and the Feast Hall are\nimportant to the story of lord of the rings."

    "text": "The FALLS OF SIRION were the mighty thundering falls of the River\nSirion, just south of the Aelin-uial, where its waters fell beneath the\nearth and flowed under the hills of the Andram for nine leagues before\nemerging again at the Gates of Sirion. The Sirion's source was at Eithel\nSirion on the eastern side of the Ered Wethrin, which lay in between\nArd-galen (later Anfauglith) and Mithrim and Hithlum. It was guarded by\nthe tower of Barad Eithel. Course Sirion flowed southwards along the\nborder of the Ered Wethrin, passing through the Fen of Serech before\nentering the narrow steep-sided valley between the Ered Wethrin and the\nEchoriath named the Pass of Sirion. Sirion then continued south into\nBeleriand, with the Forest of Brethil to the west, and Dimbar and then\nDoriath to the east. After leaving Doriath at Aelin-uial (the Fens of\nSirion) it plunged below ground in the Falls of Sirion at Andram (the\nLong Wall), where the ground fell steeply. Three leagues southwards the\nSirion exited the underground caves at the Gates of Sirion. It then\nflowed southwards through Nan-Tathren until it reached the Bay of Balar,\npart of Belegaer, at the Mouths of Sirion. Tributaries In order from\nnorth to south, the principal tributaries of the Sirion were the Rivil,\nflowing from Dorthonion until it met Sirion in the Fen of Serech; the\nMindeb, which had its source in Nan Dungortheb and the Ered Gorgoroth,\nthe Teiglin, the Esgalduin of Doriath; theAros flowing south from\nDorthonion and west along the Forest of Region (and also containing the\nwaters of the Celon from the Hills of Himring and Himlad) which met at\nAelin-uial, and the Narog, which joined Sirion in Nan-Tathren. Crossing\nPoints The main crossing point was the Ford of Brithiach where the road\nfrom Himlad which crossed the Esgalduin at Iant Iaur crossed Sirion.\nKing Thingol of Doriath also kept secret ferries in Doriath to cross the\nriver. Settlements Barad Eithel, at the source of the Sirion in the Ered\nWethrin, was a chief fortress of Fingolfin and his son Fingon, which\nguarded the pass into their realm of Mithrim. Further south, in the Pass\nof Sirion, lay Tol Sirion (see below). After the Coming of Men, the\nEdainof the House of Haleth made their home in the Forest of Brethil,\nand the Sindar ruled by Thingol lay secure within the Girdle of Melian\nin their realm of Doriath. At the outflow of Sirion into Belegaer, after\nthe destruction of Eglarest and Brithombar, the Havens of Sirion were\nbuilt by Círdan and his people. Islands The most important island in\nSirion was Tol Sirion. The original Minas Tirith was built here by\nFinrod Felagund in the strategic location controlling the Pass of Sirion\nwhere it entered Beleriand between the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath.\nShortly after Dagor Bragollach it was captured by Sauron and the island\nbecame known as Tol-in-Gaurhoth. Etymology Sirion is a Sindarin/Noldorin\nname which contains the element sîr. Depending on the meaning of the\nsecond element, the name could either mean “great river” or “land of\nwaters” (-ion as augmentative suffix or archaic plural genitive suffix).\nIts name in Khuzdul was Gabilān, with the element Gabil - “Great”."

Three\ncenturies later, Azog was their leader. When Thror came to reclaim Moria\nwith Nar, Azog slew Thror, and this initiated The War of Dwarves and\nOrcs. The Dwarves hunted down Azog until he was killed by Dain II\nIronfoot at the Battle of Azanulbizar. (After Azog's death, his son Bolg\nwould lead an army of Orcs to Erebor, where they lost terribly, and Bolg\nwas killed.) When the Dwarves, led by Balin, returned to Moria in TA\n2989, they came upon bands of orcs who eventually invaded and overtook\nKhazad-dum, and Balin was slain. These orcs were not large in number or\nwell-armed, but sufficient to keep out any enemies. The Fellowship of\nthe Ring came upon a large group of Moria Orcs, led by an unknown large\norc chieftain, who ambushed them in Balin's Tomb. After the Fellowship\nleft the chamber they came upon other orcs and Cave-trolls who attempted\nto kill them as they neared the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. The Moria Orcs\nstopped due to the arrival of Durin's Bane, the ancient Balrog of the\nold kingdom. After the Balrog's defeat, Moria Orcs continued their hunt\nfor the Fellowship to Lothlórien where they were killed by the Elves\nliving there. While most Moria Orcs served Sauron, some of them fell\nunder the influence of the wizard Saruman or acted on their own behalf.\nSeveral of the Moria Orcs in the service of Saruman along fellow Mordor\nOrcs and Uruk-hai were sent by the old Istari to capture Frodo Baggins\nand get the One Ring. The orcs however took Meriadoc Brandybuck and\nPeregrin Took in place of Baggins and began their journey back to\nIsengard. At some point during this journey, the orcs of the Black Pit\ngrew hungry and began arguing with Uglúk about eating the two hobbits.\nUglúk had to prevent any riot so he killed several of the traitorous\norcs and warned the others. The surviving Moria Orcs were killed either\non the road by the Riders of Rohan or at night near Fangorn Forest by\nEomer's Rohirrim group. After the destruction of Isengard, these orcs\nwere driven out of Moria and the Dwarves reclaimed it.",

    "text": "DARK SORCERY, more commonly known as “witchcraft” or “Morgul magic” by\nthe Free People of Middle-earth, was art of practicing dark magic for\nevil purposes. Famous practitioners of dark sorcery are mostly dark\nservants of the infamous Dark Lords Melkor and Sauron. Its users, as\nwell as all human practitioners of magic, were called Sorcerers. The\nIstari used light magic, similar to the Elves and the Ainur in Valinor\nand outside of Arda, rather than dark sorcery. History Before his\ndefeat, the Dark Lord Morgoth (Melkor) had used dark sorcery in his\nfortress of Utumno and later Angband. He was most infamous for his\nexperiments in creating and mutilating monsters, including the orcs,\nWargs and Dragons and used much of his powers to corrupt Arda. Dark\nsorcery was also used in the Second and the Third Age by the Black\nNúmenóreans, a group of corrupted Númenóreans who grew during the later\nperiod of Númenor (especially after the arrival of Sauron) and who\nsurvived in the Númenórean colonies south of Gondor. Originally the\nstyled themselves as “King's Men” and persecuted The “Elf-friends”\nbecause of their loyalty to the Valar (The King's Men had grown jealous\nof the elves' immortality). After Sauron's arrival at Númenor they begun\nworshipping Melkor and the darkness they so feared, bringing human\nsacrifices to him. After the fall of Númenor the Black Númenóreans\ncontinued to serve Sauron. Two Black Númenóreans who were infamous for\nusing sorcery within Sauron's armies were the Witch-king of Angmar and\nthe Mouth of Sauron. At around the late Third Age, in the fortress of\nDol Guldur, the Necromancer (Sauron in disguise) was believed to be an\nÚlairi. He was eventually forced out by the White Council, but he\nreturned to his former kingdom of Mordor and publicly declared himself\nalive, shown as Mount Doom erupted once again. After Sauron's final\ndestruction that began the Fourth Age, a Man by the name of Herumor had\nrose to power and was rumored to have established a cult that worshipped\nthe Dark Powers in Gondor. Powers and Abilities Dark sorcery included a\nvariety of spells, potions (alchemy) and other ghastly things that\nbelonged to the Dark Arts. Dark sorcery was frequently used as a weapon,\nshown by the Witch-king's bewitched sword at the Battle of the Pelennor\nFields. Morgul-blades were noted to have been enchanted with dark\nsorcery, so that a victim would go through the Shadow World and turn\ninto a wraith if stabbed. The Fires of Orthanc were said to be sorcery\ninvented or created by Saruman. Many of the Rings of Power (the only\nknown exception being the three Elf-rings) amplified the wearers\nabilities as a sorcerer and warrior and where presumably forged with the\nhelp of Dark Magic. The fortresses of Dol Guldur and Minas Morgul were\nenchanted with sorcery, hence their translated names in Sindarin.  Known\nPractitioners Practitioners of dark sorcery were named 'Sorcerers' and\nthese included: - All the Dark Powers - Melkor - Sauron - Dark Servants\nof Sauron - Mouth of Sauron - Herumor - Saruman - Nazgûl - Witch-king of\nAngmar"

Their plan was to attack the Gondor\nprovince of Calenardhon from the across the Undeeps and that a full\nscale rebellion in Rhovanion was in preparation.

Seeing this, the Wainriders committed all they had in a great\nforce to meet them, then Calimehtar turned away which led them west into\nDagorlad further from their conquests in Rhovanion, and there a great\nbattle began. During the long struggle, Calimehtar sent cavalry over the\nUndeeps which were unguarded by the enemy due to them sending everything\nagainst Calimehtar's main host. Here, they joined up with Marhwini's\néored and attacked the enemy from the rear sealing their doom. Gondor\nwas victorious. The Wainriders scattered in disarray. Aftermath Though\nGondor won, Calimehtar did not pursue them to the death for the most\npart but Marhwini's cavalry continued to harass the survivors near\nsouthern Mirkwood, humiliating and taunting them at all at the harm they\nhad done to the innocents of Rhovanion.

The King marched his great host north from\nIthilien to the open plains just south of Mirkwood where they met their\nfoe. However, Narmacil's great host was defeated and cost Narmacil his\nlife. Aftermath After the battle was lost, the Northman noble Marhari\ninvolved in leading a rearguard action against the enemy was slain. The\nsurvivors fled south over Dagorlad and back into Ithilien and Gondor was\nforced to abandon its eastern lands. The majority of the Northmen fell\ninto slavery and those that did not withdrew further north over the\nRiver Running and into Dale, where they joined with the Men of Dale.\nOthers gathered around Marhari's son Marhwini, who settled the Vales of\nAnduin between Mirkwood and the river Anduin with fugitives slaves from\nRhovanion, who joined with them later.

History Background The reason for the sudden attacks by the\nEasterlings at this time is not known. It was possibly due to the\nancient hatred of the Men of the West going all the way back to the\nEdain, or toward the Númenóreans and the Dúnedain in general for many\ndefeats they handed them over the centuries, most recently in the Last\nAlliance. The most likely answer was probably revenge or more likely\ngreed and a desire to covet the lands of the Dúnedain. Gondor was in the\nmidst of peace so they had the element of surprise. Early stages The war\nbegan in TA 490 when the Easterlings suddenly invaded Gondor. Not fully\nprepared for war, the Easterlings were successful and no doubt ravaged,\npillaged, plundered, and caused much death in north-eastern Gondor\nparticularly North Ithilien. As King Ostoher was growing old, he charged\nhis son Tarostar with driving out the invaders. Gondor endured ten long\nyears of their attacks until TA 500 when Tarostar, afterwards called\nRómendacil I, the East-victor defeated them ending the long period\nviolence. Temporary Cessation of Hostilities Tarostar's victory defeated\nthe invaders but not utterly. The Easterlings continued to survive and\nrecoup themselves in Rhûn while Rómendacil was busy with affairs of the\nrealm. Forty-one years after their defeat, the Easterlings renewed their\nattacks on Gondor. Rómendacil once again led a host against them but was\nslain in battle that was probably lost by Gondor. Final Defeat of the\nEasterlings The Easterling's new threat didn't last long. Rómendacil's\nson Turambar immediately became King of Gondor. Eager to avenge his\nfather's death, Turambar assembled fresh armies and decisively defeated\nthe Easterlings in a battle somewhere in the north-east of Gondor in TA\n541. End of War and Conquest of Rhûn After his victory over the enemy,\nTurambar did not disband his armies and instead led them into Rhûn.\nAfter nine years of campaigning against the Easterlings, his armies\nfinally conquered a large portion of Rhûn in TA 550. The conquered\nterritory became the East-lands province of Gondor. Legacy The aftermath\nof the First Easterling War left the Easterlings defeated,\nnon-threatening, and not able to make war on Gondor for over 1,300\nyears. It also laid the groundwork for the expansion of the realm of\nGondor. The Northmen people of Rhovanion also became later allies of\nGondor.",

    "text": "The BATTLE OF THE THOUSAND CAVES was a great battle between the Dwarves\nof Nogrod and the Elves of Doriath in the Caves of Menegroth. History\nBackground After the Quest for the Silmaril and the Hunting of the Wolf,\nThingol came to possess the Silmaril that Beren cut from Morgoth's Iron\nCrown. Then around FA 500, Hurin, freshly released from his long\nimprisonment by the Dark Lord appeared and presented to the King the\nNauglamír that he took from Mîm at Nargothrond. Seeing that he now\npossessed the two most beautiful things ever created by the Children of\nIlúvatar, Thingol desired to combine them into one great creation. From\nthis, he contracted the Dwarven craftsmen working in his smithies who\nwere strongly motivated because the Nauglamir was a creation of their\nown race, and they too desired the Silmaril but hid it well. Long did\nthey labor in the deep smithies of Menegroth and when the marvelous\ncreation was complete, King Thingol came to claim it but the Dwarves\ncoveted it and withheld it from him saying he had no right to it. Seeing\ntheir true minds, Thingol scorned the Dwarves with hurtful words in\npraise of himself. Then, the Dwarves unable to bear anymore rose before\nhim and slew him then and there took the Nauglamír and the Silmaril\nwithin it and fled. The killers managed to get out of Menegroth but not\nout of the realm for word quickly spread on who was responsible and the\nDwarves were pursued to the death. Most of them were killed and the\nNauglamír and Silmaril returned to Doriath. Only two Dwarves escaped.\nMelian, unable to bear the loss of her husband and seeing that that the\ndoom she had so feared had finally come upon Doriath withdrew her\nprotection, and entrusted Mablung to send word to Beren at Tol Galen and\ngave him the Silmaril for safe-keeping. She then left Middle-earth and\nreturned to Valinor. Prelude The two surviving Dwarves that made it back\nto Nogrod and when asked what had happened they lied to their Lord\nsaying that their brethren were slain on the command of Thingol, who\nintended not to pay them for their works. Then, great anger came to the\nDwarves and the halls of Nogrod filled with their wrath, and the Dwarves\nprepared for war intending to avenge this wrong. They tried to get the\nDwarves of Belegost to help but they refused and also tried to dissuade\nthem from their intent, but they did not succeed. The Dwarves marched\nwestward through the Beleriand with a great host, and all trembled at\nthe sight of host of the Dwarves. They passed through the now open and\nunguarded borders of Doriath, and no one opposed them and retreated\nbefore them. Then, the host came to Menegroth, crossed the Bridge of\nMenegroth and entered the caves and so the battle begun. The Battle The\nbattle took place entirely underground in the many thousands of the\nCaves of Menegroth. It is not known how long the two foes fought one\nanother only that many died on both sides but the Dwarves emerged\nvictorious. Aftermath After the Dwarves won the battle, they pillaged\nand plundered all they could and then eager to get their hands on the\nNauglamir and the Silmaril, they came to the treasury of the realm and\nslew Mablung before its doors taking both the treasures. Doriath was\nsacked but the Dwarves did not claim the realm and instead left for\nhome. Doriath ceased to be without the King or his Queen. Even Beren's\navenging of the defeat at Sarn Athrad did not resurrect the kingdom, not\nuntil the coming of age of Beren's son Dior. The battle also remained in\nthe racial memories of both the Elves and Dwarves for many ages to come."

Middle years and Loss\nThe East-lands remained a part of Gondor for over 1,300 years during\nwhich the province apparently remained well-preserved even during the\ndisastrous Kin-strife. The province suffered heavily during the Great\nPlague. The traditionally hostile Easterlings could have threatened the\nprovince but was not attacked probably because the Easterlings were hit\nhard by the Plague as well. Two-hundred years later in TA 1851, the\nEasterling Wainriders invaded Gondor thru the East-lands and in TA 1856\nthe King Narmacil loss a key battle that lost Gondor the East-lands\ncompletely for over a thousand years.

The extent of the Elven\npopulation was probably sparse and hidden at this time. After Beren and\nLúthien arrival Some time around FA 469 having been granted a second but\nmortal life at the behest of Manwë under Eru, Beren and Lúthien returned\nto Middle-earth from the Halls of Mandos and settled on the isle of Tol\nGalen in the southern Ossiriand.

    "text": "The WAINRIDER WAR was a war between the Easterling Wainriders with their\nallies and Gondor with its Northmen allies. History Background In the\nmore than 600 years following Minalcar's defeat of the Easterlings in TA\n1248, the Easterling tribes of Rhûn were no longer a threat as Gondor\nruled the lands of the east all the way to the shores of the Sea of\nRhûn, and Gondor now had the loyalty of the Northmen of Rhovanion. While\nduring this long period, Gondor switched its territorial ambitions to\nthe south and built a great naval fleet that ruled the seas. However,\nthe hatred of the Dúnedain and the Men of Gondor survived in the\nremaining tribes apparently living further east but the reasons for the\nunification and attack of these hostile Easterling tribes is not known.\nThe only thing that is known is that it must have happened before TA\n1851 with no doubt great preparation and planning. Invasion Begins and\nGondor Defeated In TA 1851, the Wainriders fell upon Gondor and the\nrealm of Rhovanion causing much destruction and leaving many dead\nespecially amongst the Northmen. After five years of attacks, Gondor\nfinally assembled an army led by King Narmacil II himself. The battle\nwas lost and King Narmacil was slain in it as was his faithful Northman\nally Marhari. Afterwards, Gondor lost its eastern lands and the realm of\nRhovanion was occupied and enslaved. Rule of the Wainriders For\nforty-five long years, the Wainriders ruled in Rhovanion where they\nbuilt homes, settlements, outposts, and storehouses most likely with the\nuse of forced labor. They also no doubt had freedom of movement between\ntheir conquests in the west and Rhûn that they never had had before,\nwithout opposition from Gondor or anyone else. The Beginnings of the\nÉothéod Although most of the Northmen of the former realm of Rhovanion\nfell into slavery, some survivors of the sack and people made into\nfugitives by the Wainrider's takeover followed Marhwini, the son of the\nMarhari northwest into the Vales of Anduin where they settled. Out of\nthese people came the Éothéod, who opposed the invaders and maintained\nfriendship with Gondor. Surviving the Wainriders rule, they somehow knew\nof the Wainrider's plans and found out that they had grown hunger from\nmore conquests and that there was great hatred of the Wainriders in\nthose that they ruled. By TA 1899, they knew of their plans to attack\nthe Gondor province of Calenardhon from over the Undeeps and gave that\ninformation to the Gondor. They also planned to rouse and assist a\nrebellion in Rhovanion when such an attack begun. The Tables Turn As the\nWainriders prepare for war, the Gondor king Calimehtar sent a great host\nagainst them from out of North Ithilien. With this, the Wainrider's\nplans for Calenardhon changed and they sent all against Gondor. This\nworked in Gondor's favor as it allowed for the two foes to meet with all\nforce in one place instead of many, leaving the Undeeps undefended.\nGondor and its Éothéod allies took quick advantage of this and sent\ntheir own cavalry over the Undeeps, meant to attack the enemy from\nbehind. The two armies met in Dagorlad, and the Wainriders were defeated\nwith Marhwini's _éored_'''s ''support and with Gondor's cavalry\nassailing them from behind. The Wainrider's defeat led to an uprising in\nRhovanion by the slaves but the Wainriders were not completely expelled\nfrom the west, as they still remained in Rhovanion due to the slow\nprogress of the slave rebellion. The Éothéod also continued to harass\nthem from the northwest as well. Never-the-less, it was the beginning of\nthe end to the Wainriders hold on the west. A New Threat For forty-five\nmore years, the Easterling Wainriders were still a problem despite their\nlosses in the west and plotted a new campaign. Needing more support to\nrecoup their losses and defeat Gondor, they formed alliances with the\nMen of Harad and those of Khand. Once again, the Éothéod again warned\nGondor of this new threat to the west. In the month of Cermië of TA\n1944, war resumed with the Wainrider alliance threatening Gondor from\nboth the north and the south. Ondoher prepared to meet the enemy in the\nnorth while Eärnil, his most trusted captain of armies prepared to face\nthem in the south. The King marched his army out of Ithilien intending\nto fight the enemy once again on the Dagorland, but is driven to the\nBlack Gate by Wainriders from Rhovanion and a combined Wainrider/Khand\narmy from Rhûn traveling along the Ash Mountains to battle. There King\nOndoher was utterly defeated losing his life and his two sons: Artamir\nand Faramir. There were some survivors of the defeat that scattered\nsouth but field was lost. The Wainriders occupied Northern Ithilien was\nno opposition setting up camps. Here, the victors celebrated believing\nGondor was at last defeated but it was not true for Eärnil's smaller but\nwell led Southern Army defeated an army of Haradrim in Southern\nIthilien, and proceeded to march north to face the Wainriders. He met up\nwith some of the retreating troops of Ondoher's defeated army and fell\nupon the Wainrider's camp in a surprise attack. The Wainrider's were\ncompletely defeated in a great rout. Those Wainriders that didn't escape\nback to Rhûn died in the Dead Marshes. The war was over. Afterwards The\nWainrider threat was over and the Northmen realm in Rhovanion was\ncompletely freed and cleared of the invaders and some of these Men\nmigrated to Gondor where they were welcome as distant brethren. In TA\n1945, Eärnil was crowned King of Gondor. The Éothéod also maintained\nfriendship with Gondor. Gondor's policy switched to aiding Arnor in the\ndefeat of Angmar. Legacy The Wainrider War led to a series of events\nthat created the Éothéod who later became the Rohirrim. Their long\nfriendship with Gondor led to the later Oath of Eorl taken by their Lord\nand later King Eorl the Young after coming to the aid of another war\nagainst another Easterling threat, and the afterwards granting of\nCalenardhon to his people which afterwards became Rohan.",

Needing allies, Gondor granted them lands south\nof Greenwood the Great hoping they would stand against the Easterlings\nin support of Gondor, so there were no major open battles between Gondor\nand the Easterlings at this time.

The earlier king was the first to fully\nembrace the necessity of a strong navy, and through its use extended the\ninfluence of Gondor around the Mouths of Anduin. On March 13 3019,\nshortly before the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, some hundreds of\nfishermen went to aid Minas Tirith without a captain. Much later,\nAragorn vanquished a brief Umbarian invasion of the area. Aragorn, along\nwith Grey Company and the Army of the Dead, liberated Pelargir and the\nsurrounding Anduin estuary from the Corsairs of Umbar, after having\nprogressively pushed them out of the delta for much of that week.\nBecause the victory on 13 March was so complete, Umbar was left with no\ntools to effect its sovereignty. Thus, what might be thought of as the\n“Battle of Ethir Anduin” led directly to Umbar's reintegration with\nGondor in Aragorn's Reunited Kingdom. Description The land on the delta\nwas long settled by Men, and indeed it was a rich source of Mannish\nculture. Part of the reason for this was because it was contested\nbetween different types of Men, probably including groups like the\nNandorians and Haradrim, but definitely including Númenóreans,\nGondorians and Umbarians. Early Westron was said to have developed\nthere. The reason for the region's importance to the development of\nMannish language was likely because the lands of the delta supported Men\nof all stations in life, from lowly “lesser men” who were largely\nfishermen and other folk dependent on the sea, as well as the loftier\nNúmenóreans."

From TA 830 to TA\n1149, these kings worked hard at, and were largely successful at, adding\nterritory to Gondor with their increasingly superior naval might. The\nShip-kings pushed the boundaries of Gondor to the south and to the west,\nsuch that Gondor came to include land down to the Mouths of Anduin and\nUmbar and even south of the River Harnen. Indeed, it was under the\nShip-kings that Gondor achieved the zenith of its influence, at least\nuntil the coming of Aragorn and the Reunited Kingdom. History Falastur\nbegan the building of great fleets of ships that increased Gondor's\npower in Middle-earth down past the Mouths of Anduin. Eärnil I rebuilt\nthe ancient haven of the Faithful Pelargir and from here built a great\nfleet to conquer the enemy realm of Umbar. In TA 933, Eärnil's navy and\narmies attacked Umbar and won it from the Southrons and their Black\nNúmenórean masters. Afterwards, it became an important part of Gondor,\nserving as a great harbor and fortress of Gondor. During Hyarmendacil\nI's time, the Kingdom of Gondor reached its highest peak and the realm\nextended from the Field of Celebrant, to the borders of Mirkwood, to the\nwest of the Greyflood, just east of the Sea of Rhûn, south of the river\nHarnen, and finally to the coastal province of Umbar. The Ship-kings\nushered in a 'Golden Age' bringing Gondor great power and wealth. At\nthis time, the Men from the Vales of Anduin and those of the south\nacknowledged its authority and did homage to it. Mordor was well watched\nand the fortresses built to watch over it were well-manned and\nmaintained and it remained desolate and unpeopled. The line of\nShip-kings ended with the death Hyarmendacil I leaving behind a great\nempire that his son Atanatar II and subsequent later successors, did\nlittle to maintain."

Their language appears\nto be based on an ancient form of Common Eldarin, later enriched by\nQuenya and Sindarin, although it includes many unique 'tree-ish'\nadditions. History Old Entish Originally, the Ents had a language of\ntheir own, described as long and sonorous. Only Ents spoke Old Entish;\nnot because they kept their language a secret, as the Dwarves did with\nKhuzdul, but because no other could master it. It was quite an alien\nlanguage to all others. The Huorns and trees of Fangorn forest could\nunderstand Old Entish and converse with the Ents and each other with it.\nThe only extant sample, a-lalla-lalla-rumba-kamanda-lindor-burúme, the\nword for hill (or possibly even just part of the name of a specific\nhill), was described as a very inaccurate sampling. Even the Elves,\nmaster linguists, could not learn Old Entish, nor did they attempt to\nrecord it due to its complex sound structure. The grammar structure of\nOld Entish was also quite bizarre, often described as a lengthy,\nlong-winded discussion of a topic. There may not even have been a word\nfor yes and no: such questions would be answered by a long monologue on\nwhy the Ent in question did or did not agree with the Ent who asked the\nquestion. Ents as a rule would say nothing in Old Entish unless it was\nworth taking a long time to say. For everyday language function, they\nusually resorted to “New” Entish. New Entish Due to contact with the\nElves, the Ents learned much from them. The Ents found the Elvish\nlanguage Quenya to be a lovely language, and adapted it after their\nfashion to everyday use. However, they basically adapted Quenya\nvocabulary to Old Entish grammatical structure. Thus, unlike Old Entish,\nthe individual words of “New Entish” that characters such as Treebeard\nspoke were easily translatable. Words and Translations Most of the\nEntish words and vowels are almost entirely based on Quenya and\nSindarin, the two most common languages spoken by the Elves. de:Entisch\nru:Язык энтов"

Causes When\nNúmenor was sunk in SA 3319, the Elendili escaped and founded the Realms\nin Exile in SA 3320. In the southern kingdom of Gondor, Anárion founded\nthe city of Minas Anor and Isildur Minas Ithil, where he planted\nthe White Tree. Minas Ithil was a fortress-city strategically built in\nthe Ephel Duath to threaten Mordor. After Númenor was sunk, Sauron\nsecretly returned to Mordor and mustered a huge army of Orcs, Trolls and\nEvil Men within Mordor, desiring to once more go to war with the West\nnow that Númenor was destroyed. The Battle In SA 3429, Sauron sent a\nhuge army from Gorgoroth to besiege Minas Ithil. An army of Gondorians\nunder Isildur defended the city. In the course of the siege, Sauron's\nforces drove into the fortress and set fire to the White Tree.

Aftermath Following the capture of Minas Ithil, the\nArmy of Mordor terrorized the Eastern side of the Anduin, then a\nterritory of Gondor. The battle sparked the War of the Last Alliance,\nand led to the Western kingdoms forming an alliance to, so they hoped,\nstop Sauron once and for all.

    "text": "The son of Malvegil, King Argeleb I, reclaimed the kingship of all Arnor\nand took the prefix ar(a) (Sindarin for royal, or kingly) in token of\nthis. Cardolan did not oppose this as there the Dúnedain had grown few,\nbut the kingdom of Rhudaur resisted the claim by Argeleb, led by an evil\nhill-chief who was in secret league with Angmar. At this, Argeleb\ndecided to fortify the Weather Hills to resist an invasion from the east\nby the forces of Angmar and Rhudaur, but he was slain in battle in the\nyear TA 1356 along the frontier. Prelude In 1409 the Witch-King of\nAngmar led a great host across the river Hoarwell against land of\nCardolan, after being beaten back out of the lands of the Dúnedain many\nyears before. The son of Argeleb, King Arveleg I continued his fathers\ndefence against Angmar along the fortified Weather Hills, the Great East\nRoad, and the lower Hoarwell, and for many years he held back the\nassaults of Angmar and Rhudaur. It was also at this time that the Elven\nhaven of Rivendell was besieged by the forces of Angmar. Arnor's capital\nof Fornost lay upon the North Downs only a few dozen miles away from the\nWeather Hills, and Angmar sought a way to break through the frontier and\nlay siege to the city. It was to this end that in the year TA 1409 a\ngreat host came out of Angmar, and crossing the river it entered\nCardolan and surrounded Amon Sûl. After a fierce siege the Dúnedain of\nArnor were defeated, the tower of Amon Sûl destroyed, and King Arveleg\nslain. However, the Witch-king's victory was not complete, as the\npalantír of Amon Sûl, the greatest of the three in the north, was\ncarried back in retreat to Fornost. After the destruction of Amon Sûl,\nthe power of Arnor to resist the army of Angmar was severely weakened.\nThe tower's destruction meant that the army of Angmar had now made the\nfortified line along the Weather Hills untenable, and its forces gained\neasy access to the heart of Arnor. Rhudaur was now absorbed by Angmar\nand populated by evil men subject to the Witch-King. The few Dúnedain\nwho remained were either slain or fled far westwards, never returning to\nthe lands now claimed by Angmar. The kingdom of Cardolan was ravaged by\nthe forces of Angmar who entered its northern borders uncontested by the\ncrippled army of Arthedain, and its people fled into hiding on the\nancient Barrow Downs, or Tyrn Gorthad in Sindarin. It was in this\ndesperate defence against Angmar that the last prince of Cardolan fell\nin battle, and he was entombed by the survivors among his people in what\nsome say was the very same barrow that Frodo and his companions had been\nimprisoned during the War of the Ring. Although the situation was dire,\nthe young King Araphor, son of Arveleg, defended the city of Fornost\nagainst the host of Angmar. Although he was still a youth by the\nreckoning of his people, Araphor proved valiant, and with the help of\nCírdan of Lindon he repulsed Angmar's army from the North Downs and won\na great victory. It was at this time that Angmar was subdued by\nElven-folk from Lindon, Rivendell, and even Lothlórien for Elrond had\nbrought help over the passes of the Misty Mountains. At the same time,\nthe Stoors (one of the three peoples who were named Hobbits) who had\npreviously dwelt in the angle between the Hoarwell and the Loudwater\nfled south-westwards because of the wars and the dread of Angmar, and\nbecause the land and clime of eastern Eriador worsened and became\nunfriendly. Some of these returned to Wilderland in Rhovanion and dwelt\nalongside the banks of the Gladden, becoming a riverside people of\nfishers, but others migrated westwards to a land known by the Dúnedain\nas Sûza, which the Stoors named the Shire. These peoples were granted by\nthe eleventh king of Arthedain, Argeleb II, land that had become\nsparsely populated by war, and dwelling there as a people became the\nHobbits known by the end of the Third Age for their love of peace and\ndomesticity. Aftermath Amon Sûl was the main defensive outpost in the\nWeather Hills and northern Cardolan. With it gone the Witch-King was\nable to take and ravage Cardolan, as well as consolidate his new\nconquests in Rhudaur, which his Hill-Men allies and subjects had taken,\nas well as launch attacks against the whole of Arthedain. However\ndespite permanently ending the threat that was Cardolan, Angmar was\nunable to ride its momentum, and was driven away from the city of\nFornost and the North Downs by the forces of the new King Araphor and\nLord Círdan of Lindon."

    "text": "The CORSAIR WARS were a long, predominately naval struggle between Kings\nand Stewards of Gondor and a series of renegade rebel forces based at\nUmbar and Pelargir. Historical Background The fortress haven of Umbar\nwas founded by Númenórean colonists during the Second Age, during the\npeak of Númenorean power. When Ar-Pharazôn the Golden landed in Middle\nEarth to challenge the power of Sauron, he landed at this heavily\nfortified port city. After the Downfall of Númenor, these colonists\ncontinued to be influenced by Sauron, and showed great antipathy to the\nexile Kingdoms founded by the Faithful of Númenor, Arnor and Gondor.\nThey became known forever afterward as the Black Númenoreans, battling\nGondor by land and sea. It is likely that Umbar was conquered for Gondor\nunder one of the Ship-Kings, possibly by Tarannon Falastur. During the\nreign of Earnil I and his son, Ciryandil, the Haradrim constantly laid\nsiege to Umbar and in T.A. 1015, Ciryandil himself was slain defending\nit. This caused his son to conquer Harad and eventually take the name,\nHyarmendacil I. Early Years In the aftermath of the Kin-strife, the\ngreat civil conflict between Eldacar and the usurper Castamir,\nCastamir's sons fled to to Umbar. There they established a breakaway\ngovernment in opposition to Gondor, and continued to clash with Gondor\nfor centuries to come. Pelargir Battles In T.A. 1551, Hyarmendacil II\nconquered Harad when his father, Aldamir, was slain in a skirmish with\nthe Corsairs. However, Umbar held out against Hyarmendacil's attacks,\nbut suffered grievously. In T.A. 1634 the Corsairs learnt that King\nMinardil, son of Hyarmendacil, was holidaying in the port city of\nPelargir. Later the Corsairs staged a surprise attack, and Minardil was\nslain before he could organise a proper defence of the port. The\nCorsairs then made a sudden withdrawal. Unfortunately for Gondor,\nPelagir remained a prime target for the Corsairs throughout the rest of\nthe Third Age, and by the time of the War of the Ring, the city was a\nshadow of its former glory. The Siege of Umbar This may refer to several\ndifferent events in history, when Umbar constantly changed hands between\nGondor, and the Corsairs with their Haradrim allies. The first time\nUmbar was involved with the wars between Gondor and Harad was when one\nof the Ship-Kings conquered it from the Haradrim and Black Numenoreans\nwho resided there. At this point, Harondor was still under Gondorian\ncontrol so it can be assumed that perhaps Umbar was connected by land to\nGondor, and not just a port outpost surrounded by enemies. The wars with\nHarad never ceased and in T.A. 1015 the Haradrim staged an assault on\nUmbar and King Ciryandil was slain defendings its walls. Although the\nport was not taken, it effected the Gondorian populace and above all\nelse, Ciryaher, Ciryandil's son. 35 years later, King Ciryaher not only\nlifted the Siege of Umbar, but conquered a huge portion of Near Harad,\ncrushing the power of the Haradrim. For the next four hundred years,\nUmbar was to remain in Gondorian control until after the Kin Strife,\nwhen the Sons of Castimir fled Pelagir and seized Umbar for their own.\nThis proved to be the start of Gondor's rapid decline. Aldamir, son of\nEldacar, still holding a grudge against Castimir and his sons for the\nmurder of his brother in the burning of Osgiliath, assaulted Umbar and\nwas slain in the process, but the Corsairs victory was soon avenged when\nVinyarion, Aldamir's son, conquered Harad and laid siege to Umbar. But\nGondor's temporary territorial claims in the south were soon reversed\nwhen the Gondorian siege of Umbar was lifted and the Corsairs raided\nPelagir, killing King Minardil in the process. Following the destruction\nof the Plague, both sides were temporarily weakened, but Telumehtar of\nGondor struck first and conquered Umbar for Gondor, the last descendants\nof Castimir perished in the process. It is never stated when the\nCorsairs reconquered Umbar, but it is likely that it fell back to the\nCorsairs sometime during the reigns of the next few Kings, when Gondor\nitself was nearly toppled by Wainriders."

The idea of giant turtles\nultimately derives from Eastern myths, and in the European versions the\nmonster is often confused with whales. Canon It is never explained\nwhether the turtle-fish was an actual race or just a fictional character\nfor the poem “Fastitocalon”. In an earlier version of the Legendarium,\nUlmo, Lord of the Waters, uses his giant whale, Uin, to drag Tol Eressëa\ntowards Aman. This whale reappears in J.R.R. Tolkien's story\n_Roverandom_.

Aftermath\nThe reconquest of Minas Ithil helped to prevent a Mordor assault from\nbeing launched across the Anduin unopposed, and allowed the Last\nAlliance to concentrate on a single front of war, far to the north.\nAnárion rebuilt Minas Ithil, but in the Third Age it fell into\nnear-abandonment by Gondor, only to be retaken by the Ringwraiths in TA\n2002."

History\nPrelude After the death of King Dáin I outside his halls at the\nconclusion of the War of the Dwarves and Dragons, the new King, Thrór,\nand his brother Grór abandoned the Grey Mountains for safer dwellings\nwith most of their subjects. The king went to the Lonely Mountain\n(former seat of the Durin's throne), and Grór to the primary source of\nthe Longbeards' iron supply, the Iron Hills. Over the years, the Dwarves\nof Erebor gained great renown throughout Middle-earth for the splendor\nof their halls, craftsmanship, and great stores of wealth. Word\neventually reached Smaug the dragon, one of the great fire drakes who\nnow dwelled in the Grey Mountains, who in his lust for treasure desired\nto take the mountain. The Great Firestorm One night in TA 2770, Smaug\ndescended upon the mountain in flames, catching the Dwarves and Men of\nDale off guard. The warriors of the mountain came out of the great gate\nto engage the dragon, but all were killed. Then Smaug attacked Dale\nwhose warriors were all called to arms, and destroyed most of them. He\nthen returned to the mountain and routed the remaining Dwarves.\nAfterwards he piled up all the gold within the mountain and made it his\ndwelling, emerging only ever so often to eat maidens from Dale which\neventually caused its abandonment. Aftermath In the end, Erebor was\ntaken by Smaug and likely thousands of Dwarves and hundreds of Men in\nthe great city of Dale (including Lord Girion) were killed during the\nterrible firestorm that Smaug committed. King Thrór himself along with\nhis son Thráin II barely escaped out of the secret entrance. Most of the\nDwarves who escaped fled to the Iron Hills. With his family and a small\ncompany of followers, the King went into a homeless wandering southward\nbut not before cursing Smaug. It would be over two hundred years before\nThrór's grandson Thorin II Oakenshield would return to the mountain to\nreclaim his home and treasure. Bard the Bowman, a descendant of Girion,\nwould avenge Girion in slaying Smaug when the dragon attacked Lake-town\nin TA 2941.

    "text": "The WAR OF THE DWARVES AND DRAGONS was a conflict that took place from\nTA 2570 to 2589. Background The defeat of Morgoth in the War of Wrath\nleft the Dragons few and weak, hiding mostly in the Forodwaith of\nMiddle-earth. But over the millennia the Dragons multiplied and became\nstrong once again. Even centuries before the beginning of the war, the\nDragon Scatha had stolen treasure from the Dwarves and kept it in his\nhoard; unfortunately, Scatha was slain by Fram of the Éothéod, who kept\nthe treasure for himself. History In TA 2570, the Dragons made war on\nthe Dwarves of the Grey Mountains, sacking and plundering their halls\nand mines. The war lasted for almost twenty years, but in TA 2589 the\nDragons attacked the halls of King Dáin I, and outside city a great\nCold-drake killed the king and his second son Frór. After this defeat,\nmost of Durin's folk abandoned the Grey Mountains. King Thrór and some\nof his followers went back to the former Dwarven dwelling of the Lonely\nMountain, while his younger brother Grór led others to the Iron Hills.\nAftermath The Dwarves of the Iron Hills, as well as the Dwarves of the\nLonely Mountain, managed to prosper for the following couple of\ncenturies. However the threat of Dragons would revisit their history: in\nTA 2770, Smaug flew south from the North “like a hurricane” and attacked\nthe wealthy Dwarven Kingdom."

    "text": "UIN was a great whale that served Ulmo, being entitled as the PRIMEVAL\nWHALE. Etymology Originally, the Gnomish term _uin_ (“wave”, and later\n“whale”). Another Gnomish for whale is _uimoth_ (“sheep or shepherd of\nwaves”). _Moth_ stands for “sheep” or “1,000”, indicating its original\nmeaning of “flock” (e.g. _mothweg_ means “shepherd”). Etymology of Uin\ngreatly resembles Uinen, and her spouse had a cross with the whale for\npulling the island. Other names Uin was also called GULMA'S GREAT WHALE,\nwith Gulma being an earlier name for Ulmo. Descriptions The whale's\nphysical features are rather unclear although according to the\n_Roverandom_, Uin was the oldest of the Right Whales (_Eubalaena sp._).\nUin was the oldest and mightiest of all whales, and could have been one\nof the most momentous of all creatures of Ulmo, as the whale was to pull\nUlmo's cart. In the early version of the legendarium, the whale was also\nleft to carry the island of Tol Eressëa across the Sea of Belegaer to\noff the coast of Bay of Eldamar near Valinor, the Aman's capital. Uin\nwas also in charge to carry important figures. It was unknown whether\nUin was actually one of Ainur to have own shapes like the Great Eagles.\nSome speculate that Uin could have been one of ancient beings present on\nArda in likeness with Tom Bombadil.",

    "text": "The MORIA ORCS OF DOL GULDUR were a vile group of orcs that briefly\nsettled in the ancient fortress of Dol Guldur in approximately TA 2941.\nNone of them were originally from the abandoned fortress, but instead\ncame from Moria. History When Azog the Defiler paid homage to the\nNecromancer of Dol Guldur (Sauron), a pact was made in which Azog would\nbring the armies of the Misty Mountains forth to conquer the North of\nMiddle-earth and to revive the ancient kingdom of Angmar. During the\nquest to reclaim Erebor from the Dragon Smaug, many of the Orcs of Moria\nmet at the sorcery hill within the center of the stronghold and began to\nforge weapons and armor to prepare for war in the east region of\nRhovanion. After Gandalf was imprisoned by Sauron, the assembled force\nof orcs set off towards the region of Erebor, to wage war on the\nunsuspecting Dwarves, Elves, and Men, currently there. Like any other\nfoul breed of orc, the orcs of the Moria brought along terrible\ncreatures of war with them. Huge and monstrous war trolls, as well as\nflesh starved wargs joined the massive orc host. During the Battle of\nFive Armies, Azog's host of 30,000 Guldur Orcs clashed with the allied\nforces in the valley of Erebor, and within the streets of the ruined\ncity of Dale. During the day long fight, countless thousands were\nslaughtered at the hands of these orcs, the battle only being won when\nThorin Oakenshield killed Azog at the precipice of Ravenhill, thus\ncutting off the commanding head of the orc army. The allied forces were\nalso aided by dozens of the mighty Great Eagles, which were already\ndoing considerable damage to Bolg's Gundabad army. The orc army was thus\ndefeated, and lost a considerable amount of their forces: only a few\nhundred to about a thousand managed to escape the battle. Description\nThese huge creatures were brutal, vicious, bloodthirsty and “bred for\nwar”. The Guldur Orcs were heavier-built and larger than the original\nMoria Orcs that came to the abandoned fortress. They were a hulking and\nmuscular breed of orc that would not be matched in terms of size and\nstrength until the creation of Saruman's Uruk-hai. Most were hive-minded\n“mindless brutes” that worked directly under the orders of the one\ncurrently in charge of their forces/kind. When their leader was killed,\nthey would completely lose all methods of strategy/control and become\ntruly mindless. The loss of their command/sense of purpose/control was\ntheir one major flaw, as a fighter/soldier, their primary motive was\nkilling and war, all other things (self preservation, security,\nteamwork) did not truly apply to them. They can be equated to \"A school\nof swarming piranhas”. This type of Moria Orcs look to be much larger\nthan the smaller, more dwarf sized orcs of Moria, and instead of having\ngreyish or greenish skin have a much more earth-like skin colour.\nTranslations French Orques de Guldur -------- ------------------",

    "text": "The DUEL IN DOL GULDUR is a battle that took place in Dol Guldur between\nSauron and Gandalf. After investigating the tombs of the Nazgûl in the\nHigh Fells of Rhudaur, Gandalf entered the old fortress of Dol Guldur\nand bring forth the evil. That was when he was ambushed by strange\nfigure who was revealed to be Thrain, son of Thrór and father of Thorin\nOakenshield. Gandalf saved him bu removing the insanity and planned to\nget him out of the fortress. However, their efforts came to late when\nthey were ambushed by Azog and group of Guldur Orcs that prevented them\nfrom escaping. Gandalf and Thrain managed to elude them, but they both\nencountered the Sauron, who killed Thrain and managed to beat Gandalf.\nAfter subduing the wizard, Sauron revealed himself, much to Gandalf's\nhorror. Biography Prelude In TA 2941, Gandalf was forced to abandon\nCompany of Thorin Oakenshield near the borders of Mirkwood and travel to\nthe High Fells of Rhudaur, the eastern part of Arnor. After leaving the\nCompany, Gandalf reaches the High Fells, revealed to be a chamber built\nprecariously into the side the a mountain and barred by an iron gate,\nwhich has been ripped open violently. As Gandalf steps inside, he slips\nand begins sliding down a slanted chute leading to a bottomless chasm,\nnearly falling to his death but managing to land on a narrow staircase\nbuilt into the wall at the base of the chute just in time. It is\nimmediately revealed that High Fells was neither meant to be found nor\nleft once entered, but Gandalf continues his descent down into the\ndarkness nonetheless. He managed to reach one of the a chamber built\ninto the wall whose iron gate has also been crudely smashed, where it is\nrevealed to hold a tomb whose massive stone lid broken has been broken\nin two from the inside and now lies empty. While trying to solve this\nalone, Gandalf was startled by the sudden appearance of Radagast, who\nquestions why they have chosen to meet in the High Fells. There, Gandalf\nwent on to reveal much of the tombs and that the chamber had been\ndesigned to hold a being whose name has long been forgotten, and would\nbe known only as a “servant of evil.” Gandalf then shines his staff down\nthe chasm to reveal the presence of eight similar chambers, all\nsimilarly broken out of by their captors, indicating that the chamber is\nthe prison of the Nazgûl, the nine servants of the Dark Lord Sauron. As\nthey left the Fells, Gandalf and Radagast discuss the Nazgûl's\nreawakening, and Gandalf asserts that they have been summoned to Don\nGoldur by the Necromancer. When Radagast asserts that no human sorcerer\ncould possess such powerful dark magic, Gandalf relays his growing\nsuspicion that the Necromancer is actually Sauron in disguise, but was\nstill too weak to assume his true form, as the Nazgûl only answer to\ntheir one true master. When Gandalf decided to return to the dwarven\ncompany and meet them at the slopes of Erebor, Radagast insists that\nthey must investigate Dol Guldur at once. Gandalf counters that the\ndwarves are in great danger without him, but Radagast reminds him that\nif Sauron has indeed returned, the entire world would soon be in great\ndanger. Encounter with Thrain Reluctantly convinced by Radagast's words,\nthe two wizards arrive near the entrance of Dol Guldur. Radagast seems\nuncertain that the fortress is occupied, but Gandalf immediately\nrecognises that a spell of concealment lies on the Hill of Sorcery.\nBefore entering the fortress himself, Gandalf ordered Radagast to warn\nGaladriel of their discovery. Radagast warned him that it could be a\ntrap, but Gandalf denied and enters the fortress at once. Upon entering,\nGandalf began to chant spells in Quenya to bring forth all hidden evil\nand remove the shroud of concealment. While Azog and his army remained\nhidden, Gandalf continued to investigate deep in the abandoned fortress,\nbut that was not until he encountered a strange diminished figure who\nhad been following the wizard. The figure was known to be an insane\ndwarf and jumped down onto Gandalf and attacked him under his madness.\nThe two engage in battle until the wizard managed to to restrain him and\nused his power to bring back his senses. After Gandalf healed the dwarf\nfrom his madness that infected him, he was so surprised and relieved\nthat the dwarf was revealed to be Thráin, son of Thrór. Thráin began to\nremember what had happened to him and realized that he was in Dol Guldur\nfor a long time. Before leaving the old fortress, Thráin wanted to know\nif the map and key (that he gave to Gandalf) were kept safe, but when\nthe wizard told him that he gave the items to Thorin who was embarked on\nthe Quest of Erebor, Thráin was shocked by this and told Gandalf that\nhis son, nor anyone, must never enter the mountain due to the sickness\nthat lied upon the treasure. Gandalf also discovers that the last of the\nSeven Dwarf Rings is missing, and Thrain remembers how he lost it to\nAzog when he brutally cut off his ring finger. Duel in the Fortress At\naround nightfall, Thráin helped Gandalf navigate through the fortress\nand continued to explain to him that Smaug and The One were in league\nwith each other until Azog himself launched a surprise attack and was\nable to stun Gandalf and scatter his staff and sword. Gandalf however\nwas able to reclaim his staff and easily repelled Azog with a\ntelekinetic force, enraging the pale orc. Gandalf keeps Azog and his\norcs at bay with his staff and demands to know where Sauron is, to which\nAzog replies “he is everywhere”. Gravely outnumbered, Gandalf used a\nflash spell for him and Thráin to flee from the orcs; he either\nteleported or simply ran away afterwards. Gandalf and Thráin make their\nescape, but are soon pursued by a group of Warg-riders. Gandalf uses his\nstaff to strike a wall; the resulting blast crumbles an entire tower\nthat crashes down on the Warg Riders and breaks the bridge. As they soon\nreached the entrance, Gandalf and Thráin found a cloud of darkness\nbarring their way out. It was the Necromancer, who warned “there is no\nlight which can defeat the darkness”. Seeing no way out, Thráin told\nGandalf to tell Thorin that he loved him, to which Gandalf replied he\ncould tell Thorin himself once they got out of there. Despite Gandalf's\nattempts to protect him, Thráin was sucked into the black mist and\nconsumed by the Necromancer. After Thráin's death, Gandalf and the\nNecromancer engage in a battle of light and dark as the Necromancer\nlaunches a barrage of shadow energy at Gandalf, who repels it with a\nforce field of light powered by his staff which makes his crystal grow\nwith great light in a small radius. The Necromancer repeatedly launches\nhimself at Gandalf's massive spherical light shield, while Gandalf\nstruggles to maintain it. Sauron forces the shield to dissipate, but\nGandalf conjures it again to hold off the dark energy. When Gandalf\nmanages to push the energy further away from him, it stacks up and\nbreaks through the shield a second time. Exhausted, Gandalf holds up his\nstaff as a physical shield against his foe. The Necromancer then\napproaches him in a flaming spectral form, and the flames disintegrate\nGandalf's staff. The smoke and flames telekinetically pin him against a\nwall, most of which collapses from the surging energy. At this point the\nNecromancer can be seen as a figure with a horned helmet, in an aura of\nfire resembling a great eye. Gandalf's worst suspicions are confirmed as\nthe Necromancer reveals himself to indeed be Sauron. Gandalf is later\nimprisoned in a cage and watches in horror as Azog's army of Guldur Orcs\nmarch towards the Lonely Mountain."

History Prelude In TA 2941, Thorin II Oakenshield led his\ncompany of dwarves across the path of Mirkwood in order to reach the\nLonely Mountain and reclaim their homeland from the dragon Smaug, who\ntook over the mountain for many years. However, the company started to\nsuccumb to the sickness, which infected the entire forest, and would\neventually be captured by a group of Giant Spiders that spawned from the\nold fortress of Dol Guldur, the place where the Dark Lord Sauron\n(nicknamed the NECROMANCER) lingered and was preparing to send forth his\nlegions to attack the mountain. Bilbo Baggins, the company's burglar,\nwas the first to escape after slaying a spider and used the magical ring\n(that he found in Gollum's cave) to make him invisible and free his\ncompanions. After freeing the dwarves, Bilbo attempted to unite with\nthem until he got himself separated when dozens of spiders were crawling\ntowards the company. While the dwarves were trying to make their escape,\nLegolas, son of Thranduil, and group of Silvan Elves of Mirkwood\nsurrounded them and prevented their escape. The dwarves were brought to\nKing Thranduil, who ordered his guards to lock the dwarves in the\ndungeon while he attempts to make a deal with Thorin. Thorin refused to\naccept Thranduil's deal since he never forgot the time when the Elven\nKing turned his back on him and his people after the dragon took over\nErebor.  The Escape In the morning, Bilbo Baggins managed to free his\ncompanions when he still used the magical ring to keep himself invisible\nand stole the keys from the wine cellars. Together, they manage to\nescape through the halls of Thrandruil through barrels thrown into the\nriver. Unfortunately, the Elves discover this trick and managed to\nprevent them from escaping. Before the elves attempted to arrest the\ndwarves, Bolg led a large group of 200 Orcs to attack the company and\nthe elves. The dwarves were weaponless, but they managed to fight off\nthe orcs and steal a couple of their weapons while Kili attempted to\nopen the gate. Before Kili reached the lever, Bolg shot a Morgul arrow\nstraight into the dwarf's leg, preventing him from opening the gate of\nthe river. That was when Tauriel arrived and managed to save Kili by\nshooting several orcs while Legolas and the rest of the elves arrive to\nengage the orcs. As the fighting progressed, Kili managed to open the\ngate and escape with the dwarves across the long river run. Bolg leads\nthe orcs after the dwarves, but Legolas, Tauriel, and the Elves give\npursuit and fight them in order to recapture Thorin and Company. After\nthe dwarves managed to escape and make their way to the Long Lake,\nTauriel saves Legolas from Narzug, who was close to killing the prince.\nBefore she could kill Narzug, Legolas told her that they would keep him\nalive and interrogate him. Aftermath Inside the Halls of the Woodland\nRealm, Legolas, Tauriel, and Thranduil interrogate Narzug, who refuses\nto talk. When the Elven King promised the orc that he would set him\nfree, Narzug reveals “His Master” serves the “One” and that the world\n“will burn in the flames of war”. After getting all the information,\nThranduil beheaded Narzug with his sword.",

History Background Later\nin TA 2941, Bilbo Baggins of the Shire accompanied a company of Dwarves\nled by Thorin II Oakenshield to recapture the whole Kingdom of Erebor\nfrom the Dragon Smaug. The party reached the mountain later that year on\nDurin's Day and sent Bilbo in through the secret door to carry out his\nduty as their burglar. Bilbo had already done some exploration of the\nold hallways using the Back Door and had stolen a golden cup from the\ntreasure. By this deed and by Bilbo's bold speech Smaug's anger was\nkindled. Erroneously believing, due to some remarks Bilbo had made\nduring his conversation with Smaug, that some scheme of the people of\nEsgaroth was the reason for the Dwarves' (and Bilbo's) presence, Smaug\nflew to Esgaroth to show them who is “the true King under the Mountain”.\nFire and Water Smaug appeared first in the north, his light turning the\nLake golden. At first, the Lake-men thought it was gold flowing down the\nriver, but a grim-voiced man named Bard realized that it was the Dragon,\nawake and roused to wrath. At his warning, the bells were rung, and the\ntown prepared for battle, by cutting off the bridge, covering the roofs\nwith water, and filling every vessel with water. When Smaug arrived, he\ntried to land on the bridge only to find it destroyed, and instead flew\nover the town, spouting flames and smashing buildings with his tail. The\nArchers of Lake-town fired at him, but only managed to enrage him\nfurther. As he set the town aflame, the Lake-men tried to douse the\nflames, but to no avail, as he methodically destroyed the town. The\ntownspeople abandoned and escaped into the water, and the Master fled in\nhis Golden boat. Only the company of archers led by Bard (a descendant\nof Girion, Lord of Dale) stood their ground, and in the end, even they\nfled. As Bard bent his bow with his last arrow, a thrush arrived, and to\nhis amazement, found he could understand it, as he was of the race of\nDale. It told him about the dragon's weak spot. Bard fired the Black\nArrow, an heirloom of Dale, and with his last shot killed the dragon.\nWith a final scream, Smaug flew up into the air, turned over and fell\nonto the town, destroying it. Aftermath After the Dragon's death, the\npeople turned on the cowardly master of Lake-town, and Bard became their\nleader, while still acknowledging the master as the elected Ruler. The\ndeath of Smaug had massive consequences, creating struggle for the\ntreasure of Erebor, and leading to the Battle of the Five Armies.",

    "text": "The WAR BETWEEN ROHAN AND DUNLAND was a war fought between Rohan and the\nDunlendings in the late Third Age. History Background Ever since the\nformer Gondor province of Calenardhon was awarded to the Rohirrim by\nCirion for the faithful loyalties of their founder Eorl the Young\ninstead of them, the Dunlendings remained forever hostile. For in the\nbuilding of their kingdom, the Rohirrim forced these uncivil and\nbarbaric Men out of their settlements in the northern valleys at the\nfoot of the White Mountains and the plains of what would become western\nRohan. They frequently raided Rohan and were always a source of trouble\nto it. However, the Rohirrim and Dunlendings still had to live side by\nside with one another and apparently intermingled and intermarried and\nhad peace for a time. In the twenty-eighth century of the Third Age, a\nman known as Freca, said to have both Rohirrim and Dunlendish blood rose\nin power and wealth and lorded over the Dunlendings on both sides of the\ndisputed Adorn river. He peacefully cooperated with the Kings of Rohan\nand was supposed to obey the king's summons and attend his councils;\nhowever, in later years when he sought the throne of Rohan, he grew\narrogant and only came when he felt like it. Prelude In TA 2754, Freca,\ndrunken with pride and ambition he boldly rode into the King's house\nwith a force of men for a meeting. Freca began making demands to King\nHelm that his son Wulf should be wedded to Helm's daughter which would\nno doubt give he and his family power. Helm refused and insulted him\nbefore his men. Humiliated, Freca flew into an angry rage nearly\nstarting a fight in the hall. Helm finally met him face to face outside\nof Edoras in a field and after insulting him further struck him down\nwith one blow from his fist, and he died soon afterwards. Still furious,\nHelm proclaimed all of Freca's successors the enemy of Rohan. War and\nSiege Four years later in TA 2758, the Dunlending led by Wulf came for\ntheir revenge at a time when Gondor could not help them. Rohan was\ninvaded from the east and from Isengard assembling in great force at\nmouths of the rivers Lefnui and Isen. The armies of Rohan were defeated.\nEdoras was conquered and Wulf sat in the Meduseld calling himself King\nof Rohan. The Dunlendings were cruel, taking slaves and forcing the\nsurviving Rohirrim to flee to the dales in White Mountains and Helm fled\nto the Hornburg taking great losses but the worse was yet to come. A\nlong and terrible winter fell upon all of Middle-earth affecting both\nsides. Helm and his loyal remnant of Rohirrim endured a long siege\nthroughout the long winter bringing terror to the enemy, but in time he,\nhis sons, and followers perished in the cold or in battle. When the Long\nWinter was over Fréaláf Hildeson, Helm's nephew came down from Dunharrow\nwith a small force and regained the Meduseld and retook Edoras. Wulf was\nslain and soon all the remaining enemy forces were driven out with the\nhelp of Gondor whose forces were now able to help their ally. Afterwards\nFréaláf Hildeson now became King of a second line of Kings in Rohan.\nSaruman also came to Rohan proclaiming friendship, wooing the new king\nwith gifts, and praising their victory over their enemies and for many\nyears appeared on the outside to be Rohan's friend, living peacefully in\nIsengard. Helm's body was brought down from the Hornburg and buried in\nthe ninth mound of the Kings of Rohan. Rohan was weakened for many years\nto come but so were its enemies and so no further threat of invasion\ncame again. Years after, King Folcwine restored the realm to its former\nstrength. Legacy The defeat of Dunlendings in the war left behind bitter\nmemories in the Dunlendings who continued to hate Rohan and its rulers.\nThey still coveted the land of Rohan that they failed to capture for\nthemselves. So hundreds of years later when the fallen Wizard Saruman\nbecame powerful and hostile to Rohan, they joined with him and his\nallies to harass Rohan during the War of the Ring.",

They are a type of Olog-hai originating from somewhere in the\nMisty Mountains, likely Moria or Mount Gram that have settled in the old\nfortress of Dol Guldur. They are slightly different to the Guldur War\nTrolls and the Great Guldur War Trolls in terms of appearance and\nstature. History These more cunning relative of Trolls were used\nprimarily in Azog the Defiler's Dol-Guldur army, directed to come out as\nsoon as Azog called for the War Beasts, almost immediately these Ologs\nsmashed into the Elven and Dwarven armies, causing massive damage. When\nsome of the Orc regiments made their way to the ruins of Dale, some of\nthese trolls joined them, climbing over the walls or simply smashing\nthem down to gain access. One of these trolls was even given a stone\nheadpiece to act as a battering ram to the walls of Dale. The smaller\ntrolls with clubs rallied against Dain's forces but are stopped by\nThorin and company’s arrival from the gates of Erebor and they are all\ndestroyed by the rallied dwarves. Some of these trolls survived until\nthe end of the battle, still fighting on when the Bats of Gundabad\narrived. But once the Eagles arrived, the remaining trolls either fled\ninto the Were-Worm tunnels, or were eventually taken down by the\ncombined allied forces. Heavily armored in thick plates of steel, these\ntrolls were more than a match for the allied armies during the Battle of\nthe Five Armies. They were about 9-12 feet tall at most, being the\nsmaller trolls on the battlefield. Their only weapons were wooden clubs\nfitted with iron spikes, of which was to be used on the Iron Hill\nDwarves, and Mirkwood Elves. Statistics These trolls were of various\nsizes and more importantly, were armoured like the Guldur Orcs. They\nwere either about the size of a regular troll in the films or that of an\nOgre. These trolls were fearsome weapons on the field and devastated\ndozens of soldiers with one strike alone of their weapons. These trolls\nwere quite intelligent and kept formation with the orcs as they marched\nto battle, in battle these trolls carried bladed axe/sword like weapons\nupon their arms, (similar to the Guldur Orcs' shields) long metal maces\nwhich could smash the very earth several feet into the air, taking down\nseveral men at once. Some even used their bare hands, balling them up\ninto fists to smash the allied armies, or sweeping them up and throwing\nthem like rag-dolls. Others used spiky clubs. Usage These trolls so far\nhave only seen action in the Peter Jackson's film adaptation of the\nBattle of the Five Armies, and seen during the later portion of the\nbattle, preparing to charge at a surrounded portion of Dain's army at\nthe gate of Erebor. Six of these trolls were put to the front lines to\nattack, when Thorin Oakenshield rallied the dwarves and regained their\nmorale, four of these trolls were killed by heavy spears, being lodged\ndirectly into their necks, killing them. (However it is also possible\nthese trolls have been fighting previously and were wounded by attacks\nfrom before) The remaining trolls held their ground and smashed into the\nDwarven lines. Later on these trolls were reinforced by the much larger\ntrolls, and Bats of Gundabad.",

History Background The siege began in TA 2758 after the\nDunlendings defeated the armies of Rohan, overran their country and\nconquered Edoras. The populace fled to the dales in White Mountains to\nescape death or slavery. Their they took refuge while King Helm and a\nmodest group of loyal followers not willing surrender or flee, fled to\nthe Hornburg, a fortress in the White Mountains. There began a deadly\nsiege. Under Siege Within the fortification, Helm endured the enemy but\nthe worst was yet to come. The Long Winter that began in November, 2758\nbrought heavy snows and freezing colds. The terrible weather brought\nhardship to both sides and there was great hunger to near starvation\nduring the Yule. The hardship and suffering led Háma, the son of Helm to\nattack the enemy and look for food without the approval of the king. He\nand his company were lost in the snow. What followed afterward is\nunclear and possibly part legend but apparently the resistance\ncontinued. For it was said that Helm himself grew terrible and fierce\nduring the hardships of the siege. It was said that he continued\ndefending the Hornburg, apparently on just his own dreadful personality\nwith great losses. It was also said or implied that he alone was left to\ndefend the Hornburg, and that he would often go out alone in a mad\nfrenzy apparently without any weapons slaying his enemies with only his\nbare hands, and seemed nearly unstoppable. Because of this apparent\ndread, all enemies retreated from the Deeping Coomb. Despite all this,\nthe defenders still perished including Helm. Afterwards One day near the\nend of the winter, the Dunlendings heard his horn but neither he or any\nof his men appeared. When the sun broke the sky, Helm was found on the\ndike frozen to death. It is not known if the Dunlendings entered the\nHornburg as victors but they probably did not due to the fear of the\nghostly terror of Helm's spirit, that had spread amongst them. Legacy\nHelm's finial stand in the Hornburg led Rohan's enemies to fear ever\nafter the sound of his name and his horn. This fear was used again\nagainst Rohan's enemies during the War of the Ring when Saruman's Army\nbesieged the Hornburg during the Battle of the Hornburg, when the horn\nwas sounded as a sign of Théoden desire to continue resisting the\ninvaders despite the odds.",

    "text": "SIEGE OF DALE is a battle which took place at the ruins of Dale in TA\n2941. History Beginning of the battle outside Erebor and Dale Before the\nOrc army arrived, there was an initial skirmish between Thranduil's army\nand Dain's forces. After exchanging insults with Thranduil, Gandalf, and\nBard, Dáin ordered his ram-riders to charge the Elves. Thranduil ordered\nhis archers to fire a volley of arrows at the Dwarves mounted on goats.\nBut the Dwarves countered with spinning ballista shots that shredded the\nhail of arrows and crashed into the Elven ranks. However, once the\nDwarves got close enough to Thranduil's army, many of them were shot\ndown or speared by the Elves. Some Elves were knocked down by the goats,\nbut others held firm against the Dwarves despite their casualties. The\nElven ranks simply reformed and funneled the Dwarves in. Dáin and his\ninfantry soon clashed into the ranks of the elves, resulting in the\nmassacre of dozens of elves and dwarves. Before both sides suffer\nheavier casualties, they are interrupted by the were-worms bursting out\nof the ground and leaving behind five gaping holes in the ground. Upon\nthe arrival of Azog's massive orc forces, Dáin Ironfoot rallies his\ntroops and leads his surviving forces of Dwarven warriors (consisting of\nmore than 40 Dwarven goat-riders, 5 war chariots carrying more than 20\nwarriors, and 800 Dwarven infantry) to battle against the Orc armies.\nThe dwarves set up a shieldwall and stand their ground as the orcs\ncharge toward them in a massive wave. Before the orcs collide with the\ndwarves, Thranduil dispatches several hundred of his elf-warriors to\nlaunch a surprise frontal attack. The distraction is enough for the\ndwarves to break their shieldwall and charge into the ranks of the orcs\nwith lowered spears. Dain on his armored war hog and Thranduil on his\ngiant stag fight in the front ranks, slaying dozens of orc warriors in\nthe process. Seeing the first wave of his troops being cut to pieces by\nthe elves and dwarves, Azog signals his war beasts to attack. Dozens of\narmored mountain trolls and Ogres pour out of the tunnels and advance\nupon the dwarves and elves. Thranduil rallies his archers who fire a\nbarrage of arrows at the war beasts, killing three Guldur Olog-Hai\ntrolls and hundreds of orcs in the process. Dáin and Thranduil then\nthrow the rest of their troops into the fray and launch a fresh attack,\ninflicting heavy casualties on the forces of Azog the Defiler. Azog\nnotices two of the dwarven war chariots slaughtering dozens of his\nwarriors and orders his war beasts to destroy the chariots. A group of\nten ogres charge the war chariots and managed to destroy them in the\nprocess, crushing the goats pulling the chariots and striking down the\ndwarves with their clubs. Breaching the Walls of Dale Knowing that the\ndwarves, men, and elves could not fight on two battlefronts, Azog seizes\nthe opportunity and orders a full-scale attack on the city of Dale. A\nforce consisting of nearly 10,000 Guldur Orcs, four armored trolls, and\nfifteen Ogres began their advance towards the walls of Dale, while seven\nmassive trolls, each of them carrying a catapult on their backs manned\nby a crew of seven Goblin Mercenaries climb out of the tunnels and set\nup their positions on a hilltop facing Dale. As Bard and his men, along\nwith Gandalf and Bilbo fall back to the city, the catapults were fired\nand inflicted heavy damage on the walls of the city. A portion of the\nwall was breached and collapsed by a troll-ram, and hundreds of orcs\npoured into the city, killing dozens of the unexpected Laketown\nvillagers inside. Rescue of Bain, Sigrid, and Tilda As the Guldur orcs\npour into Dale and terrorize the villagers, Bard's daughters Sigrid and\nTilda become separated from their brother Bain and are closely pursued\nby two orcs. Bain soon finds them and rescues his sisters by killing the\ntwo orcs with a sword he took out of the city armory. The three children\nsoon catch up with their father, who has led his men in a full-front\ncharge against the orcs and goblins. Bard soon finds his children\nwaiting for him at the abandoned marketplace, but soon discovers a large\nogre advancing upon them with his club raised above his head. Mounting\non an abandoned cart and riding down the sloping road, Bard rides the\ncart over the heads of his daughters and son, jumps off the cart, and\ndrives his sword through the ogre's chest, killing him instantly.\nRetreat to the Citadel After rescuing his children from the ogre, Bard\ntells them to gather the women and children and lead them to the safety\nof the citadel. At first, Bain, Sigrid, and Tilda refuse to do so and\nwant to stay with their father, but Bard, with a little help from Alfrid\nLickspittle, urges them to do what they are told. The children do not\nhesitate to help the surviving villagers gather together and make their\nway through the deserted buildings of the city until they arrive at the\ncitadel. While Alfrid, Bain, Sigrid, Tilda, and the Laketown villagers\nmake their way to the citadel, Bard gathers his men together and\nlaunches a fresh attack against the Guldur Orcs and armored trolls.\nBowmen fire arrows at the orcs and goblins, killing dozens of them in\nthe process. Laketown guards and militia keep back the orcs with spears\nand swords, with Bard fighting at their head. Gandalf strikes down a few\norcs with his staff and uses his sword Glamdring to cut down several\nothers, while Bilbo slashes at the legs of a few orcs with his sword\nSting. Arrival of Thranduil and the Wood Elves into Dale As more orcs\nand goblins, along with a small group of armored trolls, pour through\nseveral breaches into the walls of Dale, Thranduil gathers a company of\nhis warriors and archers and leads a charge towards the main gate.\nThranduil rides ahead of his forces on his giant stag, trampling down\nand slaying dozens of Guldur Orcs that have occupied the bridge leading\nto the gate. The stag even catches several orcs in his massive antlers,\nto which the king of the wood elves dispatches them quickly by beheading\nthem with his sword. Just as Thranduil rides through the open gates of\nthe city, goblin archers shoot down his stag, forcing the Elven king to\nleap down from his fallen mount and find himself surrounded by dozens of\nGuldur Orcs. Wielding his two curved Elven swords, Thranduil furiously\nattacks the orcs, slaying a large number of them before the rest of his\nwarriors join him in the fray. The wood elves fight furiously to protect\ntheir king, but dozens of them are slain by the pikes and scimitars of\nthe orcs in the process. The Dwarves and Men are driven back Bard and\nhis men stand their ground and try to kill as many orcs as possible, but\nthey are heavily outnumbered and fall one by one beneath the swords and\npikes of the orcs. With the villagers safely inside the citadel and\ndozens of his men being slain by the enemy, Bard orders his surviving\ntroops to pull back to the citadel. The Guldur Orcs then pursue the men,\nslaying several more as they retreat. Bilbo, Gandalf, Thranduil, and the\nSilvan Elves continue to fight on, killing many of the enemy as they\nbecome surrounded on all sides. Outside the city of Dale and the Lonely\nMountain, the situation goes from bad to worse for Dain and his\nwarriors. Many of the wood elves who had joined them at the beginning of\nthe battle are slain by the ferocity of the orcs, Ogres, and trolls,\nwhile a few hundred of the survivors pull back to Dale to join up with\ntheir king. The orcs and trolls begin to overpower Dáin's own troops,\ncrushing and slaying dozens of the Dwarves in the process. Three orcs\nkill Dáin's armored hog with their pikes and the dismounted Dwarf-lord\nfuriously attacks them, wielding his war hammer and crushing several of\nthem. He calls out to his troops and wonders where his cousin Thorin\nwas, stating that they needed him. Realizing that they would soon be\noverrun by the vehemence and overwhelming numbers of the enemy, Dáin\ncalls for a retreat to the barred gateway of Erebor. Dáin and more than\n300 surviving Dwarves manage to break through the ranks of the orcs and\nset up a defensive position by the main gateway. The remaining enemy\nforces of Azog, consisting of more than 10,000 Guldur Orcs, a dozen\nTrolls, a few Ogres, and several dozen Goblin Mercenaries also regroup\nand begin to advance upon the remaining Dwarves. Thorin and Bard rally\nthe Dwarves and Men Just as the orc forces of Azog begin to gain control\nof the fields outside Erebor and the city of Dale, inside the Lonely\nMountain Thorin broods for a while on his dragon-sickness. He then\nsuffers an hallucination and regains his sanity, realizing the wrongs\nthat he had done and that he must now join forces with Dáin, Bard, and\nThranduil outside Erebor. He confesses to his companions of the wrongs\nhe had done before he asks them to follow him into battle for the final\ntime. As Dáin and his remaining warriors prepare to make their final\nstand at the barred gateway of the Lonely Mountain, Azog orders his\nremaining Guldur forces to attack the Dwarves. Behind the ranks of\nGuldur Orcs, a large troll bearing a catapult manned by a crew of seven\nGoblin Mercenaries assembles itself facing the walls of Erebor. Six\nGuldur Olog-Hai Trolls armed with spiked wooden clubs lead the advance,\nwith the Guldur Orcs following behind them. Before the Dol Guldur army\nreaches the Dwarves, Bombur sounds the great war horn of Erebor which\ncauses the advancing enemy forces to halt in surprise and confusion.\nInside the walls of Dale, Bilbo, Gandalf, Thranduil, Bard, and the elves\nand men also hear the horn being sounded and know that Thorin has joined\nthe fight. Thorin and his twelve companions break open the front gate\nwith a massive golden bell and charge out into the battlefield, donned\nin their armor and wielding axes, hammers, swords, and round shields.\nDáin and his warriors then rally to Thorin and join him in the charge,\nletting loose their war cry and advancing upon Azog's forces. Three\nOlog-Hai Trolls are killed from a volley of spears hurled by the Dwarves\nbefore they reach their ranks, and the remaining three Olog-Hai are cut\ndown by the axes and swords of the Dwarven warriors. Thorin, Dáin, and\ntheir companions furiously collide against the ranks of the orcs,\nslaying hundreds of them in the process. Thorin, Fili, and Kili cut down\nseveral orcs with their short swords and shields, Dwalin, Nori, Bofur,\nand Dáin II Ironfoot strike down dozens of orcs with their war hammers,\nand Bombur wielding a flail smashes the skulls of a few orcs. The\ncatapult-bearing troll is also killed, the Goblin Mercenaries are\nslaughtered, and the catapult is quickly destroyed. Upon learning that\nThorin has rallied the Dwarves and is driving back the orcs outside Dale\nand Erebor, Bard seizes his chance and rallies his remaining soldiers to\nfight against the Orcs pouring the streets of Dale. With renewed courage\nand valor, the Men of Dale and Esgaroth charge the orcs in a desperate\nattempt to kill as many as possible. Bilbo and Gandalf also join the men\nin their fight, killing several orcs and Goblin Mercenaries in the\nprocess. The women of Esgaroth join the battle As Bard and his men\nlaunch their counterattack against the Orcs, Hilda Bianca grabs a spear\nand tells the women and children that they should stand with the men in\nbattle. As Bain and many of the women arm themselves with spears,\nknives, axes, and swords, Hilda and a few other women discover that\nAlfird has disguised himself as a woman to hide from the enemy. Hilda\ncalls him a coward and a weasel before leading the armed citizens out of\nthe main hall to face the enemy forces approaching the citadel. A jar\ntumbles off a rotting shelf and shatters on the stones, to which Alfrid\ndiscovers that it is filled with gold and silver coins from the Lonely\nMountain. Outside the citadel, a company of a hundred Guldur orcs pour\nout of the streets of the city and advance upon the citadel with raised\nshields and drawn scimitars. Hilda, Bain, and the women of Esgaroth\ncharge the Orcs with their weapons drawn and collide into their ranks.\nThe Orcs fought viciously, but soon found themselves being cut down by\nthe dozens by the ferocity of the villagers. A large orc wielding an\niron scimitar is gored in the stomach by Hilda's spear, a few others are\ncut down by Bain's own sword, and the women slay a large number of\nothers before the few remaining orcs retreat in utter panic. Bofur vs.\nthe Amputated War Troll Outside Dale and Erebor, Thorin has successfully\nrallied the Dwarves and inflicted heavy casualties upon the orcs and\ntrolls, but Thorin, his cousin Dáin, and their warriors are still\nheavily outnumbered. During the battle, Bofur discovers a large\namputated war troll wreaking havoc among the ranks of Dáin's warriors,\ncrushing dozens of dwarves with its flail arms and spiked club-feet.\nWith the help of Nori and Gloin, Bofur manages to climb onto the troll's\nback, kills the orc driving the troll with an axe, and takes control of\nthe troll. He reins in the troll and directs it into the ranks of the\nGuldur Orcs, crushing dozens of orcs in the process. The Dwarf-Chariot\nvs. Trolls, Ogres, and Wargs After rescuing his cousin from a few Guldur\nOrcs, Dáin and Thorin reunite with each other on the battlefield. Dáin\npoints out that there are too many orcs for the dwarves to handle and\ntells Thorin that he hopes he has a plan. Thorin, upon mounting one of\nthe few remaining armored goats, tells Dáin that he plans to ride to\nRavenhill and kill Azog once and for all. Dáin then asks Thorin on how\nhe plans to fight single-handed to Azog's command post on Ravenhill, but\nbefore Thorin can respond, a dwarf-chariot drawn by a team of six rams\nappears. Balin drives the team, while Dwalin takes control of the\narrow-launcher and Fili and Kili position themselves on either side of\nthe chariot. As Thorin and his companions ride towards Ravenhill, Dáin\nstates calmly, “May Durin save you all.” Thorin and his companions\nimmediately charge into the front ranks of a large battalion of Guldur\nOrcs, slaughtering dozens of them in the process. Azog notices this and\nsignals for his war beasts to attack. Six aggressive ogres lumber\ntowards the dwarf-chariot, but the goats and chariot spring off the top\nof a rock that is towering above the ogres, and the scythe-blades on the\nchariot's wheels severs the ogres' heads, killing them all instantly. At\nthe same time, a massive Troll armed with sickle blades attached to his\narms charges straight at the dwarves, but Balin turns the goats sharply\nto the right and drives the chariot onto a frozen river. The troll\nsprings into the river, breaking the ice beneath his weight, and crawls\nacross the ice after the chariot. Kili tries shooting at the troll with\nhis bow, including an arrow that pierces the troll's right claw, but the\ntroll slowly gains on the dwarves. Bofur immediately comes to the rescue\nby having the amputated troll swing its flail arms into the troll's neck\nand skull, but the dying troll drags the amputated troll into the river\nwith him. Bofur barely manages to escape by falling off the troll's back\nand landing on the ice for safety. Balin, Dwalin, Fili, and Kili\nimmediately discover a second armored troll standing in the middle of\nthe frozen river, holding over its head a wooden bridge with dozens of\nGoblin Mercenary archers and orc archers mounted on it and blocking the\nchariot. Fili and Kili with their bows and Dwalin with the arrow\nlauncher immediately fire at the troll, piercing the troll's jaw and\nthroat with several bolts and killing the brute instantly. The goblins\nand orcs are killed as well, and the chariot safely passes over the dead\ntroll's body. Suddenly, a pack of wargs, with a dozen or so warg-riders\nappear on either side of the chariot and attack the goats pulling the\nchariot and the dwarves mounted on it. Despite Dwalin's, Fili's, and\nKili's attempts to protect the goats and they manage to slay several\nwargs and orcs, the wargs managed to pull down and kill three of the\ngoats during the chase. With only three remaining goats pulling the\nheavy chariot and the wargs closing in behind them, the dwarves know\nthat they will never make it to Ravenhill. Balin immediately tells his\nbrother to cut the traces and ride the remaining goats to Ravenhill,\nvolunteering to stay behind and hold back the wargs as long as he could.\nDwalin, Fili, and Kili mount on the three goats, cut them free of the\nchariot, and ride them onward to Ravenhill, while Balin activates the\narrow launcher and kills all of the remaining wargs and warg-riders.\nDwalin, Fili, and Kili soon catch up to Thorin, who leads them up the\nslopes of Ravenhill and slay a small force of Guldur orcs stationed at\nthe foot of the hill. Death of Alfrid Lickspittle Back in the city of\nDale, Alfrid gathers up a huge amount of coins into his corset and\nattempts to escape from the battle, but he is confronted by a massive\nogre who raises its club to kill him. Alfrid is quickly saved by Bard,\nwho kills the ogre by firing an arrow into its chest. Bard angrily\norders Alfrid to get up, but Alfrid argues that he makes his own\ndecisions. Though he calls him a coward, Bard reluctantly lets Alfrid\ngo. Shortly after this, Alfrid ran into trouble yet again. While Gandalf\nwas attempting to ward off a troll with his new staff, Alfrid had\nfoolishly hidden himself inside the net of a trebuchet. Gandalf's staff\nwas malfunctioning however, and as the troll advanced Alfrid panicked\nand sent a few coins tumbling from his corset. One coin landed on the\ntrigger, and the trebuchet launched the screaming Alfrid into the trolls\nmouth, where he was suffocated to death. In turn the troll choked on him\nand died too as Gandalf watched in surprise. Stalemate The counterattack\nby Bard and the townspeople of Esgaroth has managed to stabilize the\nsituation, but Legolas and Tauriel arrive with news that Bolg is\napproacing from the north with an army of Gundabad Orcs. Gandalf tries\nto persuade Thranduil to dispatch his remaining forces to Ravenhill to\nwarn Thorin of the unexpected attack, but Thranduil refuses to spill any\nmore blood of his people and decides to depart for Mirkwood. Thranduil\nand his troops reach the main gateway, but are halted by Tauriel and\nLegolas. After a short argument and learning that his son prefers to die\ndefending the sons of Durin than saving his own life, the Elven-king\nmakes up his mind and follows Legolas and Tauriel to Ravenhill. Ending\nand aftermath The arrival of the Eagles and the death of Azog ended the\nsiege. The surviving Orcs retreated to the tunnels, allowing the\nexhausted Elves and Men to claim a pyrrhic victory. An agreement was\nreached in the aftermath with Bard becoming King of Dale at the end of\nthe battle and his people getting paid by Dain Ironfoot the riches that\nThorin had promised them.",

Aragorn sang: Through Rohan over fen and field where\nthe long grass grows The West Wind comes walking, and about the walls it\ngoes. ‘What news from the West, O wandering wind, do you bring to me\ntonight? Have you seen Boromir the Tall by moon or by starlight? ‘I saw\nhim ride over seven streams, over waters wide and grey, I saw him walk\nin empty lands until he passed away Into the shadows of the North, I saw\nhim then no more. The North Wind may have heard the horn of the son of\nDenethor, ‘O Boromir! From the high walls westward I looked afar, But\nyou came not from the empty lands where no men are.’ Then Legolas sang:\nFrom the mouths of the Sea the South Wind flies, from the sandhills and\nthe stones, The wailing of the gulls it bears, and at the gate it moans.\n‘What news from the South, O sighing wind, do you bring to me at eve?\nWhere now is Boromir the Fair? He tarries and I grieve. ‘Ask not of me\nwhere he doth dwell – so many bones there lie, On the white shores and\nthe dark shores under the stormy sky, So many have passed down Anduin to\nfind the flowing Sea. Ask of the North Wind news of them the North Wind\nsends to me!’ ‘O Boromir! Beyond the gate the seaward roads runs south,\nBut you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey sea’s mouth’. Then\nAragorn sang again: From the Gate of the Kings the North Wind rides, and\npast the roaring falls, And clear and cold about the tower its loud horn\ncalls. ‘What news from the North, O mighty wind, do you bring to me\ntoday? What news of Boromir the bold? For he is long away.’ ‘Beneath\nAmon Hen I heard his cry. There many foes he fought, His cloven shield,\nhis broken sword, they to the water brought. His head so proud, his face\nso fair, his limbs they laid to rest, And Rauros, golden Rauros-falls,\nbore him upon its breast. ‘O Boromir! The Tower of Guard shall ever\nnorthward gaze, To Rauros, golden Rauros-falls, until the end of days."

Smaug spots Bilbo and chases after him, and he is quickly overrun\nby the dragon once they reach the Gallery of Kings.

    "text": "The FRONT GATE was a common term for the GATE OF EREBOR, the wide arched\nmain entrance of the Dwarf-realm of Erebor. The Great Chamber of\nThrór was near the Gate. The entrance was at the head of the valley\nformed by the two southern ridges of rock thrust out from the southern\nslopes of Erebor. Out of the gateway sprang the stream that grew into\nthe River Running. Through the gate passed a stone-paved road, wide\nenough for many men abreast. The gate itself was a tall arch and at one\ntime displayed carven work, but during Smaug's residence in the mountain\nthe opening had become worn, splintered, and blackened. From the gate\none could look out upon Dale (or its ruins during the time of the\nDragon). History In T.A. 2770 Smaug descend upon Erebor and entered the\nMountain via the Front Gate, which unfortunately was wide enough to\naccommodate him. Over time Smaug had broken and blocked all of the other\ngates to the Mountain (except for the secret Back Door), leaving only\nthe Front Gate for his use. In T.A. 2941 Smaug was slain by Bard of\nLake-town. Thorin and company, having entered the Mountain through\nthe Back Door, came out the Front Gate not knowing the fate of the\ndragon. When the dwarves learned of Smaug's death they returned to the\nMountain and built a high thick wall of squared stones across the\ngate.This barrier allowed them to hold off the forces of the Woodland\nRealm and the Lake-Men while Thorin awaited the coming of Dáin II\nIronfoot. However, hard upon Dáin's arrival the Goblins of Bolg also\nappeared and the Battle of Five Armies began. In the middle of the\nbattle Thorin and his companion dwarves levered the wall at the Front\nGate to fall outwards and they then rushed into the battle. After the\nbattle was over it was at the Front Gate that Bilbo Baggins took his\nleave of the surviving dwarves before heading home. Dáin was less\nfortunate: he fell in battle during the War of the Ring at the threshold\nof the Gate, defending the body of the fallen King Brand of Dale, but it\nprotected his people in the short and unsuccessful siege that followed.",

It was during Thrór's reign that Smaug descended on Lonely\nMountain and drove the Dwarves into exile. Long after his kingdom's\ndestruction, Thrór passed the ring to his son Thráin, who dwelt for many\nyears as an exile from his ancient home. At last, Thráin set out on an\nill-fated quest to regain his kingdom, but he was captured by the spies\nof Sauron, and the Ring of Thrór was lost forever. Many Dwarves however\ndid not know the fate of the Ring, and thought that it was lost in Moria\nwhen Thrór was killed by Azog. It was thought that one of the reasons\nBalin wished to reclaim Moria was to find the Ring. In the Council of\nElrond, Gandalf told Glóin that Balin would not find the Ring there, as\nit was given to Thráin and lost in Dol Guldur.",

This chapter is preceded by\n“The Tale of Tinuviel”, and followed by “The Fall of Gondolin”. Chapter\nsynopsis The story of Túrin and the dragon Glorund is told aloud by one\nnamed Eltas, at the request of Lindo. The story Eltas narrates remains\nvery accurate to its later and final version in ''Quenta SiImarillion,\n''and its drawn-out version in _The Children of Húrin_,'' ''save for\nnumerous names of characters and places that Tolkien would later alter:\n- Túrin is initially only named _Turambar_. In the final version of the\nstory, _Turambar_ is an epithet given to him later. - Throughout not\nonly this tale but all tales compiled into _The Book of Lost Tales 2_,\n“Gnome” is the term referring to the race of Arda that later would be\nemended to “Elf”. Thus _Gnomish_' _'was_ the term that referred to the\nlanguage later named _Sindarin._ - _Foalókë_, in the setting wherein\nEltas tells this story, is a term that translated as “name of a serpent\nthat guarded a treasure”, from the Quenya words _foa_ ('hoard' or\n'treasure') and ''lókë ''('snake'). The name refers to the dragon\nGlorund, who, like the familiar and later Smaug of _The Hobbit_, claimed\nand guarded a hoard of valuable jewels, deep within Nargothrond. -\n''Aryador ''was the name of the land of Hisilómë among Men. ''Hisilómë\n''was later changed to _Hithlum._ - _Mormakil_, one of the epithets\ngiven to Túrin (meaning 'black sword'), would later be changed to\n_Mormegil._ - ''Failivrin ''was the name of the female Gnome who later\nwould be changed to _Finduilas_. - ''Galweg _is the earlier name of\nFailivrin's father, whose name would later be changed to _Orodreth__.''\n- ''Nínin-Udathriol ''was the first Gnomish (i.e. Elvish) name given to\nthe Battle of Unnumbered Tears. In the final version of this tale, the\nbattle is called _Nirnaeth Arnoediad._ - _Flinding_ is the name of the\ncharacter whose role would later be mostly taken over by Gwindor, an elf\nof Nargothrond. - ''Gurtholfin ''was the first name given to Túrin's\nsword. The name meant 'wand of death', and was later changed to\n_Gurthang_, which means 'death of iron'. - _Peleg_ was the name of the\nfather of Tuor. This name would later be changed to _Huor._ - _The Great\nWrack_ is the term Eltas uses to refer to the end of the world, whereat\nTúrin would “stand beside Fionwë” while Melkor curses Túrin's sword.\nFollowing Eltas' telling of this tale, Christopher Tolkien gives his\nnotes and analyses of things such as the manuscript and typescript\nversions of the story, the changes underwent of character names, plot,\nevents, and of things referenced in other early, various Middle-earth\ntales Tolkien had written, along with comparisons of said things."

The story she narrates\nremains very accurate to its later and final version in ''Quenta\nSiImarillion, ''save for various things that would later be altered: -\nTinúviel is only known by that name, which in this version is her given\nname and not an epithet given by Beren; the name _Lúthien_ never\nappears. - The antagonist whose role in Beleriand would later be that of\nSauron was the “Prince of Cats”, named ''Tevildo, ''or _Thû_. -\n_Tinwelint_ was the name of the King of Artanor, who later would be\nchanged to Thingol, King of Doriath. - _Gwendeling_ was the name of\nTinwelint's wife, who later would be changed to the Maia Melian, Queen\nof Doriath. - _Umuiyan_ is the name of a character who is Tevildo's\ndoorkeeper. - _Karkaras_ is the name of the beast-villain who later\nwould be the wolf Carcharoth. - When Beren cut the Silmaril from\nMelkor's crown, he used a kitchen-knife of Tevildo's in this tale.\nLater, Angrist is the knife that he uses. - Glorund the dragon is\nmentioned in the tale - he later becomes Glaurung. - Two named giants\nare mentioned, Nan and Gilim. In a certain song that Tinúviel sings,\nthey are noted for their length of sword and height of neck,\nrespectively. (Nan's sword is said to be named _Glend__._) - _Dairon_, a\nminstrel and lover of Tinúviel whom she does not choose, would later be\nnamed _Daeron._ In this version, he is Tinúviel's brother. Following\nVëannë's telling of this tale, Christopher Tolkien gives his notes and\nanalyses of things such as the manuscript and typescript versions of the\nstory, the changes underwent of character names, plot, events, and of\nthings referenced in other early, various Middle-earth tales Tolkien had\nwritten, along with comparisons of said things."

    "text": "THE SHIBBOLETH OF FËANOR is the eleventh chapter of Christopher\nTolkien's _The Peoples of Middle-earth_, which is the twelfth and most\nrecently compiled volume of _The History of Middle-earth._ “Shibboleth”\nis a rare word defined as _a custom, principle, or belief distinguishing\na particular class or group of people, esp. a long-standing one regarded\nas outmoded or no longer important._ The chapter that follows is “The\nProblem of Ros”. Synopsis This chapter covers the titular essay\nby J.R.R. Tolkien which explains the shift from the monograph\n(letter) _þ_ (as in English 'thing') to ''s ''in the spoken 'Exilic'\nElven dialect of Quenya, and how this phonological change became\nconnected to broader circumstances. Also included, however, are lengthy\n'excursuses' from this essay regarding Elven 'mother-names', the\nparentage of Gil-galad, the westward migration of the Edain, and the\nnames of various prominent Noldor. There is additionally a portion of\nthe main body of the chapter that tells of Galadriel. The premise of the\ndiscussion in this chapter is the 'anomolous' use of _s_: Tolkien\nreasons that since in Sindarin (the vernacular tongue of the Noldor\nafter their exile) þ was common, the change þ > s must have become\nwidespread before the Noldor left Valinor. And on the basis of the\npresence of þ in Vanyarin and Telerin, and its retention in written\nExilic Quenya the Noldor must have been able to produce this sound. It\nis thus concluded that the shift from þ to _s_ was “conscious and\ndeliberate”. With that established, Tolkien explains the adoption of\nthis linguistic change by the majority of Noldor and its historical\ncontext within the Middle-earth canon. Originally, he explains, the\nlingual change was criticised by loremasters “who pointed out that the\ndamage this merging would do in confusing stems and their derivatives\nthat had been distinct in sound and sense had not yet been sufficiently\nconsidered”. Chief among these 'reactionaries' was Fëanor, who opposed\nthe shift from ''þ _to_ s_ because of his attachment to the _þ_ sound,\nwhich was due to its presence in the mother-name of his mother\nMíriel, _Þerindë_ (Quenya for 'Needlewoman'). Following the death of\nMíriel and the antagonism this led to between Fëanor\nand Finwë's children by Indis, this formerly scholarly debate became,\nsurprisingly, politicised. The use of _þ_ by Fëanor and his followers\nbecame entrenched, and he saw the growing adoption of _s_ by the Noldor,\nand especially now by Finwë and Indis themselves, as a deliberate insult\nto his mother and a plot by the Valar to weaken his influence amongst\nthe Noldor. In this way Fëanor made _þ > s_ a political _shibboleth_; he\nwould name himself the 'Son of the _Þerindë', _and he once said to his\nchildren, \"_We speak as is right, and as King Finwë himself did before\nhe was led astray. We are his heirs by right and the elder house. Let\nthem _sá-sí_, if they can speak no better.\"'' Note on the text The text\ncomprising this chapter was drawn from a single unfinished typescript of\nTolkien's, that included handwritten notes, composed sometime\nafter 1968. According to Christopher Tolkien, it would be typical of his\nfather's latest work on the Middle-earth mythology in that the\nproduction of new material resulted largely from discursive attempts to\nexplain anomalies and unanswered questions in his earlier work, usually\nconcerning philology, which often resulted in a wide variety of subjects\nbeing addressed."

    "text": "'''Aldarion and Erendis: The Mariner's Wife '''is the second chapter in\nPart Two of _Unfinished Tales_. It mainly concerns the first Ship-king\nof Númenor, Tar-Aldarion, and his wife, and how they differed. J.R.R.\nTolkien composed this tale's final form no earlier than 1965. The\nchapter preceding is “A Description of the Island of Númenor”, and the\nchapter that follows is “The Line of Elros”. Synopsis At the beginning\nof the chapter, Aldarion's father Tar-Meneldur is described, as a\nrightful king devoted to the Island of Númenor, but whose true passion\nwas the study of the stars. He had two daughters and one son, named\nAnardil, who would be known among the Kings of Númenor as\n_Tar-Aldarion_. Through time, disagreement arose between Aldarion and\nhis father concerning the Sea, for Aldarion loved it ever since he was a\nchild. His first odyssey towards Middle-earth was made in the year SA\n725, under the guidance of Vëantur his own grandfather, and it was\nduring that journey upon his ship _Númerrámar_ that he befriended Elves\nCirdan and Ereinion (Gil-galad). More sea voyages followed afterwards,\nagainst the wish of his father, and in between them at one point he\nfounded the Guild of Venturers. In the hundredth year of his life, he\nwas proclaimed heir to the throne, and at the celebration of this event\nhe met Erendis, daughter of Beregar. Though she seemed beautiful to him,\nAldarion refused to commit to marriage because of his commitment to his\npassion for marine life. When Aldarion finally courted her, it was\nErendis who avoided the union, for she did not want to share Aldarion\nwith the sea. Only after many years they were engaged, and even more\npassed until they were married, in the year SA 870. While being husband\nand wife, they did not manage to reconcile their differences. A few\nyears after their only child was born, named Ancalimë, Aldarion\ncontinued his explorations in Middle-earth. Erendis grew bitter of the\nperpetual waiting, until finally she left their home in Armenelos,\ntaking their young daughter with her into the heart of Emerië. Upon his\nreturn, Aldarion found his home locked and his father even more cold\ntowards him. It was the same with his wife, when he pursued her to her\nnew home. But here the tale takes an unexpected turn, as it is revealed\nin a letter Gil-galad wrote towards King Meneldur that Aldarion did not\nleave his home out of selfishness, but rather his voyages were caused by\nthe threat from Sauron, which he had long seen and tried to prevent by\nbuilding the outpost Vinyalondë at the mouth of the Gwathló river in\nMiddle-earth. Tar-Meneldur, realizing that he did not share the\nvisionary mind of his son, nor his capacity to face upcoming events,\nannounced his abdication and proclaimed Aldarion as the succeeding King\nof Númenor. Aldarion's reign ends in the year SA 1075, and his and\nErendis' daughter succeeded him as queen. Aldarion's death was two\ndecades following, in SA 1098."

In that letter, it appears as part of\na postscript reminding Frodo to make sure that the “Strider” he meets is\n“the real Strider”. The poem thus appears in that context as a means of\nidentifying Aragorn. Aragorn indeed later quotes the first two lines,\nnot knowing the poem is in the letter, and this does help to confirm his\nidentity. Bilbo himself recites the poem at the Council of Elrond when\nBoromir expresses doubts about Aragorn's claim to be the Heir of\nIsildur. Analysis The first line is clearly a re-working of the\ntraditional proverb “All that glitters is not gold”, reversing its\nmeaning. The second line, perhaps one of the lines from Tolkien's work\nmost often quoted out of context, refers to Aragorn's travels. The third\nand fourth lines concern Aragorn's heritage, he is Isildur's heir and\nhis bloodline remained hidden from 'frost like terror' of Sauron, in the\nNorth as Rangers. While the remaining lines describe his destiny. The\n“blade that was broken” refers to the Shards of Narsil, which is indeed\nremade for Aragorn into Andúril."

History The NÚMENÓREANS (Ad._Adûnai_)\nwere the men of Númenór, those descendants of the three houses of the\nEdain who had settled the Island Realm of Númenór in the second\nAge.Those Númenóreans of the Elendili who settled the coasts of the\nWestlands and founded the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor were also known\nas the Dúnedain and they continued to speak Sindarin as their formal\nspeech of etiquette although they used Adûnaic as their lingua franca,\nand later its descendant Westron.The King's Men or Aruwanai who settled\nthe coastlands south of Umbar were called Black Númenóreans by their\nnorthern brethren Appearance The Adûnai regarded the pale skin of the\nEldar as prestigious, however many among the hard working rural\npopulation and the sun-tanned mariners had ruddy or darker skin, so pale\nskin became the ideal of the upper classes. In later times it was was\nseen as a symbol of pure-blooded númenórean descend, as the former free\nworking classes rose to the status of urban citizens and the lower\nclasses were replaced by unfree slaves imported from all over\nMiddle-Earth and a mixed-blooded class of unfree and semi-unfree\nfreedmen evolved. The original Adûnai were a tall folk, 6 feet, 4 inches\nbeing not uncommon among them, although their later descendants used to\nbe smaller in statue. Most common Adûnai were black or brown haired,\nbeing largely descendants of the Beorians and Halethrim, but in the\nroyal line there also were some flaxen or golden-haired families,\noffspring of the house of Hador. Adûnai were usually grey-eyed, though\nbrown or blue eyes were not uncommon. Religion The Adûnai revered the\nOne-god Êru and his subject-spirits the Avalôi or Êru-bêni, especially\nGimilnitîr or Avradî and Amân or Adûnakhôr, but also Abâr, Agân, Azâr\nand Magân.Later under Zigurûn's tutelage they largely abolished the\nreverence of Êru and made the cult of Alkar or Mulkhêr their imperial\nreligion, the few remaining faithful or Elendili mostly left Númenór for\nthe colonies of the northwest. Culture The Adûnai were the greatest\nSeamen and Scholars among the mortals and certainly also the most\nskilled artificians and warriors.However with the drowning of Númenór\nmuch of the Adûnai's knowledge was lost forever and their Dúnadan and\nAruwanai descendants only inherited a shadow of their forefathers'\nformer glory. Lifespan While the early half-elven royal line of the\nnúmenórean Kings lived up to 400 years and even the lesser Númenoreans\noften lived up to 200 years, their Elendili and Aruwanai descendants of\nthe late third age only came to live for no longer than 100 years, 150\nyears being a sign of royal descent, with the notable exception of\nElessar I who died at the age of 210.",

History Before the foundation of Arnor there was already a\nsizable Númenórean population living in Eriador, a result of the slow\nemigration of Númenóreans which had started under Tar-Meneldur and\nTar-Aldarion.

The Men of Arnor were severely\ndepleted by the War of the Last Alliance, in which many of them fell.\nNonetheless, the land of Arnor survived for nearly a thousand years\nunder ten different Kings. The eldest son, Amlaith, claimed Kingship\nover all Arnor but was reduced to only ruling the region of Arthedainas\nhis kingdom, while the other sons founded the kingdoms of Cardolanand\nRhudaur. The largest part of the populace were Eriadorian Commoners, who\nwere ruled by an upper class of Northern Dúnedain, though there was a\nbroad mixed-blooded middle-class, especially in the urban centers and\nthe lesser Nobility or Gentry. Their realms were lost during the Third\nAge, and for the millennium before the War of the Ring, they were a\nwandering people.

History The Dragon-spell\npower is known to have originated with Glaurung, the first dragon, who\nemployed it against Túrin and others. Applications As with much of\ntolkiens work, little detail is given into the limits and uses of this\npower. Glaurung is known to have used it against Túrin , using it to\nparalyze him, preventing him from acting despite hundreds of people\nbeing dragged away. He also used it to influence Túrin , making him\nthink Niënor was suffering despite being perfectly fine. Glaurung would\nalso use it to induce total amnesia in Niënor, and later returning all\nher memories to her, all with words. Smaug would also use an ability\nsimilar to this. Bilbo would notice a beam of light coming from smaug's\neyes (likely due to his senses being enhanced by the ring). Whenever\nthis beam passed over bilbo he would have a strong desire to remove the\none ring from his fingers."

He represented Sauron's manipulative and\ndeceitful nature. He was rumoured to have once been a king from the east\nwho brought Sauron the heads of the two blue Istari as gifts. Others say\nthat he returned across the seas with Sauron after the fall of Númenor.\nStill others claim that he was the Dark Lord himself, taking fair form\nagain within Mordor. As with the Mouth of Sauron, the Black Hand's true\nname was unknown. There were many stories of his origins. All of them\nwere lies. He was a master of deceit, and he served the Dark lord with\nabsolute loyalty. Biography The Third Age The Black Hand of Sauron\npersonally killed the family of Talion (a ranger of the Black Gate),\nboth his wife and his son and then proceeded to slit the throat of\nTalion himself. However, Talion was bound to the spirit of the famous\nElven smith Celebrimbor and still held presence, half wraith, half man.\nThis caused Talion to seek out the Black Hand, in order to kill him and\nexact his revenge, in turn weakening Sauron's grip upon Mordor. After\nthe formation of their army within the Uruk ranks, Talion and\nCelebrimbor fought the Talons of the Black Hand (his personal Uruk\nguards) and killed them, then ascended the Black Gate, where the Black\nHand awaited them. The Black Hand showed Celebrimbor a memory of his\npast and attempted to force him to leave Talion's body by using his\nconnection to the darkness. Abruptly, Sauron emerged in the Black Hand's\nplace and assaulted the weakened Talion. However, Talion was able to\njoin with Celebrimbor again after striking him down.

    "text": "SÎRESHA was a river located in the region of Sirayn. It ran 600 miles\nfrom its source in the Tûr Betark, in the mighty Káraskon Ravine, south\nof Ny Chennacatt, to its delta in the Bay of Ormal. The cities of Sirayn\nwere founded along the Sîresha river and its tributaries. Meltwater from\ntwo glaciers, as well as the torrential rains falling on the mountain\npeaks, feed its upper reaches to create a fastmoving current. The\nyellowish color of the water is due to the yellow sediment or loess\neroded from the cliffs of the Tûr Betark. During Sadayn, the wettest\nseason, a traveller following the foothills east from Ciryatandor must\ndetour north to the Mára Gaib (“Bridge of the Old-settlers”) to cross\nthe flood-swollen Sîresha. This remarkable engineering feat bridges the\nriver at the narrowest point between Tartaust and Baud Selen. Dropping\nthrough the Skara Riskál (“Wraith’s Teeth Rapids”), the river is joined\nat Tartaust by a small tributary and broadens to sweep smoothly along\nthe bottom of a wide gorge. The current passes rapidly through chasms\ncarved from mesas and rock outcroppings as well as across the vast\nplains of the scrubland typical of Chennacatt. Just above Rask, before\nthe Maudar adds its flow to the Sîresha, the river drops in the Skara\nSársus (“Cougar’s Gullet Rapids”), the last of the white water that\nmakes the upper half of the Sîresha unnavigable. The lower Sîresha is a\ntamer stream, flowing between low banks and meandering in ever greater\nloops as it approaches the Bay of Ormal. It shrugs once more at the\nruins of Charnesra, where unusal rock formations in the river create\nlethal undercurrents and an obstructed channel for water traffic. Young\nand daring adventurers sometimes brave the swirling current, but more\nprudent travellers and commercial bargemasters still use the old canal\nthrough the ruins to avoid the possibility of sinking their vessels. The\ngreat forest bordering Isra, the Sára Bask, grows right up to the river,\nits scrubby undergrowth and hardy trees overhanging the southern bank.\nTorbusaud (“Greenbarks”), slow barges of herb pickers, patrol this\nsection of the Sîresha to allow workers to efficiently harvest the\nwood’s bounty while still afloat. The lazy Sîrsis river flows between\ntrunks of the famous bausk trees (known for their bizarely corkscrewed\nlimbs) of the forest to join the Sîresha. The combined currents dump\ninto the Mard Isauba, a finger of the greater Bay of Ormal, at Tûl\nHarar."

    "text": "The SÁRA BASK was a vast sunburned forest located in Sirayn, that\nstretched from the junction of the Sîresha and Sîrsis rivers to the\ncoast of the Bay of Ormal. The wood is situated on the hilly flanks of\nthe Tûr Betark and depends solely on runoff from the mountains. Hardy\nspecies of trees well adapted to the intense sunlight of the region,\nsuch as cork, olive, and fig, as well as the date palm, flourish on the\nlower slopes of the foothills. Equally tough scrub bushes create\nirnpassible thickets between their trunks. Mangrove thrives in\ndepressions along the Sîresha where flood waters are trapped and\nstagnate for several months, while magnolia and willow occupy the better\ndrained riverbanks and streambanks within the Sára Bask. Coconut palms,\nmarauha palms, and sakpalms grow in profusion along the coast of the\nMard Isauba. Plametto marks the western fringe of the wood where the\ndurable soils of Isra hold cultivated fields along the Sîrsis. Needle-\nand broad-leaved decidous trees fill the higher elevations of the Sára\nBask, giving way to the Sîranean and Tasab spruces on the crests of the\nfoothills. Flora and fauna Numerous streams and small rivers, fed by\nrainfall on the peaks of the Tûr Betark, water the foothills covered by\nthe Sára Bask. Inured to intense sunlight moderated by little cloud\ncover and scant rainfall, but abundant ground water, the species that\ncomprise the wood are a hardy and select group. Figs, olives, cork, date\npalms, and _torbachenna_ trees (bearing fruit similar to an olive, but\nlarger, with yellow coloring) thrive on the lower slopes. A large\nvariety of scrub bushes create tangled thickets between their trunks.\nThe eastern fringes of the forest, along the coast, are comprised of a\nvariety of palms: coconut, _marauba_ (bearing a fruit similar to a cross\nbetween a coconut and a pineapple), and _sak_ (fiber from the cocoons of\nthe sakworms that eat its leaves can be spun into a cloth with the\ncomfort of silk and the durability of linen). The westem edge of the\nwood, along the Sîrsis and the fields of Isra, is dominated by the\npalmetto. Depressions in the land adjacent to the Sîresha, where flood\nwaters sometimes remain for months, harbor concentrations of mangrove,\nwhile the drier stream banks possess groves of magnolia and willow.\nBroad- and needle-leaved deciduous trees such as the _muna_ and the\n_baranaud_ predominate at higher elevations. Frequent clearings on these\nsteeper inclines shelter _farain_ grass and _ketatas_ stalks. The\nhilltops sport stands of the Siranean and Tasab spruces. _Tauvezin_ moss\nthrives amidst their roots. The fig, olive, cork, date plams and\n_torhachenna_ trees possess obvious value to merchants and traders, but\nthe plants thriving on the forest floor attract equal attention. Their\npollens and spores are collected by skilled herbalists from _Isra_ and\n_Chennacatt_ for use as medicines, combat enhancers, and antidotes to\npoisons. The Yatali-gan, dwellers within the Sára Bask, harvest an even\ngreater portion of the wood’s flora to concoct healing infusions and\nsalves. For every beneficial herb, there are dozens of dangerous\nvarieties. Without the knowledge of a naturalist, it is not advised to\nsample at random. A large proportion of the spices commonly utilized in\nthe cuisines of Sirayn are native to the forest. Gathering these\ncondiments can be very hazardous. Wild animals and the Yatali-gan add to\nthe dangers posed by poisonous spores and roagh terrain. Most successful\nspice traders cultivate hybrids adapted to slightly dryer soils in small\nplots near their homes in Isra. The favorites include musky _sinabaud_,\nsweet _nantarb_, zesty _charbis_, and subtle _rosain_. - Eddij - This\nbeny is highly prized in Sirayn. If its juices are placed in the eyes of\na deceased person within 30 days of their death, the individual will be\nrestored to life. Very rare, it grows only along small streams in the\ndeepest parts of the Sára Bask. Only the fabulously wealthy can afford\nthis herb. - Copal - Copal is a brittle, aromatic, yellow-red resin\ncollected from _bîritrees_ in the Sára Bask. The resin is highly valued\nto woodworkers who use it to make high quality vamishes. - Kasia - Kasia\ncauses slight euphoria when used in large quantities. The spice is made\nfrom the ground nut of the _kasia_ tree and is used in many of the\ndishes throughout Sirayn. It is also a favored trade item. - Rud Tekma -\nMages throughout Sirayn seek the fruit of the tekma. The fruit of this\nplant enhances a magician’s abilities when using spells. The effects\nlast one hour, affecting movement and melee negatively, but magic\npositively. The fruit is relatively addictive. The predominance of\nstreams in the Sára Bask permits a larger animal population to thrive in\nthe region. Numerous insects buzz from flower to flower when the fig,\nolive, and _torbachenna_ trees are in bloom. Birds, reptiles, and\nrodents eat the insects and in tum are preyed upon by larger animals.\nSome of the wasps common to the lower slopes of the wood possess a venom\nso powerful that victims of their sting die of anaphylactic shock within\nminutes. Only the Yatali-gan have leamed how to create salves that\nconsistently drive off these humming menaces. Some of the larger insects\nand grubs serve as delicacies in the feasts of the resourceful\nforest-dwellers. Baboons, small deer, squirrels, cougars, and chipmunks,\nnumber among the larger species of the wood . Small birds of\ngoldspeckled brown plumage occupy nests in the tree boughs or hide among\nthe shadows of the thickets on the forest floor. Many are hunted by the\nYatali-gan for food. The _gacalac_ alone is sought for the metallic\nappearance of its gold, silver, and copper-toned plumage. A few are\ntaken as pets. The buzz of insects, broken by infrequent birdcalls,\ndominates the Sára Bask at all times. It is rumored that when the\nfoothills are quiet even the spirits of the wood tremble. -\nA-lori-ma-lau - The a-lori-ma-lau, also known as Large Cat, Hill Cat or\nKirsis, is the most feared predator of the Sára Bask. The male and\nfemale of the species hunt in pairs and will stalk humans. Their coat is\na golden brown. Yatali-gan believe that they are the claws of the\nspirits of the woods. - Gacalac - The gacalac is an exotic bird with\nvery bright plumage. The plumage gleams like gold and silver and is used\nfor decorations and adomment. Tamed gacalac are kept for show and for\ntheir beautiful voices. - Kastaba - The kastaba is a small poisonous\nbronze toad. Just holding the toad in one’s hands will cause extreme\npain and precipitate a weakening of the individual ’s constitution. If\nhe or she wipes his or her eyes with an infected digit, the individual\nmay become blind. The secretions of the kasataba may be used to make a\npaste that will kill if placed on a sword edge or an arrow point. If the\nvictim does not die from the poison, he or she will faII into a coma and\nbe permanently blind upon awakening. - Ru-lani-lapu - The ru-lani-lapu,\nalso known as Red Baboon, Tangat or Safataub, is a holy animal to the\nYatali-gan of the Sára Bask. Moderately intelligent, they make very nice\npets. Some thieves in Sirayn have trained these apes to pilfer small\nobjects. The baboons normally weigh less than 20 pounds and eat fruits\nand vegetables."

    "text": "The TÛR BETARK was a range of mountains in the eastern end of the Yellow\nMountains, that isolated Sirayn from the lands south. Its peaks rose\nsome 10,000 feet into the southern skies. Geography Few passes exist to\nprovide safe travel to southernmost Endor, only one known trade road\nbeing in use. The most notable promontory in the area, Ghabaras, the\nHorsehead’s Peak, is the highest in the local chain and possesses the\nrichest mines beneath its roots. In mineral composition, the Tûk Betark\nis similar to the rest of the range. Quartz, feldspar, and mica\npredominate in these ancient volcanic crags. The minerals cause the\nsummits to appear to glow in the dawn light. Sedimentary and\nmetarnorphic rocks may also be found in the northern and southern\nfoothills. Marble, slate, and gneiss form the boundaries between the\nvolcanic and sedimentary layers. Spectacular colors may be seen where\nthe rock faces are exposed. Moving north from the Tûr Betark to the\ndesert, the color of the soils and sands change from yellow to red. This\ngradation is caused by a change in the mineral content of the bedrock\nfrom yellow feldspar to red iron oxide. The Tûr Betark has the coolest\nclimate in Sirayn. Warm moist air from the Haragaer rises quickly and\ndrops rain on the southern slopes and uppermost peaks of the mountains,\nbountiously feeding the streams and rivers of the northern slopes.\nRainfall, although scant on the north side of the peaks, averages 75 to\n100 inches a year on the south side, and snow falk in every month on the\nhighest peaks. The climate of the Tûr Betark is a welcome change from\nthat of the desert. Temperatures in the upper vales rarely grow warmer\nthan 70 degrees in the summer. However, in the winter they seldom rise\nabove freezing. As in any mountainous area, the temperature at night is\nmuch colder than in the daytime. During especially cold years, ice may\nform on still water during even the summer months.  Flora and fauna\nDisplaying a true alpine environment, the flora and fauna of the Tûr\nBetark do not exhibit the water conservation traits of the other\nregions. The mountain vales display a profound variety of plants, from\nscrub oak and juniper in the foothills to tall majestic pines. Although\nthe flora is similar on the northem and southem slopes, the south\nreceives more rainfall, producing lusher ground cover. To the north,\nshort grasses cover the land between the tall pines and aspens. - Acaana\n- The plant that produces the flower used to create this poison may only\nbe found on the highest of peaks. The flower petals are made into a\ndeadly paste. - Megillos - The leaf of this small bush is used by the\nscouts of the Danak to increase the range of their vision. - Mirenna -\nMirenna berries mature in the summer in cool mountain vales. Harvested\nwhen ripe, the berries cure concussion damage. - Mook - The berries of a\ntree from the juniper family are collected and processed by the Danak.\nWhen ingested they act as an antidote for respiratory poisons. The Tûr\nBetark provides a very comfortable habitat for many animals. Ample rain\nand forage allow a large variety of herbivorous and camivorous species\nto co-exist. Rodents, sheep, goats, badgers, hedgehogs, and other\nnon-predators provide an abundant food supply for a stable population of\ncarnivores. Foxes, mountain lions, and hawks prune the extensive\nherbivorous species to manageable size. - Lautan - The lautan is a large\nrodent that lives throughout the Tûr Betark. Having short hair and ears,\nthe obnoxious animals are a bane to travellers in the mountains. They\neat through packs, spoil food, and generally make a nuisance of\nthemselves. Lautani are very stupid and extremely difficult to drive\noff. The Danak say that even hitting one of them on the head with a rock\nrarely affects their functioning. - Marnetta - These playful otter-like\ncreatures live in the foothills and forests of the Tûr Betark. Viewed as\na sign of good-luck by the Danak and the Sirani, they are rarely killed.\nLike otters, the marnetta (some are as big as large dogs) are extremely\nmischievous, although they pervade an air of pure innocence. - Tasidii -\nRelated to the Great Falcons of Mirkwood, the tasidii live only in the\nmost rernote areas of the Tûr Betark. Possessing twenty-five foot\nwingspans, they can serve as steeds to a skilled rider. Only magical\nmeans will effectively tie the loyalties of one of the fierce tasidii to\na human."

Known as a source (among\nothers) for the First Age character Túrin Turambar, Kullervo was the\ncenter of Tolkien's efforts in 1914, as he was “trying to turn one of\nthe stories — which is really a very great story and most tragic – into\na short story”. It was edited by Verlyn Flieger in 2010 and republished\nin August of 2015 by HarperCollins."

    "text": "TOLKIEN'S REQUIEM: CONCERNING BEREN AND LÚTHIEN (ISBN 9780592744543) is\na 74-page book written by John Carswell, the owner of the Tolkien-guide\nand podcast site TrueMyths.org. It serves as a basic introduction to\n_The Silmarillion_ and study of “Of Beren and Lúthien” - written in\n2014, and published in paperback by True Myths Press. Synopsis The\npurpose of the book is to introduce or reintroduce to J.R.R. Tolkien's\ntale of Beren and Lúthien, give exposition on the fundamental conflicts\nof the First Age that proceeded their time, and illuminate the\n“Tolkienian concepts” of escape, recovery, consolation, and\neucatastrophe. As the book's subtitle would not suggest, the first half\nchiefly concerns Morgoth and Ungoliant's destruction of the Two Trees of\nValinor and the deeds and flaws of Fëanor relating to the Silmarils.\nCarswell examines the many manifestations of evil and corrupted\nself-loves that take prominence in those tales, comparing Morgoth and\nUngoliant's motives for their causing destruction, Ungoliant to Gollum,\nFëanor to Morgoth, Morgoth to the Dragons of the Third Age, and Gorlim\nto the failure of Frodo at Mount Doom. Following this, the tale of Beren\nand Lúthien is studied. Carswell concludes towards at the end that the\nlove of Beren and Lúthien “puts right” the catastrophe of the\ndestruction of the Two Trees. Table of contents - Preface - A Brief\nIntroduction to Certain Names 1. The Seed of Middle-earth 2. Fëanor,\nMelkor, and the Tragedy of the Two Trees 3.

    "title": "Crist",
    "page_id": "44534",
    "text": "_'_Crist _'_is the name of a set of three 10th century Old English poems\nthat concern Jesus Christ, found in the Anglo-Saxon “Exeter Book”. The\nthree constituent poems have been simply named _Christ I_, ''Christ II\n''(which was known to be written by the poet Cynewulf), and _Christ\nIII_. They concern Christian topics such as Christ's advent and\nascension. Relevance The character Eärendil, who at the end of the First\nAge was responsible for the intervention of the Valar upon Morgoth and\nMorgoth's subsequent defeat, originated from a seeming revelation\nTolkien experienced in 1913 when he first read a particular line from\n_Christ II_: Eala éarendel engla beorhtast\nofer middangeard monnum sended In English, this is closest to meaning\n_Hail Earendel, brightest of angels, sent over middle-earth to mankind!_\nTolkien is cited to have said that upon reading this he “_...felt a\ncurious thrill as if something had stirred in me.....There was something\nvery remote and strange and beautiful behind those words, if I could\ngrasp it, far beyond the ancient English._” This moment and inspiration\nis noted by Tolkien scholars to have been important in the first shaping\nof the legendarium of Middle-earth as a mysterious philological\nrealization , or even in fact to have been the legendarium's first cause\n(since Eärendil was the first character to take shape). It prompted\nTolkien's writing of a poem initially entitled “The Voyage of Éarendel\nthe Evening Star”, of which he would write five successive versions ,\nstarting in September of 1914 . From the poem would stem _The Tale of\nEärendel_ which Tolkien later composed, also in multiple schemes and\nemendations, but never completed. This tale became the fifteenth of the\nposthumously published ''Lost Tales ''- and it was implied by its\nnarrator, the character Gilfanon, to be the great culmination of all\ntales that preceded it. _The Tale of Eärendel_ also evolved into the\nfinal climax of _Quenta Silmarillion_: the chapter “Of the Voyage of\nEärendil and the War of Wrath”, in which Eärendil indeed journeys across\nMiddle-earth to and from the West, seeking and then gaining the help of\nthe Valar, and carrying the morning star across the sky. Two ages after\nthis event, Frodo Baggins invoked Eärendil in two different instances -\ncalling him “brightest of stars” as the original poem suggested - in the\nQuenya outcries _Aiya Eärendil Elenion Ancalima!_ and _Aiya elenion\nancalima!_. The quoted line of Cynewulf from _Christ II_ also inspired\nTolkien's use of the very term “Middle-earth”."

    "page_id": "44674",
    "text": "Aside from being one name for Eldamar in Tolkien Mythology, ''FAËRIE\n_(or ''FAERIE_)''' '''is an archaic and scholarly term originating in\n1590 A.D. that can refer to “fairy-land” figuratively or in general, to\nfairies themselves from real-world folklore, or to a concept of\nfantastical storytelling. In J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium, the term does\nnot relate to Fays - instead it has borne much association to the Elves.\nRelevance As a location _Main article: Eldamar_ In the folklore of the\nHobbits, “Faerie” was the land of the Elves across the Sea. This\nreference can be seen in “Flies and Spiders”, the eighth chapter of _The\nHobbit_, and also in “Errantry” , a poem written by Bilbo Baggins. In\nreal-word mythology, “Faerie” had been the name of the realm of the\nfairy king in the Middle English tale _Sir Orfeo._ As a concept When\ndiscussing what today are referred to as “fairy-tales”, J.R.R. Tolkien\nonce wrote this explanation of his own use of the word: This usage of\n“Faerie” as a proper noun appears a total of forty times in “On\nFairy-Stories”. In the works of Tolkienian authors later on, this\nconnotation of “Faerie” is not often touched on. In 1997, Tolkien-editor\nVerlyn Flieger wrote the scholarly book, _A Question of Time: J.R.R.\nTolkien's Road to Faërie_. Like Tolkien's essay, it deals with the\nterm's contexts and meaning. When discussing Elves and their likeness to\nangels, Peter Kreeft cites Tolkien's statements that “Faërian Drama”,\nwhich the Elves frequently presented to Men, “produce Fantasy with a\nrealism and immediacy beyond the compass of any human mechanism”, and\nthat Fantasy “aspires” to the elvish craft, which is enchantment. Kreeft\nthen makes an imaginative point about Faërian Drama:"

History Before the foundation of\nArnor there was already a sizable Númenórean population living in\nEriador, a result of the slow emigration of Númenóreans which had\nstarted under Tar-Meneldur and Tar-Aldarion. The region was home to\nMiddle Men of Edain stock, and the early colonists soon interbred with\nthe indigenous population. Elendil and his people were aided by High\nKing of the Noldor Gil-galad and his people, and his ships sailed up the\nLune river. The North-kingdom of Arnor was founded by the High King of\nthe Dúnedain, Elendil and its chief city Dúnedain was originally meant\nto be the capital of the Númenórean Realms in Exile. The Dúnedain of\nthis land were ruled for centuries by the descendants of Elendil's\neldest son Isildur. After Isildur's death in TA 2, Arnor was ruled by\nhis direct descendants, beginning with his youngest surviving son,\nValandil. Before the end of the one-thousand years of the Third Age, the\nland of Arnor fell into dispute between the sons of King Eärendur.\nAfterwards the Dúnedain who lived there became divided into three\nrealms: Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur. One by one, these kingdoms fell\nto war, plague, and assaults by the evil-realm of Angmar and finally\nended in TA 1975 with the death of its last King Arvedui. The last of\nthe Dúnedain of Arnor had become a dwindled and wandering people known\nas the Rangers of the North. Nonetheless, the line of Isildur was\nmaintained through the Chieftain of the Rangers of the North. Aragorn II\nwas Isildur's Heir through thirty-nine generations, and it was he who\nreunited the Kingdoms of the Dúnedain after three thousand years of\nseparation."

History Early History Before the Downfall of\nNúmenor, the region that would become Gondor was home to many Númenórean\ncolonists, who either mingled with the indigenous Middle Men if they\nwere friendly, or dispersed them into Ras Morthil, Dunland, and Drúadan\nForest. The land on which Gondor was founded was more fertile than the\nmore northerly areas of Middle-earth, and so it already had a fairly\nlarge population and settlements, including a well-established haven,\nPelargir, founded by the Faithful Númenóreans in the year 2350 of the\nSecond Age. Exiles of Númenor The refugees from Númenor led by Isildur\nand Anárion were given a warm reception upon their arrival by those\nNúmenórean colonists. Those north of the river Anduin accepted Elendil\n's claim to kingship over them, being an heir of the Faithful Lords of\nAndúnie.

Melko deceives the Valar, telling the pillars he had made, merely\nof ice, were in fact indestructible. The lamps, lit by the liquid light\nin the sky, melt thesece pillars, and the Valar escape west in the\ndestruction of those lamps. Ulmo is sent to gather the spilled light\ninto two cauldrons named “Kulullin” and “Silindrin”. Two large pits hold\nthe two cauldrons, into which are put precious metals and gems, covered\nwith earth. Palurien, Vána the youthful, and Lórien “of Dreams” weave\nspells of power and life about the pits, and from them sprout two trees,\nof gold and silver: “Laurelin” and “Silpion” respectively. These great\nTrees give light, and all of Valinor is illuminated again. The Valar\nbuild their homes: Manwë atop the highest mountain, a place for Ossë\nwhen he grows weary of the waters, Lorien in great sleepy gardens,\nTulkas a place of laughter and feats of strength. Thus the Valar\nestablish the realm of Aman for their own. In the Cottage, one of the\nlisteners (proficient at his current occupation) wishes to be in the\nwarlike abode of Makar and his sister Meassë, but says he would be\nbetter off a guest of Oromë the hunter, to the amusement of the others.\nLindo the host calls it a night, and the group retires to sleep. Other\nmaterial Christopher Tolkien also outlines (without reproducing) an\nalternative story of the Lamps his father had written, the earliest\nversion of the creation of the Two Trees, a different account of the\nValar's mansions, and a complicated tale explaining the role of Mandos\n(named “Vefántur Mandos”) and the afterlife of Elves and Men. An early\npoem of J.R.R. Tolkien's named “Habbanan beneath the Stars” is also\nincluded; _Habbanan_ was the earliest conception of the land of Araman."

    "text": "The ATTACK OF THE ROHIRRIM was the short night-time battle between\nÉomer’s banished cavalry and the band of Isengard Uruk-hai and Orcs of\nMordor which had captured Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took border of\nFangorn Forest. The Rohirrim were victorious, and left no Orcs alive.\nUnbeknownst to them, Merry and Pippin were able to escape into the\nwoods. Background The Orc-host had recently attacked the Fellowship of\nthe Ring, killing Boromir of Gondor and capturing the hobbits Merry\nBrandybuck and Pippin Took. Among the Orc-host, there was some\ndisagreement on what to do with the hobbits: Uglúk and Grishnákh wanted\nto search them, while the Moria Orcs, called “Northerners,” wanted to\njust kill them. This disagreement slowed down their pace and allowed\nAragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, who were pursuing them, to gain on them. At\nthe same time, scouts sent ahead by the Orcs were seen by a Rohirrim\nscout, who alerted the Éored of Éomer that a large band of Orcs was\ncrossing the Eastemnet, headed for Isengard. Éomer, without official\nsanction from King Théoden, immediately headed for the Orcs. At this\npoint, Uglúk and Grishnákh were disagreeing over who would take the\nprisoners. The Isengarders overtook the Northerners and were joined by\naround 40 Mordor Orcs led by Grishnákh. The Battle As the combined\nIsengard-Mordor force overtook the Northerners, Grishnákh saw Éomer's\nforce riding quickly towards them. The orcs put on a new spurt of speed,\nhowever the riders had already hemmed them in, preventing them from\nscattering, and driving them along the banks of the river. The Rohirrim\nthen used a tactic of shooting stragglers and moving out of range of\nanswering bows, which they did many times before nightfall. This tactic\nkilled many orcs, and forced the others to run faster, thus tiring them\nout. During the night, the Orcs stopped on a hillock, but the horsemen\nhad surrounded them near Fangorn. Several orcs went off towards the\nforest, but only three returned. Uglúk put three Isengarders to guard\nthe hobbits, who were told to kill the captives only if the Rohirrim\nwere to break the circle. During their talk, several Rohirrim crawled\nover to the camp, killed several orcs, and vanished quickly. As\nGrishnákh tried to escape with Merry and Pippin, he was killed by a\nspear, which allowed Merry and Pippin to free themselves. As the Orcs\nrealized that they had lost the hobbits, a group of Isengarders led by\nMauhúr, which had come out of Fangorn, tried to break the Rohirrim's\nencirclement. The Rohirrim drew their circle close around the hillock to\nprevent a sortie, while a group rode off to attack the reinforcements.\nThe Orcs' reinforcements were soundly defeated, and so the riders\nreturned to their siege. At dawn, the riders charged from the East at\nthe Orcs, who shot all the arrows they had remaining. Although several\nhorsemen fell, the line held as they passed over the hill. They wheeled\naround and charged again. Most Orcs now fled helter-skelter and were\nkilled one by one. One band however, led by Uglúk, charged towards the\nforest, heading straight for the riders trying to contain them. They\ncharged up the slope, and killed three riders in their way. After\nwatching the battle unfold, Merry and Pippin escaped into Fangorn.\nUglúk, on the other hand, was overtaken by Éomer, who dismounted and\nfought him sword to sword. All the orcs who could still escape were run\ndown and slaughtered by the riders. Aftermath The Riders built a mound\nfor their 15 fallen comrades, sung their praises, and set an equal\nnumber of spears around it. They then burned the piled carcasses of the\nOrcs and scattered their ashes. Pippin and Merry were met by Treebeard\nin Fangorn. Two days later, Éomer's Éored encountered Aragorn, Legolas,\nand Gimli, who he told of the battle. He gave to them two horses whose\nmasters had fallen in the battle, Hasufel to Aragorn and Arod to\nLegolas. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli later traced the Hobbits' steps\ninto Fangorn, and there met Gandalf.",

    "text": "GONDOR SINDARIN was a dialect of the Elven language spoken by the Men of\nGondor. Differences Westron was the first language of Gondor. The\nnobility usually learned Sindarin, and used it to be polite to other\nnobles and strangers alike. Because it was both an acquired and a\nlearned language, it had some notable differences with “regular” Third\nAge Sindarin. Phonetical Like any acquired language, the second\nlanguage's sound range is directly influenced by the speaker's original\nsound range. Westron did not possess _ch_ or _y_, and pronounced them\ndifferently. “Y” The _y_ was pronounced by Sindarin Elves as IPA , a\nclose front rounded vowel. Of all languages, only Sindarin had this\nsound, so it was problematic for speakers of other tongues. Gondorians\ngenerally pronounced it as an _i_, though it was sometimes substituted\nwith an _e_, as in the Gondorian plural for _onod_, _ened_ (rather than\nthe usual _enyd_). “CH” Also frequent in Sindarin was the _ch_, the\nvelar fricative, which the Gondorians also encountered among\npre-Númenórean placenames such as Erech and Eilenach. The most notable\nuse of the voiceless velar fricative was in the name of Gondor's new\nnorthern neighbour, Rohan. Originally envisioned as _Rochand_, in Gondor\nthis became _Rohan_. Though the tongue of the Éothéod did possess the\nvoiced _ch_, it adopted the southern use. The voiced velar fricative,\nwhich is found in _Rochand_, was pronounced as a sounded _h_, while the\nvoiceless variant, at the end of words, was pronounced as a _k_. Those\nvery learned would pronounce them correct, but forcibly so. Philological\nAnother notable difference from regular Sindarin was purely\nphilological. Those Gondorians learned in lore wished to speak like\nNoldor, and the Sindarin they spoke in the First Age was North Sindarin.\nAt least one feature from North Sindarin was reintroduced: whereas “true\nSindarin of the Elves” changed both the voiced and voiceless combination\nof a sonorant consonant and a spirant to a long sonorant, the Gondor\nSindarin retained the spirant. Thus in the case of the former, _malt_\n(“gold”) and _orn_ (“tree”) became _Mallorn_, in Gondor this remained\n_Malthorn_."

The Earliest\nSettlements The Dwarves of Durin's folk considered the Ered Mithrin as\npart of their land as far back as the reign of Durin I. Throughout the\nFirst and Second Age, the Grey Mountains had been mined and inhabited by\nDwarves of Durin's Folk. The Awakening of Durin's Bane Durin's folk\nstarted to gather in the Grey Mountains in TA 1981 after a Balrog was\nawakened in their ancestral home of Khazad-dûm, which its people fled in\nfear. Another portion of Durin's folk lead by King Thráin I established\nthe Kingdom under the Mountain at Erebor. Some years after leaving Moria\nScatha, the Great Worm of the Ered Mithrin began to afflict the Dwarves\nand all who lived in that region, until Fram of the Éothéod slew him,\nbringing peace from the Long-Worms from many years till the War of the\nDwarves and Dragons. But there was a feud between the Dwarves and Fram,\nfor he refused to yield any of the treasure of Scatha to the Dwarves.\nInstead he sent a necklace of Scatha's teeth to them, saying “treasures\nlike these are hard to come by”. For this insult it is said the Dwarves\nslew him. The Seat of Durin's Realm In TA 2210 King Thorin I, learning\nthat most of his people were gathering in the Grey Mountains, left the\nLonely Mountain to join the Dwarves to the north, for those mountains\nwere rich and little explored. The War of the Dwarves and Dragons For\nmany years Durin's folk prospered in the Ered Mithrin, but the Dragons\nin the wastes beyond began to multiply again and made war on the Dwarves\nin TA 2570, and plundered their works. After 19 years the War of the\nDwarves and Dragons came to an end when a great Cold-drake killed King\nDáin I, and his second son Frór at the door of his hall. A year later\nmost of Durin's folk abandoned the Grey Mountains. Grór, youngest son of\nthe king went with many followers to the Iron Hills.

Working whatever mines they\ncould hold from the Orcs and Dragons, but is speculated that they may\nhave left at some point as well. It is likely that the Dwarves reclaimed\nall their old halls and mines sometime during the Fourth Age, if not\nafter Dáin II Ironfoot became king of Durin's folk in the late Third\nAge."

    "title": "Great Tales",
    "page_id": "45987",
    "text": "The GREAT TALES made up the most important tales of the First Age. All\nof them are covered within _The History of Middle-earth_, but recently,\nlone publications of some of them have been made, in the same manner as\n_The Children of Húrin_ in 2007. Publications and chapters - _The\nChildren of Húrin_ (2007) - _Beren and Lúthien_ (2017) - _The Fall of\nGondolin_ (2018) - _The Tale of Eärendel_ (a chapter is included with\n_The Fall of Gondolin_ publication, and _The Book of Lost Tales Part\nTwo_.) Background _The Fall of Gondolin_, “...together with _Beren and\nLúthien_ and _The Children of Húrin_, he regarded it as one of the three\n‘Great Tales’ of the Elder Days.” Tolkien also referred to the 'four\ngreat tales' as the _Great Saga_ or _The Lays of the Children of Atani_.\nHe originally envisioned writing several stories from the entire _Quenta\nSilmarillion_ as full, standalone stories. “I would draw some of the\ngreat tales in fullness, and leave many only placed in the scheme, and\nsketched.” Christopher Tolkien states in the forward to _The Children of\nHúrin_: It is seen from this reminiscence that from far back it was a\npart of his conception of what came to be called _The Silmarillion_ that\nsome of the ‘Tales’ should be told in much fuller form; and indeed in\nthat same letter of 1951 he referred expressly to the three stories\nwhich I have mentioned above as being much the longest in _The Book of\nLost Tales_. Here he called the tale of _Beren and Lúthien_ ‘the chief\nof the stories of _The Silmarillion_’, and of it he said: ‘the story is\n(I think a beautiful and powerful) heroic-fairy-romance, receivable in\nitself with only a very general vague knowledge of the background. But\nit is also a fundamental link in the cycle, deprived of its full\nsignificance out of its place therein.’ ‘There are other stories almost\nequally full in treatment,’ he went on, ‘and equally independent, and\nyet linked to the general history’: these are _The Children of Húrin_\nand _The Fall of Gondolin_.   It thus seems unquestionable, from my\nfather’s own words, that if he could achieve final and finished\nnarratives on the scale he desired, he saw the three ‘Great Tales’ of\nthe Elder Days (_Beren and Lúthien_, the _Children of Húrin_, and the\n_Fall of Gondolin_) as works sufficiently complete in themselves as not\nto demand knowledge of the great body of legend known as _The\nSilmarillion_. Christopher also stated in the _The War of the Jewels_:\nThe completion of the _Quenta Silmarillion_ remained an aim; but the\n'great tales', vastly developed from their original forms, from which\nits later chapters should be derived were never achieved. Other Great\nTales Tolkien has used the term 'great tale' to refer to other works in\nhis legendarium as well. For example in _Letters 131_ (quote mentioned\nabove) which Tolkien refers to all of the stories in the _Quenta\nSilmarillion_ as 'great tales', he also discusses _Lord of the Rings_ as\nbeing the last 'great Tale': But as the earliest Tales are seen through\nElvish eyes, as it were, this last great Tale, coming down from myth and\nlegend to the earth, is seen mainly though the eyes of Hobbits: it thus\nbecomes in fact anthropocentric. Sam makes reference to this in _The\nReturn of the King_ when he states (when comparing their own story to\nBeren and Lúthien's tale): “Why, to think of it, we’re in the same tale\nstill! It’s going on. Don’t the great tales never end?” One of the\nearliest references to the term 'great tale' is included in the “The\nCottage of Lost Play” in _The Book of Lost Tales_: Now it happened on a\ncertain time that a traveller from far countries, a man of great\ncuriosity, was by desire of strange lands and the ways and dwellings of\nunaccustomed folk brought in a ship as far west even as the Lonely\nIsland, Tol Eressëa in the fairy speech, but which the Gnomes1 call Dor\nFaidwen, the Land of Release, and a great tale hangs thereto. The _Book\nof Lost Tales_ makes several other references to 'great tales' as well\nThe chapter _The Hiding of Valinor_ is also called a 'great tale': And\nthus ended Vairë, and the great tale fell silent in the room. In _The\nTale of Tinúviel_ Beren uses flattery towards Melko (Morgoth) by\nstating: Many a great tale has my father made to me aforetime of thy\nsplendour and glory, wherefore, albeit I am no renegade thrall, I do\ndesire nothing so much as to serve thee in what small manner I may...\nOne of the earliest references to the Fall of Gondolin being a 'great\ntale': Yet now those exiles of Gondolin dwelt at the mouth of Sirion by\nthe waves of the Great Sea. There they take the name of Lothlim, the\npeople of the flower, for Gondothlim is a name too sore to their hearts;\nand fair among the Lothlim Eärendel grows in the house of his father,\nand the great tale of Tuor is come to its waning. Finally, the\nreferences to the unwritten _Tale of Eärendel_ in the chapter _The Fall\nof Gondolin_ which includes _Tuor and the Exiles of Gondolin (which\nbringeth in the great tale of Eärendel)_: And thus did all the fates of\nthe fairies weave then to one strand, and that strand is the great tale\nof Eärendel; and to that tale’s true beginning are we now come."

    "text": "The DWARVES OF THE IRON HILLS were Dwarves belonging to the house of the\nLongbeards, otherwise known as Durin's Folk, who lived in the Iron\nHills. History Early history The Longbeard Dwarves of Khazad-dûm\ncolonized the Iron Hills in the First Age. The Hills were their primary\nsource of iron-ore. The Dwarf-road of Mirkwood ran north-east from\nKhazad-dûm to the Hills for use by dwarf-traders and merchants. After\nSauron destroyed Eregion in the Second Age, the Longbeards sealed\nKhazad-dûm and Orcs took control of the northern Misty Mountains and the\nGrey Mountains. This ended communication between the Iron Hills and\nKhazad-dûm for some time. Third Age Founding of Grór's Realm In the\nThird Age, many Longboard Dwarves lived in the Grey Mountains, but they\nwere greatly troubled by Dragons in that region. After King Dáin I was\nslain by one of these dragons, his surviving sons led an exodus into the\neast. Dáin's elder son Thrór recreated the Kingdom under the Mountain at\nErebor, while his younger brother Grór led a part of the people further\ninto the east to join their kindred living in the Iron Hills. Grór\nsettled in the Iron Hills in the year TA 2590 and became Lord of the\nIron Hills. During his reign, the realm became the strongest in the\nNorth, being the only realm standing between Sauron and his plans to\ndestroy Rivendell and taking back the lands of Angmar. Also, following\nthe Sack of Erebor many of Durin's folk fleeing from Smaug and those\nwandering in exile, except for Thrór and his small company of family and\nfollowers, came to the Iron Hills, bolstering their numbers. War of the\nDwarves and Orcs During the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, many Dwarves\nfrom the Iron Hills fought several battles, but they are mostly\nremembered from the Battle of Azanulbizar in the year TA 2799. Naín and\nhis army came to the battle in the most crucial moment when the main\nDwarven army was being decimated by the great host of Orcs. With these\nfresh reinforcements, the Dwarves were able to route and destroy their\nopponents, fighting their way all up to the steps of the East-gate of\nMoria. There, Nain dueled with Azog, the Orc commander, resulting in his\ndeath. Later in the battle, Dáin II Ironfoot killed Azog out of\nvengeance for his father, achieving recognition because he was very\nyoung by dwarven standards. After this battle, Dain led his Dwarves back\nto Grór's Halls. Dáin's Reign Grór ruled the Dwarves of the Iron Hills\nfor 215 years, and he died in TA 2805 at 241 years of age. Dáin Ironfoot\nbecame the next Lord of the Iron Hills. During his reign, the Iron Hills\nevolved to the mightiest Dwarf-realm of its time. Years later, Dáin's\ncousin Thorin attempted to restore the kingdom at Erebor, but he was\ntrapped by the Elves of Mirkwood and Northmen of Esgaroth and sent to\nthe Iron Hills for aid. Dáin arrived with over 500 armored Dwarves and\nas events developed, the Dwarves of the Iron Hills proved crucial in\nwinning the ensuing Battle of Five Armies against the Orcs of the Misty\nMountains. Thorin died in that battle, and with him the royal line of\nThrór. Through his ancestor Grór, the Kingship of Durin's Folk then fell\non Dáin. Dáin II Ironfoot removed from the Iron Hills and re-established\na kingdom under the Lonely Mountain. It is possible that both Iron Hills\nand Erebor were ruled by him and later by his son Thorin III Stonehelm.\nThe Dwarves of the Iron Hills fought alongside the Dwarves of Erebor in\nthe Battle of Dale against the Easterlings during the War of the Ring.\nOther information They became well-known for making a metal mesh that\ncould be used for making flexible items like leg-coverings. These\nDwarves of Durin's folk were known for being some of the most fierce and\nelite of all Dwarf armies capable of matching Sauron's army on equal\nfooting. Their main weapon of choice seemed to have been the mattocks,\nthough they also carried a short broad sword with a round shield. Not\nmuch is said on whom were enemies of these dwarves, but it seems likely\nthat the Easterlings were one of them since their empire was near and\naround the Iron Hills, and possibly the Dragons that lived nearby in the\nnorthern wastes.",

    "text": "THE FALL OF GONDOLIN is an upcoming stand-alone publication of the third\npart of the Great Tales, and follow-up to _The Children of Hurin_ (2007)\nand _Beren and Lúthien_ (2017). It also contains a chapter concerning\nthe last of the “Great Tales”: _The Tale of Eärendel_. From the\npublisher Canon _The Fall of Gondolin_ is the third of the Great Tales,\nbut was the first written by Tolkien, and is the second most complete of\nthe tales (after The Children of Húrin, and is less fractured than the\nmaterials used to make up Beren and Lúthien (2017) as stand alone and\n'continuous' as possible). The sources that cover this major First Age\nevent are the chapters _The Fall of Gondolin_ of ''The Book of Lost\nTales Part Two __ ''and _Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin_ in _The\nSilmarillion_, which both tell of the founding of the Elven city of\nGondolin (built in secret by Turgon and his people), of the arrival\nTuor, a prince of the Edain, of the betrayal of the city to Morgoth by\nTurgon's nephew Maeglin, and of its subsequent destruction by Morgoth's\narmies. There is also a unfinished (consisting of around 130 lines) and\nunpublished poem: _The Lay of the Fall of Gondolin._ Sections of _Of\nMaeglin_, and name list in _Parma Eldalamberon volume 15_. The _Lost\nTales_ chapter goes more in depth than the account in _The\nSilmarillion_, telling notably in detail of Tuor's and Ecthelion's feats\nin battle, and mentioning every captain of the Houses of the\nGondolindrim. Background J.R.R. Tolkien actually began writing the story\nthat would become “The Fall of Gondolin” in 1917, in an army barracks on\nthe back of a sheet of military marching music. It is more or less the\nfirst traceable story he ever wrote down on paper about the Middle-earth\nlegendarium. Because Tolkien was constantly revising his First Age\nstories, the narrative he wrote in 1917 (published posthumously in _The\nBook of Lost Tales Part Two_) remains the only full account of the fall\nof the city. The narrative in _The Silmarillion_ was the result of the\nediting by his son Christopher of various different sources. A partial\nnew version of “The Fall of Gondolin” was published in the _Unfinished\nTales_ under the title “Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin”. Actually\ntitled “Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin”, this narrative shows a great\nexpansion of the earlier tale. It can be surmised from this text that\nTolkien would have rewritten the entire story, but for reasons that are\nnot known he abandoned the text before Tuor actually arrives in the\ncity. For this reason Christopher Tolkien retitled the story before\nincluding it in _Unfinished Tales_."

This family of Númenóreans were\nakin to the Lords of Andúnië and thus related to Elendil. When Elendil\nhimself came to Middle-earth and founded the Kingdoms of the Dúnedain,\nhe granted this family a noble title, making them the hereditary Princes\nof Belfalas. We have few details of the history of the Princes, though\nat one time they were powerful enough to give their name to the region\nwhere they lived: Dor-en-Ernil, the Land of the Prince. The line had\ndefinitely come to a formal end by TA 2076, having lasted for more than\ntwo millennia, when Galador son of Imrazôr became the first Prince of\nDol Amroth. This new style continued in use to the end of the Third Age\nand beyond. Though there were no further Princes of Belfalas after\nGalador's time, they remained important in history. In particular, we\nknow that one branch of their descendants removed to Lossarnach. Morwen\nSteelsheen, a daughter of that family, married Thengel of Rohan.

They had generally better\nrelations with the Elves than their neighbors in Nogrod, and were behind\nthe building of Menegroth. The Dwarves of Belegost were friends to the\nSindar and later allies of the Noldor of Beleriand. They first met the\nNoldor Elves near Mount Rerir and a great friendship began between the\ntwo peoples; Maedhros once saved Lord Azaghâl from an Orc-assault.

When the Dwarves of Nogrod assembled a\ngreat host of Dwarves to attack Doriath, the Dwarves of Belegost tried\nto dissuade them from war, but their brethren from Nogrod did not heed\ntheir advice. These Dwarves went on to fight in the Battle of the\nThousand Caves, and later met their demise the Battle of Sarn Athrad.\nAfter this tragedy the Dwarves of Belegost started leaving for\nKhazad-dûm, for fear of reprisal from the Elves. There was much loathing\nbetween Elf and Dwarf from there on. Belegost was later ruined in the\nWar of Wrath, and most of the dwarves left for Khazad-dûm. Some stayed\nto build, or rebuild, new homes and mines, along with the remaining\nDwarves of Nogrod. In smithing, the Dwarves of Belegost were second only\nto the Dwarves of Nogrod. They learned many secrets in smithing from the\nElves, and Elves from them.

History Kingdom Thráin I established the Kingdom under the\nMountain fleeing from Moria. During his time the Arkenstone was\ndiscovered, the most prized possession of the Kingdom. His son, Thorin\nI, later became King under the Mountain but after seeing the wealth of\nthe Dwarves of the Grey Mountains, he abandoned Erebor. When the\nCold-drakes invaded the Grey Mountains, they drove most of the Dwarves\nout. Thrór, a descendant of Thorin I, took some of his people and flew\nthe Grey Mountains for Erebor. His brother Grór continued east with a\ngreat following of Durin's folk to the Iron Hills while himself\nrefounded the kingdom of Erebor in TA 2590. Second Kingdom The Dwarves\ngained the friendship of the Northmen along the Celduin and had much\ntrade of goods, beautiful trinkets, and weapons with the town of Dale.\nThe Dwarves of Erebor also had much traffic of ores with their kinsmen\nin the Iron Hills and the region had peace and prosperity for many\nyears. The Dwarves were properous, and made great wealth for themselves\nuntil they were dispossessed of their immense wealth by Smaug the\nDragon, who flew south from the Ered Mithrin and sacked their kingdom in\nTA 2770. The Dwarves reclaimed their inheritance many years later under\nthe leadership of Thorin II. But it was the descendants of Dáin II\nIronfoot that ruled there ever after. Third Kingdom After the\nrestoration thanks to Thorin and Company, the Dwarves became again rich\nand prosperous under Dáin's rule, as the Dwarves exceeded their\nancestors in masonry and mining. Dale was rebuilt as a kingdom and they\nhad a close friendship with the Elves of Mirkwood. Balin and other\nDwarves set out to reclaim Moria in TA 2989. Dáin did not give his\nblessing when Balin, but could not dissuade them. It was only later\nlearned the colony was destroyed after five years. War of the Ring In TA\n3018, a messenger came from Mordor, enquiring about “Baggins” from\n“Shire”, promising the last three Dwarf-rings to Dáin. The King asked\ntime to think and he sent Glóin and his son Gimli to Elrond for council,\nand to warn Bilbo. The War of the Ring reached the North; King Brand\nfighting the Easterlings retreated from the River Carnen and was given\naid by Dwarves in the Battle of Dale. After three days of fighting\nDwarves and Men were driven back, and Brand was slain, followed by Dáin.\nSeveral days later the Easterlings learned that the War was lost. When\nthe new King Thorin III Stonehelm, son of Dáin, and Brand's Bard II saw\nthis they came out of the mountain and routed their enemies. Little is\nknown of the reign of Thorin III, other than the Dwarves helped rebuild\nthe cities of Minas Tirith and the fortress of Helm's Deep. Some of the\nDwarves colonized the Glittering Caves. Language and writing The Dwarves\nof Erebor spoke Khuzdul but used the Language of Dale for their public\nnames. Coming from Moria, the Dwarves brought with them the Angerthas\nMoria, which however was modified further. For some reason some runes of\nAngerthas Moria were reverted back to their Elvish values in Angerthas.\nThe resulting variation was known as Angerthas Erebor.

During the\nFirst Age he was lord of the Falas, a shoreland region in which stood\ntwo great havens, Brithombar and Eglarest. After the defeat of the Elves\nin the great battle of the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, the forces of Morgoth\nbroke down the walls of Círdan's Havens and laid them in ruin. Círdan\nhimself escaped the destruction aboard a ship, in which he sailed to the\nIsle of Balar and created a new haven and refuge far from Morgoth's\nravaging armies. Thus Círdan had been a lord of Havens back into the\nhistory of Middle-earth, but the title 'Lord of the Havens' is only used\nafter the beginning of the Second Age, when he served High King\nGil-galad as the Master of the Grey Havens. These Grey Havens, or\nMithlond in Elvish, were founded on the new western coasts of\nMiddle-earth in Lindon, after the Sea had claimed most of the lands\nwestward of the Blue Mountains. From there Círdan oversaw the making of\nthe ships that would sail out into the Great Sea and on to Aman in the\nUttermost West. The importance of Círdan as Lord of the Havens is shown\nby the fact that he bore, for a time, one of the Three Rings of the\nElves. When Celebrimbor sent two of the Rings north to Gil-galad for\nsafekeeping, Gil-galad passed one of them, Narya the Ring of Fire, to\nCírdan. Círdan passed it on in turn, for he was at the Grey Havens when\nthe Wizards sailed into harbour. He chose to grant the Ring to one among\nthem - the one later named Mithrandir or Gandalf - as an aid in his work\nin Middle-earth. The Grey Havens had been founded at the very beginning\nof the Second Age, and still stood at the end of the Third. Círdan had\nbeen their Lord for all this time; as he watched the White Ship carry\nthe Ring-bearers out from his harbour, he had held the Lordship of the\nHavens for a period of nearly six and a half millennia. At some point in\nthe Fourth Age, it seems, Círdan finally boarded the Last Ship to sail\nfrom Mithlond, and passed from Middle-earth after thousands of years as\nLord of the Havens."

These two houses built the great Dwarven\ncities of Nogrod and Belegost in the Blue Mountains. It is not clear\nwhether they shared the two cities or whether each house dwelt in its\nown.
