    "text": "TELERIN, also called LINDALAMBË or LINDÁRIN (“tongue of the Lindar”),\nwas the language of the Falmari. It was mainly spoken in Valinor, but\nthe speakers of Telerin outnumbered in whole Aman the speakers of\nQuenya, much as did the Teleri outnumber the Vanyar and Noldor.\n\nSometimes Telerin was been considered a dialect of Quenya, but the\nTeleri themselves considered it to be an independent language. In the\nbroadest sense, _Telerin_ refers to any tongue of Elves that were of\nLindar origin.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of speakers of Quenya, Telerin was a closely related\nlanguage still largely intelligible. However, the phonology of the two\nlanguages differed much, with Telerin often being more conservative than\nQuenya.\n\nFinarfin is said to have learned Telerin. He also gave his sons\nTelerin-influenced Quenya names.\n\nThe coexistence with the Teleri, made the Noldor to differientate\nthemselves from the speech of the Vanyar. For example the Vanyar\npronounced /f/ very soft, almost like /hw/, but the Noldor resisted this\nchange through influence from the Teleri.\n\nAlso, the Teleri prized silver above gold, and their skill as\nsilversmiths was esteemed even by the Noldor who seemed to prefer the\nTelerin word _telpe_ “silver” intead the Quenya form _tyelpë_."

    "lotr_page_id": "30781",
    "text": "ENTISH is the unifying and most common language of the Ents, a race of\ntree-like spirits created by the Valar Yavanna. Their language appears\nto be based on an ancient form of Common Eldarin, later enriched by\nQuenya and Sindarin, although it includes many unique 'tree-ish'\nadditions.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOld Entish\n\nOriginally, the Ents had a language of their own, described as long and\nsonorous. Only Ents spoke Old Entish; not because they kept their\nlanguage a secret, as the Dwarves did with Khuzdul, but because no other\ncould master it. It was quite an alien language to all others. The\nHuorns and trees of Fangorn forest could understand Old Entish and\nconverse with the Ents and each other with it. The only extant sample,\na-lalla-lalla-rumba-kamanda-lindor-burúme, the word for hill (or\npossibly even just part of the name of a specific hill), was described\nas a very inaccurate sampling. Even the Elves, master linguists, could\nnot learn Old Entish, nor did they attempt to record it due to its\ncomplex sound structure. The grammar structure of Old Entish was also\nquite bizarre, often described as a lengthy, long-winded discussion of a\ntopic. There may not even have been a word for yes and no: such\nquestions would be answered by a long monologue on why the Ent in\nquestion did or did not agree with the Ent who asked the question. Ents\nas a rule would say nothing in Old Entish unless it was worth taking a\nlong time to say. For everyday language function, they usually resorted\nto “New” Entish.\n\nNew Entish\n\nDue to contact with the Elves, the Ents learned much from them. The Ents\nfound the Elvish language Quenya to be a lovely language, and adapted it\nafter their fashion to everyday use. However, they basically adapted\nQuenya vocabulary to Old Entish grammatical structure. Thus, unlike Old\nEntish, the individual words of “New Entish” that characters such as\nTreebeard spoke were easily translatable.\n\n\nWords and Translations\n\nMost of the Entish words and vowels are almost entirely based on Quenya\nand Sindarin, the two most common languages spoken by the Elves."

Celeborn's native tongue was originally\nLemberin, but was later changed to Telerin.\n"

    "lotr_page_id": "160",
    "text": "SINDARIN was the Elvish language most commonly spoken in Middle-earth\nduring in the Third Age - in the real world it is universally referred\nto as, when not in canonical context, “ELVEN” or “ELVISH”.\n\nThe written alphabet of Sindarin, as with Quenya, is typically Tengwar\n(the Feanorian Characters), although Cirth (Runes) can also be used.\n\n\nHistory\n\n It was the language of the Sindar,\nthose Teleri who chose to stay behind on the Great Journey of the Elves.\nIt was derived from an earlier language called “Common Telerin”. When\nthe Ñoldor came back to Middle-earth, they adopted the Sindarin\nlanguage, for the Sindar were more numerous and slower to learn the\nlanguage of Valinor, Quenya the Noldor's native language. Later events\nled to the banning of the use of Quenya within and around Beleriand\nleading to it's eventual use as a high language of law. Before the\ndownfall, most of the Men of Númenor also spoke the language. Knowledge\nof it was kept in the Númenorean realm in exile Gondor, especially among\nthe learned. Dwarves, notably Durin's Folk, used Sindarin when\ncommunicating with Elves. Sindarin is the language referred to as _the\nElven-tongue_ in _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\nTolkien originally imagined that the language which would become\n_Sindarin_ was spoken by the Ñoldor (second clan of Elves). However he\nlater decided that it was the language of the Sindar. For this reason it\nis called _Noldorin_ in the older material, such as the Etymologies.\nWhen Noldorin became Sindarin, it also adopted some features of the\noriginally unrelated language _Ilkorin_. Tolkien based the sound and\nsome of the grammar of his Noldorin/Sindarin on Welsh, and Sindarin\ndisplays of the consonant mutations that characterise the Celtic\n(especially Brythonic) languages. The language was also probably\ninfluenced to an extent by the Germanic languages, as Tolkien was a\nscholar of both Old English and Old Norse.\n\n\nGrammar\n\nSindarin is mainly analytic, though traits of its highly inflected\nprogenitor can still be seen.\n\nPhonology\n\nSindarin was designed to have a Welsh-like phonology. It has most of the\nsame sounds and similar phonotactics.\n\n  -------- ----- -------------------------------------------------------------\n  LETTER   IPA   NOTES\n  a              \n  b              \n  c              \n  ch             The “ch” in the German word “Buch”, not as in “church”\n  d              \n  dh             The “th” in “heather”\n  e              \n  f              Represents  when final or before n,  everywhere else.\n  g              \n  h              \n  hw             \n  i              Represents  when initial,  everywhere else.\n  l              \n  lh       ɬ     The same as the Welsh LL.\n  m              \n  n              \n  ng             Represents  when final,  everywhere else.\n  o              \n  p              \n  ph             Represents  when final,  everywhere else.\n  r              \n  rh             \n  s              \n  t              \n  th             The “th” in “heath”\n  u              \n  v              \n  w              \n  y              Pronounced like German _ü_\n  -------- ----- -------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn accent signifies a long vowel (á, é, etc.). In a monosyllabic word, a\ncircumflex is used (â, ê, etc.). However, for practical reasons, users\nof the ISO Latin-1 character set often substitute ý for ŷ.\n\nDiphthongs are _ai_ (pronounced like AIsle), _ei_ (dAY), _ui_ (tOO\nYoung), _au_ (cOW), and _oi_ (bOY). If the last diphthong finishes a\nword, it is spelt _aw_. There are also diphthongs _ae_ and _oe_ with no\nEnglish counterparts; Tolkien recommended to substitute _ai_ and _oi_\nrespectively if one does not care about details. If one does care, it is\nsimilar to pronouncing _a_ or _o_ respectively in the same syllable as\none pronounces an _e_ (as in pEt).\n\nIn archaic Sindarin, there was a vowel similar to German _ö_ (IPA: ),\nwhich Tolkien mostly transcribed as _œ_ (usually _not_ as _oe_ as is\noften found in publications like the Silmarillion, cf. _Nirnaeth\nArnoediad_ , _Goelydh_ ).\nThis vowel later came to be pronounced and is therefore transcribed as\nsuch .\n\nArchaic Sindarin also had a spirant _m_ or nasal _v_ (IPA: ), which was\ntranscribed as _mh_ (though always pronounced in later Sindarin).\n\nNouns\n\nPluralization\n\nSindarin plurals are characterised by _i-affection_, or _umlaut_. The\nSindarin term for this is _prestanneth_ (disturbance, affection). Almost\nall Sindarin words form their plurals like English man/men and\ngoose/geese — by changing the vowels in the word. The plural patterns\nare:\n\n-   In non-final syllables:\n    -   a > e — galadh > gelaidh\n    -   e > e — bereth > berith\n    -   i > i — dineth > dinith\n    -   o > e — gowest > gewist\n    -   u > y — tulus > tylys\n    -   y > y — (no example available)\n-   In final syllables:\n    -   a > ai — anar > enair\n    -   â > ai — tâl > tail\n    -   e > i — adaneth > edenith\n    -   ê > î — hên > hîn\n    -   i > i — brennil > brennil\n    -   î > î — dîs > dîs\n    -   o > y — brannon > brennyn\n    -   ó > ý — bór > býr\n    -   ô > ý — thôn > thýn\n    -   u > y — urug > yryg\n    -   û > ui — hû > hui\n    -   y > y — ylf > ylf\n    -   ý > ý — mýl > mýl\n    -   au > oe — naug > noeg\n\nNote that _ai_ can sometimes become _î_ (or, less commonly, _ý_).\n\nThe reason for this is that the primitive plural ending _-î_ (still\npresent in Quenya as _-i_) affected the vowels in the word by making\nthem higher and fronter. After this sound change occurred, the suffix\n_-î_ disappeared when all final vowels were lost.\n\nClass Plural\n\nSindarin also has several suffixes which denote a so-called class\nplural. For example, _-ath_ indicates a group of something, e. g.\n_elenath_ from elen (an archaic form of _êl_), meaning _star_ and\n_-ath_. It means _a group of stars_ or _all the stars in the sky_.\nAnother ending, _-rim_, is used to indicate a race, e. g. _nogothrim_\nfrom _nogoth_ — _dwarf_ and _-rim_, meaning _the race of dwarves_. The\nending _-hoth_ is generally used in an unfriendly sense, e. g.\n_gaurhoth_ from _gaur_ — _werewolf_ and _-hoth_, meaning\n_werewolf-host_.\n\nMutation\n\nSindarin has a complex series of mutations. There are three main\ndifferent types of mutations: _soft mutation_ (or lenition), _nasal\nmutation_ and _stop_ (occlusive) _mutation_. Additionally, a _mixed\nmutation_ is also observed after certain particles or prepositions.\nFinally, it is presumed that Sindarin also once had what we could call\nan _archaic spirantal mutation_ (also sometimes called _liquid mutation_\nby scholars). It is still uncertain whether this mutation is still\nproductive or if it only occurs in ancient constructs.\n\nInitial mutations must not be confused with assimilations that may occur\nin compound words (such as, for instance, in the names _Araphor_,\n_Arassuil_ and _Caradhras_).\n\nThe following table outlines how different consonants are affected by\nthe different mutations.\n\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n  BASIC   SOFT   NASAL   MIXED   STOP   LIQUID\n  b       v      m       b       b      v\n  c       g      ch      g       ch     ch\n  d       dh     n       d       d      dh\n  g       '      ng      g       g      '\n  h       ch     ch      h       ch     ch\n  lh      thl    'l      'l      thl    'l\n  m       v      m       m       m      v\n  p       b      ph      b       b      ph\n  rh      thr    'r      'r      thr    'r\n  s       s      s       h       s      s\n  t       d      th      d       th     th\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n\nHere the apostrophe indicates elision.\n\nWords beginning in _b-_, _d-_, or _g-_ which descend from older _mb-_,\n_nd-_, or _ng-_ are affected differently by the mutations:\n\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n  BASIC   SOFT   NASAL   MIXED   STOP   LIQUID\n  b       m      mb      mb      mb     b\n  d       n      nd      nd      nd     d\n  g       ng     g       g       g      g\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n\nTake, for example, the deictic article _i_, which triggers soft\nmutation. When added to a word like _tâl_, it becomes _i dâl_. In\nSindarin's phonological history, _t_ became _d_ in the middle of a word.\nBecause _i tâl_ at the time was considered one word, the _t_ became _d_,\nand thus _i dâl_. However, without the article the word is still _tâl_.\n\nMutation is triggered in various ways:\n\n-   Soft mutation, the most widely occurring mutation, is triggered by\n    the singular article _i_, the prefixes _athra-, ath-, go-, gwa-,\n    ú-,_ and _u-_, as well as the prepositions _ab, am, adel, be, dad,\n    di, na, nu,_ and _î_, and after _avo_. It also affects the second\n    element in a compound, an adjective following a noun, and the object\n    of a verb.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Nasal mutation is triggered by the plural article _in_, and the\n    prepositions _an, dan,_ and plural _'nin_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Mixed mutation is triggered by the genitive article _en_, and the\n    prepositions _ben, erin, nan, 'nin,_ and _uin_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Stop mutation is triggered by the prepositions _ed, ned,_ and\n    _o(d)_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Liquid mutation is presumably triggered by the preposition _or_.\n\nPronouns\n\nPronouns are perhaps the most poorly attested feature of Sindarin. What\nhas been reconstructed by the comparative method is largely conjectural\nand is not agreed upon, and therefore will not be addressed in this\narticle.\n\nSindarin pronouns, like those in English, still maintain some case\ndistinction. Sindarin pronouns have nominative, accusative, genitive,\nand dative forms.\n\n \n\nFirst Person\n\nSecond Person\n\nThird Person\n\n \n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nNominative\n\nim\n\nme\n\nle, ci\n\nle, ci\n\ne, te\n\nti\n\nAccusative\n\nnin\n\nmen\n\nlen, cin\n\nlen, cin\n\nten, den\n\ntin, hain\n\nGenitive\n\n \n\nmín\n\n \n\nlín\n\ndîn\n\n \n\nDative\n\nanim, enni\n\nammen\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEnclitic\n\n-n\n\n-m\n\n-ch\n\n \n\n—\n\n-r\n\nVerbs\n\nSindarin verbs are also quite complex. The number of attested verbs in\nSindarin is small, so the Sindarin verb system is imperfectly known; no\nverb has a full paradigm of forms available. There are two main types of\nverbs: _basic_ and _derived_. Basic verbs have stems which end in a\nconsonant, and derived verbs have stems which incorporate some sort\nderivational morpheme (such as a causative ending) which ends in _-a_.\n\nBasic Verbs\n\nBasic verbs, though smaller in number than derived verbs, have a very\ncomplex conjugation which arises from Sindarin's phonological history.\n\nBasic verbs form the infinitve by adding _-i_: _giri_ from _gir-_. This\nending causes an _a_ or _o_ in the stem to umlaut to _e_: _blebi_ from\n_blab-_. Sindarin does not use infinitive forms very often, and rather\nuses the gerund to achieve the same meaning.\n\nFor all persons except the third person singular, the present tense is\nformed by the insertion of _-i_, and the proper enclitic pronomial\nending: _girin_, _girim_, _girir_. As with the infinitive, _-i_ causes\nan _a_ or _o_ in the stem to umlaut to _e_: _pedin_, _pedim_, _pedir_,\nfrom _pad-_. The third person singular, because it has a zero-ending,\ndoes not require the insertion of _-i_. This leaves the bare stem,\nwhich, because of Sindarin's phonological history, causes the vowel of\nthe stem to become long: _gîr_, _blâb_, _pâd_.\n\nThe past tense of basic verbs is very complicated and poorly attested.\nOne common reconstructed system is to use _-n_: _darn_. However, the\nonly time this _-n_ actually remains is after a stem in _-r_. After a\nstem ending in _-l_, _-n_ becomes _-ll_: _toll_. After _-b, -d, -g, -v,_\nor _-dh_, it is metathesized and then assimilated to the same place of\narticulation as the consonant it now follows. The consonant then\nexperiences what could be called a “backwards mutation”: _-b, -d,_ and\n_-g_ become _-p, -b,_ and _-c_, and _-v_ and _-dh_ become _-m_ and _-d_.\nThe matter is complicated even further when pronomial endings are added.\nBecause _-mp, -mb, -nt, -nd,_ and _-nc_ did not survive medially, they\nbecome _-mm-, -mm-, -nn-, -nn-,_ and _-ng_. In addition, past tense\nstems in _-m_ would have _-mm-_ before any pronomial endings. Because\nthis all may seem rather overwhelming, look at these examples which show\nstep-by-step transformations:\n\n-   _cab-_ > **_cabn_ > **_canb_ > **_camb_ > _camp_, becoming _camm-_\n    with any pronomial endings.\n-   _ped-_ > **_pedn_ > **_pend_ > _pent_, becoming _penn-_ with any\n    pronomial endings.\n-   _dag-_ > **_dagn_ > **_dang_ (_n_ pronounced as in _men_) > **_dang_\n    (_n_ pronounced as in _sing_) > _danc_, becoming _dang-_ with any\n    pronomial endings.\n-   _lav-_ > **_lavn_ > **_lanv_ > **_lanm_ > **_lamm_ > _lam_, becoming\n    _lamm-_ before any pronomial endings.\n-   _redh-_ > **_redhn_ > **_rendh_ > **_rend_ > _rend_, becoming\n    _renn-_ before any pronomial endings.\n\nThe future tense is formed by the addition of _-tha_. An _-i_ is also\ninserted between the stem and _-tha_, which again causes _a_ and _o_ to\numlaut to _e_. Endings for all persons except for the first person\nsingular can be added without any further modification: _giritham_,\n_blebithar_. The first person singular ending _-n_ causes the _-a_ in\n_-tha_ to become _-o_: _girithon_, _blebithon_, _pedithon_.\n\nThe imperative is formed with the addition of _-o_ to the stem: _giro!_,\n_pado!_, _blabo!_.\n\nDerived Verbs\n\nDerived verbs have a much less complex conjugation because they have a\nthematic vowel (usually _a_) which reduces the number of consonant\ncombinations which occur.\n\nThe infinitive is formed with -o, which replaces the -a of the stem, e.\ng. _lacho_ from _lacha-_.\n\nThe present tense is formed without modification to the stem. Pronomial\nendings are added without any change.\n\nThe past tense is formed with the ending _-nt_, which becomes _-nne_\nwith any pronomial endings, e. g. _erthant_, _erthanner_.\n\nThe future tense is formed with _-tha_. With the addition of the first\nperson singular _-n_, this becomes _-tho_.\n\nThe imperative is formed like the infinitive.\n\n\nDialects\n\nDuring the First Age there were several dialects of Sindarin:\n\n-   _Doriathrin_ or the language of Doriath, a form of the language\n    which preserved many archaic forms;\n-   _Falathrin_ or the language of the Falas, later also spoken in\n    Nargothrond;\n-   _North Sindarin_, the dialects originally spoken in Dorthonion and\n    Hithlum by the Sindar, these dialects contained many unique words\n    and were not fully intelligible with the Sindarin of Beleriand\n    proper.\n\nWith the exception of Doriathrin, the dialects were changed under\nÑoldorin influence, and adopted many Quenya features, as well as unique\nsound changes devised by the Ñoldor (who loved changing languages). The\ndistinct dialects disappeared after the Ñoldor and Sindar were dispersed\nduring the later Battles of Beleriand. In the refuges on the Isle of\nBalar and the Mouths of Sirion a new dialect arose under the refugees,\nwhich mainly took after Falathrin. During the Second Age and Third Age\nSindarin was a lingua franca for all Elves and their friends, until it\nwas displaced as the Common tongue by Westron, a descendant of Adûnaic\nwhich was heavily influenced by Sindarin.\n\n_Sindarin_ is actually a Quenya term. The Sindarin word was perhaps\nEDHELLEN (“Elvish”).\n\n\nSample Phrases\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings_\n\n-   _Ai na vedui Dúnadan! Mae govannen!_ - Ah, at last, Westman! Well\n    met!\n-   _Noro lim._ - Run fast.\n-   _Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!

Only a few actual Rohirric\nwords are given by Tolkien: _kûd-dûkan_, an old word meaning\n“hole-dweller” which led to _kuduk_, the name the Hobbits had for\nthemselves. Even these terms were translated in the book: “hobbit” is\nsaid to derive from the Anglo-Saxon construction “hol-bytla”, or\nhole-builder.\n\nThe only other Rohirric given is the element “lô–”/“loh–” corresponding\nto Anglo-Saxon “éo” (horse), and the derived names _Lôgrad_ for\n_Horse-Mark_, and _Lohtûr_ for _Éothéod_, horse-people, or horse-land.\n\nAll names beginning with Éo– are actually names beginning with Lô– or\nLoh–, but the real forms of Éomer, Éowyn etc. are not given. Only one\nproper name is given, that of Théoden: the actual form was _Tûrac_,\nwhich implies that Rohirric had adopted the Sindarin element “tur–” also\npresent in names like Turgon, with meaning power/mastery (i.e. King).\n\nThe languages of the Kingdom of Rhovanion, Esgaroth, and Dale (often\ncalled Dalish or Dale-ish) were related to Rohirric.\n\nde:Rohirrische Sprache it:Rohirric ru:Роханский язык"

    "text": "VALARIN was the divine tongue of the Ainur, and the oldest of languages.\nWhile the Valar were angelic beings with the ability to communicate\nthrough thought, a spoken language was unnecessary. Valarin was\ndeveloped as part of their assumption of physical forms.\n\n\nHistory\n\nHowever, the Elves found Valarin alien, sometimes unpleasant, with very\nfew of them ever deigning to learn the language. Some Valarin words were\nadopted by the Elves as part of the growing Quenya lexicon, particularly\nby the Vanyar. The Valar learnt Quenya instead to converse with the\nElves or with each other if Elves were present.\n\nIt was not just the Elves who borrowed from Valarin. When Melkor and\nSauron devised the Black Speech, at least one word, NAZG (ring) was\nborrowed from the Valarin equivalent (NAŠKAD). As Ainur, both Melkor and\nSauron would have spoken Valarin.\n\nValarin bears no relation to any of the other Languages of Middle-earth\nas it arose beyond Arda. Little is known of it, save a few words (mainly\nproper names) although it seems that Valarin used lengthy constructions.\nThe Valarin word for Telperion is, for example, Ibrîniðilpathânezel,\nwhich is eight syllables long.\n\nThe only language before Valarin was the Music of the Ainur, the purest\nform of language as it was thought itself with a self-sufficient\nstructure. Eru Ilúvatar only showed the Ainur their music in a different\nform by adding the final note to their song: Eä, “_Be_”.\n\nIn the older versions of _The Silmarillion_ and in the Lhammas, it is\nshown that Valarin was further subdivided into three categories:\nOromëan, Aulëan and Melkian, with all Elven languages arising from the\nfirst category. J.R.R. Tolkien later rejected this view."

Tengwar can, however, be used to write many other\nlanguages.\n\nSEE ALSO: Languages of Middle-earth"

    "text": "ORKISH was the general term for the jumble of languages used by the\nOrcs, composed of corrupted borrowings from other languages of\nMiddle-earth, including Sauron's Black Speech and later Westron.\n\nWhen they were originally bred in the First Age, the Orcs had little\nmore language than beasts, but borrowed what they could from other\nlanguages and corrupted it to their liking. In the Second Age, Sauron\ncorrupted and combined Valarin and Quenya to create Black Speech, which\nhe intended to make the official language of all who served him. He\nultimately failed in this purpose, although several generations of Orcs\nwere probably bred in Mordor and raised on this language before the War\nof the Last Alliance.\n\nAfter Sauron's defeat at the end of the Second Age the Orcs were\ndivided. Eventually they had almost as many dialects as they had groups\nand settlements, and “Orkish” quickly became useless to them for\ninter-breed communication. So most Orcs learned to speak a debased form\nof Westron for this purpose. By the late Third Age the Goblin tribes of\nthe Misty Mountains adopted this primitive dialect as their official\nlanguage, and Saruman later had it taught to the Half-orcs and Uruk-hai\nof Isengard. The Black Uruks and Uruk-hai of Mordor also spoke Westron,\nbut their first language was a debased form of Black Speech combined\nwith Orkish. There was also a new breed of small tracker Orcs known as\n“Snufflers” originally bred in Mordor. These particular Orcs spoke\nWestron in the company of Uruk-hai and Black Uruks, which meant that\nthey did not share the same language, and instead had their own language\nor knew only Westron."

    "text": "GONDOR SINDARIN was a dialect of the Elven language spoken by the Men\nof Gondor.\n\n\nDifferences\n\nWestron was the first language of Gondor. The nobility usually learned\nSindarin, and used it to be polite to other nobles and strangers\nalike. Because it was both an acquired and a learned language, it had\nsome notable differences with “regular” Third Age Sindarin.\n\n\nPhonetical\n\nLike any acquired language, the second language's sound range is\ndirectly influenced by the speaker's original sound range. Westron did\nnot possess _ch_ or _y_, and pronounced them differently.\n\n\n“Y”\n\nThe _y_ was pronounced by Sindarin Elves as IPA , a close front\nrounded vowel. Of all languages, only Sindarin had this sound, so it was\nproblematic for speakers of other tongues. Gondorians generally\npronounced it as an _i_, though it was sometimes substituted with an\n_e_, as in the Gondorian plural for _onod_, _ened_ (rather than the\nusual _enyd_).\n\n\n“CH”\n\nAlso frequent in Sindarin was the _ch_, the velar fricative, which the\nGondorians also encountered among pre-Númenórean placenames such as\nErech and Eilenach.\n\nThe most notable use of the voiceless velar fricative was in the name of\nGondor's new northern neighbour, Rohan. Originally envisioned as\n_Rochand_, in Gondor this became _Rohan_. Though the tongue of the\nÉothéod did possess the voiced _ch_, it adopted the southern use. The\nvoiced velar fricative, which is found in _Rochand_, was pronounced as a\nsounded _h_, while the voiceless variant, at the end of words, was\npronounced as a _k_. Those very learned would pronounce them correct,\nbut forcibly so.\n\n\nPhilological\n\nAnother notable difference from regular Sindarin was purely\nphilological. Those Gondorians learned in lore wished to speak like\nNoldor, and the Sindarin they spoke in the First Age was North Sindarin.\nAt least one feature from North Sindarin was reintroduced: whereas “true\nSindarin of the Elves” changed both the voiced and voiceless combination\nof a sonorant consonant and a spirant to a long sonorant, the Gondor\nSindarin retained the spirant. Thus in the case of the former, _malt_\n(“gold”) and _orn_ (“tree”) became _Mallorn_, in Gondor this remained\n_Malthorn_."
