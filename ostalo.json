    "text": "The FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING was formed as a brotherhood among members of\nthe various Free Peoples of Middle-earth. Its purpose was to take the\nOne Ring to Mordor that it might be cast into the fires of Mount Doom,\nthe mountain in which it was forged, so that it would be destroyed and\nultimately kill the Dark Lord Sauron.\n\nThe '''Fellowship '''was also known as the COMPANY OF THE RING, the NINE\nWALKERS, or more simply the COMPANY. Each of the members of the Company\nwere representatives of their respective races, with Legolas and Gimli\nbeing the only Elf and Dwarf chosen.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFormation\n\nFormed after the Council of Elrond, the Fellowship consisted of nine\nmembers: four Hobbits, two Men, one Elf, one Dwarf, and one Wizard. It\nis the only known organisation/group ever formed in the history of\nMiddle-earth, to hold members of each of these races within it (and with\nthe departure of the Elves and the Wizards from Middle-earth, there\nwould never be another like it), who largely lived and acted\nindependently of one another (or in the case of Elves and Dwarves, felt\nactive animosity toward each other). This number was chosen to match the\nnumber of Ring Wraiths, also known as Black Riders, the Nazgúl or the\nNine Riders. Merry and Pippin were never intended to be a part of the\nFellowship, with Elrond considering two Elf-lords from his own house. He\nwished to send the two younger hobbits back to the Shire as messengers\nto warn other Hobbits of the growing evil. However, the Halflings\npersevere: Merry is chosen and Gandalf convinces Elrond of the loyalty\nof Pippin.\n\n\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring was formed by Elrond after the Council of\nElrond. The Fellowship, being led mainly by Gandalf, headed down the\npath to Mordor.\n\nAfter a long and difficult journey south from Rivendell, and a\nnear-catastrophic attempt to cross over the Misty Mountains, the\nFellowship descended into Moria. In the former Dwarf-kingdom, they found\nevidence that Orcs had slain Gimli's kinsman Balin and other Dwarves who\nhad returned there. They were soon confronted by the Balrog known as\n_Durin's Bane_, who had many Orc and Troll minions under his control.\nGandalf fell facing this menace, and the Company was forced to go on\nwithout him.\n\nOnce they escaped Moria, the Fellowship headed to the Elven forest of\nLothlórien where they spoke with the Elven Lord Celeborn and Galadriel,\nLady of Light. Galadriel supplied them each with special Elven Gifts\nfrom Lothlórien, boats and supplies so that they could travel down the\nriver Anduin. This route was quicker than an overland march, but the\ngroup was attacked by Orc archers and shadowed by Gollum, who had begun\nfollowing them in Moria.\n\nForced to portage their boats around the waterfall called Rauros, the\nFellowship soon ran into difficulties. Boromir finally succumbed to\ntemptation, and attempted to seize the Ring from Frodo. This led to\nFrodo using the Ring to escape and he and Sam leaving to spare the\nothers the lure of it. The repentant Boromir died trying to defend Merry\nand Pippin against a large force of Uruks from Isengard.\n\nThe Fellowship was dissolved on the banks of the Anduin that day. Frodo\nand Sam carried on towards Mordor; Boromir was given funerary rites and\nsent floating over the falls, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli departed on\ntheir way to save Merry and Pippin.\n\nBreaking of the Fellowship\n\nAfter Boromir died the Fellowship split into three paths. From there\nAragorn, Legolas and Gimli chased after the Uruk-hai who took Merry and\nPippin. Their plan was to take the hobbits to Saruman in Isengard. Along\nthe way the trio crossed through the Gap of Rohan and came across Éomer\nwho led the banished Riders of Rohan across the land. After questioning\nÉomer, they found out that the riders had already slain the Uruk-hai\nthey were meant to track, the night before in a bloody massacre. So upon\narriving to site of battle, Aragorn discovers that the hobbits fled deep\ninto Fangorn Forest.\n\nGandalf, though thought to be dead when he fell at the Bridge of Khazad\nDum in Moria, came back to Middle-earth, reincarnated as Gandalf the\nWhite. He encountered Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in Fangorn, and they,\nmistaking Gandalf for Saruman, attempted to kill him. Gandalf assured\nthem that Merry and Pippin were safe (knowing they were in the hands of\nTreebeard). From there they rode out to Edoras, capital of Rohan. It was\nthere they saw King Theoden in ill-condition, poisoned by Saruman's\nservant Grima Wormtongue.\n\nFrodo and Sam continued their journey, getting closer to Mordor. Gollum\nhad tailed them. While attempting to take “the precious” in their sleep,\nFrodo and Sam awoke and captured him. Frodo realizing who he was decided\nGollum could be used as guide into Mordor.\n\nThe Second Fellowship\n\nIn the book, Aragorn continues to call the company he leads (Legolas and\nGimli, occasionally joined by Gandalf, Merry, and Pippin) the Fellowship\nof the Ring even after the original Fellowship breaks up following\nBoromir's death. The fellowship is reunited again after the War of The\nRing up until Rohan, where the fellowship ends.\n\n  Name      Age\n  --------- ----------------------\n  Frodo     50\n  Samwise   38\n  Merry     36\n  Pippin    28\n  Aragorn   87\n  Boromir   40\n  Legolas   2000+\n  Gimli     139\n  Gandalf   2000+ (Middle-Earth)\n\n  : AGES OF THE MEMBERS (TA 3018)\n\n\nMembers"

    "page_id": "35",
    "text": "AULË (Quenya; IPA: - “Invention”) was an Ainur, one of the Aratar and a\nValar, who was responsible for fashioning and crafting the substances of\nwhich Arda, the world, was composed. He was also called '''Mahal\n'''(Khuzdul; IPA: “Maker”), '''Oli '''(Sindarin; IPA: “Dream”) or\nNÁVATAR and delights in the nature of substances and in works of skill,\nbut not concerned with possession or mastery. Besides the shaping of\nArda, Aulë's greatest works were the Two Lamps of the Valar, the vessels\nof the Sun and Moon, and the Dwarves, whom he created out of impatience\nfor the Children of Ilúvatar. He also created Angainor (the chain of\nMelkor).\n\n\nBiography\n\nAs Aulë was a smith, he was the Valar most similar in thought and powers\nto Melkor, in that they each gloried in the fashioning of artful and\noriginal things. Both also came to create beings of their own. But while\nAulë strove to be true to the original intent of the Music of the\nAinurs, and submitted all that he did to the will of Ilúvatar, Melkor\nwished to control and subvert all things, and was jealous of the\ncreations of others so that he would try to twist or destroy all that\nthey made. There was long strife between Aulë and Melkor both before and\nafter the creation of Arda. Aulë, however, traditionally opposed\nattempts to fight Melkor, for fear of the damage that would be wrought\nto Arda.\n\nWhen the Elves came to Valinor, the Ñoldor became the students of Aulë.\nFëanor was his greatest pupil, and from him learned to make gems through\ncraftsmanship that is now forgotten. This would eventually lead to the\nSilmarils, the greatest creation of handiwork within Arda. On the Flight\nof the Noldor, the Noldor who returned to Valinor under Finarfin named\nthemselves the _Aulendur_, Followers of Aulë. Despite his lordly skill,\nAulë was humble and compassionate, and indeed the Dwarves survived only\nbecause Aulë submitted them to the will of Ilúvatar. His spouse was\nYavanna, with whom he dwelt in central Valinor.\n\nThe Creation of the Dwarves\n\n\n\nDesperate for pupils onto whom he could pass his knowledge, and\nunwilling to wait for the emergence of the Children of Ilúvatar, Aulë\ncreated his own race of beings, the dwarves. However, he did not have a\nclear idea of what the Children of Ilúvatar would be like, and because\nof the presence of the chaos caused by Melkor, Aulë made the Dwarves\nstrong and unyielding, and not willing to endure the domination of\nothers, as well as embodying some of his values and desires for\nMiddle-earth. However Aulë did not have the power to give independent\nlife to his creations, they could act only when his thought was on them.\n\nWhen Aulë completed his work he began to instruct the Dwarves in a\nlanguage he had made for them, Khuzdul. Then Ilúvatar spoke to Aulë,\nasking why he would seek to exceed his power and authority by attempting\nto make new life. Aulë repented, answering that the drive to create was\nkindled in him by Ilúvatar, and that he only wished for other beings to\nlove and teach, with whom to share in the beauty of the world. He\nadmitted that his impatience had driven him to folly and submitted his\ncreations to Ilúvatar. Assuming that they should be destroyed, he made\nto smite the seven Fathers of the Dwarves with a great hammer.  As he\nraised the hammer the Dwarves shrank from the coming blow, but Ilúvatar\nstayed Aulë's hand and showed that he had accepted Aulë's offer by\ngifting the Dwarves with spirits of their own, else they could not have\nbeen afraid.\n\nIlúvatar accepted the Dwarves as his adopted children however, as it was\nordained that the elves were to be the first-born race, Ilúvatar set the\nDwarves to sleep until after the Awakening of the Elves. He told Aulë\nthat while both were his children, their creation was outside the scope\nof the Music of the Ainur, and strife would arise between the Dwarven\nrace and the Elven race as the events of the world unfolded. The Dwarves\nbelieve that after they die their spirits move to halls that Aulë has\nset aside for them alone, and that their role will be to rebuild Arda\nafter the Final Battle.\n\n\nMaiar of Aulë\n\n-   Mairon (Sauron), the mightiest of the Maiar of Aulë who used his\n    knowledge of the metaphysical structure of Arda to great effect as a\n    servant of Melkor in the First Age of Middle-earth and then was his\n    own master in the Second and Third Ages. When Sauron sought to\n    corrupt the elves in the Second Age one of the names he assumed was\n    Aulendil, meaning devotee of Aulë.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Curumo (Saruman), the leader of the wizards sent to lead the people\n    of Middle-earth against Sauron, only to betray his fellow wizards\n    and ally with Sauron himself (who he also betrayed in the end).\n\nIt is interesting to note that two of the greatest Maiar sent to\nMiddle-earth, that fell, were in the beginning both aligned with Aulë.\nThe reason for this is probably that this is the order most associated\nwith craft, skill, and by these means, power. Weaker-willed spirits\noften fall prey to craving for power in Tolkien's works, and these prove\nno exception. Also, Tolkien generally sees industry as corruption. It\nseems Maiar of Aulë are the most powerful Maia because they are the\nclosest to Ilúvatar's creation skills.\n\n\nPowers\n\nAulë seems to have a power most akin to Ilúvatar's - he can create an\ninnumerable amount of things. He made the Two Lamps, and made Angainor,\nMorgoth's chain. Although he does not have access to the Flame\nImperishable, he was able to create life (although it does not have free\nwill). As a Valar, he possesses incredible strength, and has been noted\nto have rebuilt Arda during and after Morgoth's period of destruction\nbefore the coming of the Elves. He likely forged the Valar's weaponry\nand armor for the War of Wrath. His strength is in the construction of\nnew things, and he is as near to the antithesis of the destructive\nMorgoth as one can be.﻿\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Aulë_ means ''invention ''in Quenya.\n\n_Mahal_ means ''maker ''in Khuzdul.\n\n_Oli_ means _dream_ in Sindarin."

    "title": "The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)",
    "page_id": "43",
    "text": "_THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING_ is the first of three volumes of\nthe novel _The Lord of the Rings_. It is divided into two books, Book I\nand II. It was originally released on July 29, 1954 in the United\nKingdom by Allen and Unwin.\n\n\nPrologue\n\nThe book begins with a prologue, which summarizes the events of the\nfirst book, _The Hobbit_. It gives you the backstory of the ring and how\nit came to be. It tells how the creator, Sauron first came upon it. It\ngives the backstory of Sméagol and his friend Déagol and how they came\nupon the Ring after Sauron was temporarily defeated. It also explains\nhow Bilbo Baggins found the One Ring after Sméagol, who had become\nGollum, lost it. Then Bilbo returns to Bag End in The Shire, and the\nstory of Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's nephew, begins.\n\nParts\n\n-   '''I- '''Concerning Hobbits\n-   '''II- '''Concerning Pipe-Weed\n-   '''III- '''Of the Ordering of the Shire\n-   IV- Of the Finding of the Ring\n-   V- Note on the Shire Records\n\n\nBook I: The First Journey / The Ring Sets Out\n\n The first sets the stage\nfor the adventure and follows Frodo Baggins as he flees from his home in\nthe Shire to escape the minions of the Dark Lord Sauron. Sauron seeks\nthe One Ring that will allow him to control the Bearers of the nineteen\nother Rings and control the three major races of Middle-earth: Elves,\nMen, and Dwarves. The One Ring has been inherited by Frodo who finds\nhimself unwittingly in the midst of a struggle for world domination.\n\nThe first chapter in the book begins quite lightly, following on from\n_The Hobbit_ which is more of a whimsical children's story than _The\nLord of the Rings_. It begins with Bilbo celebrating his 111th (or\neleventy first, as it is called) birthday, on the same day that Frodo\ncelebrates his 33rd birthday (his 'coming of age'). At the birthday\nparty, Bilbo disappears after his speech, to the surprise of all. Frodo\nlater learns about the ring which he had used to make himself invisible,\nand also about some of its darker powers.\n\nHeeding the advice of the wizard Gandalf, Frodo leaves his home, taking\nthe Ring with him. He hopes to reach Rivendell, where he will be safe\nfrom Sauron, and where those wiser than he can decide what to do about\nthe Ring.\n\nIn his journey he is accompanied by three hobbit friends, Peregrin Took,\nMeriadoc Brandybuck and Samwise Gamgee, often refered to as Merry,\nPippin and Sam. From the start they are pursued by Black Riders, the\nRingwraiths who serve Sauron. Narrowly escaping these and other dangers\nand meeting other interesting characters en route (e.g., Tom Bombadil)\nthey eventually come to Bree, where they meet Strider, another friend of\nGandalf who leads them the rest of the way to Rivendell, through further\nhardships. Frodo is stabbed upon the mountain of Weathertop by the chief\nof the Nazgûl with a 'Morgul blade' - as part of the knife stays inside\nhim, he gets sicker on the rest of the journey. They also pass the\ntrolls which had been turned to stone in the previous book, _The\nHobbit_.\n\nChapters\n\n-   I - A LONG-EXPECTED PARTY - details Bilbo and Frodo's Birthday\n    Party; chapter ends with Bilbo leaving the\n    Shire.\n-   II - THE SHADOW OF THE PAST - Gandalf tells Frodo the true nature of\n    the ring, and how it must be taken to Mordor and destroyed. Sam, who\n    has been listening at the window, is told to accompany Frodo.\n-   III - THREE IS COMPANY - Frodo sells Bag End, and officially is\n    going to move to a house at Crickhollow in the area beyond\n    Bucklebury in Buckland; he actually plans to disappear without\n    causing too much of a fuss. Frodo, Sam and Pippin set out through\n    the South Farthing of the Shire towards Buckland, and encounter a\n    black rider. They also meet Gildor the wood elf, with other wood\n    elves.\n-   IV - A SHORT CUT TO MUSHROOMS - They meet Farmer Maggot while taking\n    a short cut, and he gives them some of his prized mushrooms. Merry\n    joins them at the end.\n-   V - A CONSPIRACY UNMASKED - Takes place at Frodo's new house at\n    Crickhollow. The title refers to Frodo about to tell Merry and\n    Pippin about his quest, who he had previously believed not to know\n    about it, and they tell him that they had known much of it all\n    along. They also meet Fatty Bolger. Frodo decides to leave the next\n    day through the Old Forest, as it is an unexpected direction, rather\n    than travelling on the roads.\n-   VI - THE OLD FOREST - Although trying to avoid it, the hobbits get\n    lost and travel to the River Withywindle, the “queerest part of the\n    whole wood”. Merry and Pippin are trapped inside Old Man Willow, and\n    are freed only when Tom Bombadil arrives.\n-   VII - IN THE HOUSE OF TOM BOMBADIL - Tom knows much about the\n    hobbits, and even tries on the Ring, yet it does not have any effect\n    on him - it doesn't even make him invisible. Frodo tries on the ring\n    then to see if it 'works', and Tom Bombadil is also able to see\n    Frodo while he has the ring on.\n-   VIII - FOG ON THE BARROW-DOWNS - Travelling through the\n    Barrow-downs, the hobbits are imprisoned by Barrow-wights, where\n    they are rescued again by Tom Bombadil. The hobbits are given\n    daggers from the treasure in one of the downs.\n-   IX - AT THE SIGN OF THE PRANCING PONY - The hobbits reach the The\n    Prancing Pony inn at Bree, where Frodo uses a false name, Underhill.\n    Later, after singing a song on a table, he trips and accidentally\n    puts the ring on his finger, disappearing, which causes a commotion.\n-   X - STRIDER - Strider, who had at first seemed menacing, turns out\n    to be friendly. The innkeeper, Butterbur, gives Frodo a late letter\n    from Gandalf, which tells him that Strider is a friend of Gandalf's\n    whose real name is Aragorn.\n-   XI - A KNIFE IN THE DARK - The hobbits with Strider set out from\n    Bree on foot after their horses had bolted when Black Riders arrived\n    at the inn at night. The Riders had attacked the beds which they\n    were supposed to be staying in, though in vain as Strider had them\n    stay in another room. They buy a pony from Bill Ferny. They pass\n    through the Midgewater Marshes, and reach Weathertop. There they are\n    attacked by five Black Riders; Frodo puts on the ring to escape\n    them, and is stabbed in the shoulder by the Witch-king of Angmar,\n    leader of the nine Ringwraiths (Nazgul).\n-   XII - FLIGHT TO THE FORD - They pass the trolls Bert, Tom and\n    William, which were turned to stone by Gandalf in _The Hobbit_.\n    Eventually, they meet the elf Glorfindel from Rivendell, who allows\n    Frodo to take his white horse to escape the Ringwraiths on their way\n    to Rivendell. The Black Riders are washed away in The Flood over the\n    Ford.\n\n\nBook II: The Journey of the Nine Companions / The Ring Goes South\n\nBook II chronicles Frodo's stay at Rivendell, where a plan is hatched at\nthe Council of Elrond to destroy the Ring in Mordor. Early on Frodo\nmeets his uncle Bilbo, whom he had not seen since he left Hobbiton much\nearlier. Frodo sets forth from Rivendell with nine companions: two Men,\nAragorn and Boromir, son of the Steward of the land of Gondor; an Elven\nprince, Legolas; Frodo's old friend and powerful wizard, Gandalf; Gimli\nthe Dwarf; and Frodo's original three hobbit companions. These Nine\nWalkers were chosen to represent the free races of Middle-earth and as a\nbalance to the Nine Riders. They were also accompanied by Bill the Pony,\nwhom Strider and the Hobbits acquired in Bree as a pack horse. Their\nattempt to cross the Misty Mountains is foiled by heavy snow, so they\nare forced to take a path under the mountains via Moria, an ancient\nDwarf kingdom, now full of Orcs and other evil creatures, such as the\nWatcher in the Water guarding the south gate. Just before escaping\nMoria, Gandalf falls into the abyss while battling a Balrog.\n\nThe remaining eight members of the Fellowship then spend some time in\nthe elf-haven of Lothlórien, where they receive gifts from the Elf-queen\nGaladriel that in many cases prove useful later in the quest. They leave\nLórien by river, but Frodo begins to realize the Ring is having a\nmalevolent effect on some members of the party, especially Boromir, who\ntries to take the ring from Frodo. In the process, Frodo puts on the\nring to escape him. Later Boromir is attacked by orcs while trying to\ndefend Merry and Pippin. This book ends when Frodo and Sam depart\nsecretly for Mordor and the Fellowship of the Ring dissolves.\n\nChapters\n\n-   I - MANY MEETINGS - After awakening from a sleep for four days,\n    Frodo meets Gandalf and Bilbo again, as well as Gloin, the dwarf\n    from _The Hobbit_, Elrond, and others.\n-   II_' - The Council of Elrond_' - A council attended by many people;\n    Gandalf tells the story of his escape from Saruman; they decide that\n    the ring must be destroyed and Frodo offers to take it to Mordor.\n-   III_' - The Ring goes South_' - The nine members of the fellowship\n    travel south through Hollin; they try to take the road over the\n    mountain Caradhras but are forced to turn back.\n-   IV_' - A Journey in the Dark_' - They travel to the gates of Moria,\n    where they have to deal with a creature in the lake in front of it.\n    Gandalf eventually opens the doors by speaking the correct password.\n    They reach the tomb of Balin.\n-   V_' - The Bridge of Khazad-dûm_' - Attacked by Orcs, trolls and a\n    Balrog of Morgoth, they make their way to the bridge in Khazad-dûm,\n    where Gandalf and the balrog fall.\n-   VI_' - Lothlórien_' - The company meets the elves of Lórien. The\n    elves reluctantly agree to let Gimli the dwarf pass. Aragorn takes\n    Frodo to the hill of Cerin Amroth.\n-   VII_' - The Mirror of Galadriel_' - The company meets Celeborn and\n    Galadriel. Frodo is shown the mirror of Galadriel.\n-   VIII_' - Farewell to Lórien_' - The elves give them cloaks, elven\n    bread, and other gifts; they then leave Lórien on boats down the\n    Great River.\n-   IX_' - The Great River_' - they notice Gollum following them down\n    the river on a log; Orc Archers attack the boats; A Winged Nazgûl is\n    seen flying above the Fellowship's boats, and is shot down by\n    Legolas, who fires an arrow at the rider's flying beast; they reach\n    the falls of Rauros, where they must choose between travelling on\n    the east or west bank of the river to pass the falls.\n-   X_' - The Breaking of the Fellowship_' - They arrive at the lawn of\n    Parth Galen; they still face the choice of whether to go east or\n    west; Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, who puts it on to\n    escape him. The rest of the company splits up trying to find Frodo.\n    Sam finds Frodo by the river and they cross it, thereby breaking up\n    the the Fellowship and continuing to Mount Doom on their own.\n\nBehind the events that befall the Ring-bearer and the Fellowship, the\nreader begins to sense an awakening of the true nature of the story.\nThere lurks always an idea of destiny, and in the end, it will be a\nconcatenation of the effects spawned by the nature of Good itself, that\nundoes the greatest Evil. Frodo says of the ring's first slave, Gollum,\n“What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature, when he had a\nchance!” and Gandalf's wise response is\n\n    “Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to\n    strike without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure\n    that he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end,\n    because he began his ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.”\n\n\nNotable Characters\n\n-   Frodo Baggins\n-   Bilbo Baggins\n-   Tom Bombadil\n-   Gandalf\n-   Saruman\n-   Sauron\n-   Samwise Gamgee (Sam)\n-   Meriadoc Brandybuck (Merry)\n-   Peregrin Took (Pippin)\n-   Elrond\n-   Galadriel\n-   Aragorn\n-   Boromir\n-   Gimli\n-   Legolas\n\n+:------------------:+:-------------------------:+:------------------:+\n| Previous novel:    | LORD OF THE RINGS         | Next novel:        |\n| FIRST IN SERIES    | NOVELS                    | THE TWO TOWERS     |\n+--------------------+---------------------------+--------------------+"

    "page_id": "61",
    "text": "HOBBITS, also known as HALFLINGS, were an ancient mortal race that lived\nin Middle-earth. Although their exact origins are unknown, they were\ninitially found in the northern regions of Middle-earth and below the\nVales of Anduin. At the beginning of the Third Age, Hobbits moved north\nand west. Most of their race eventually founded the land of the Shire in\nabout the year TA 1601, though one type of Hobbit known as _Stoors_\nremained in the Anduin Vale (the type of Hobbit Sméagol was).\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe exact origins of the Hobbits are unknown and it is also unknown what\nAge the Hobbits first appeared. Hobbits are known to have originated\nsomewhere in the Valley of the Anduin River. During their early history,\nthere were three sub-species of Hobbit. By the time they were discovered\nby the other peoples of Middle-earth, they had already been around for\nmany generations. The earliest known group of hobbits lived in the\nValley of Anduin, in the region of Wilderland between Mirkwood and the\nMisty Mountains. According to The Lord of the Rings, they have lost the\ngenealogical details of how they are related to the Big People. At this\ntime, there were three breeds, or tribes, of Hobbits, with different\nphysical characteristics and temperaments: Harfoots, Stoors and\nFallohides. While situated in the valley of the Anduin River, the\nHobbits lived close by the Éothéod, the ancestors of the Rohirrim, and\nthis led to some contact between the two. As a result, many old words\nand names in “Hobbitish” are derivatives of words in Rohirric.\n\nAbout the year TA 1050, they undertook the arduous task of crossing the\nMisty Mountains. Reasons for this trek are unknown, but it possibly had\nto do with Sauron's growing power in nearby Greenwood, which was later\nnamed _Mirkwood_ because of the shadow that fell on it, as Sauron was\nsearching the area for the One Ring. The Hobbits took different routes\nin their journey westward, but as they began to settle together in\nBree-land, Dunland, and the Angle formed by the rivers Hoarwell and\nLoudwater; the divisions between the Hobbit-kinds began to blur.\n\nIn the year 1601 of the Third Age, two Fallohide brothers named Marcho\nand Blanco gained permission from the King of Arnor at Fornost to cross\nthe River Baranduin and settle on the other side. Many Hobbits followed\nthem, and most of the territory they had settled in the Third Age was\nabandoned. Only Bree and a few surrounding villages lasted towards the\nend of the Third Age. The new land that they founded on the west bank of\nthe Brandywine was called the Shire. The crossing of the Brandywine, as\nthe hobbits called it, was the event that led to the settlement of the\nShire, thus the Shire Reckoning began. Originally, the Hobbits of the\nShire swore nominal allegiance to the last Kings of Arnor, being\nrequired only to acknowledge their lordship, speed their messengers, and\nkeep the bridges and roads in repair. During the final fight against\nAngmar at the Battle of Fornost, the Hobbits maintain that they sent a\ncompany of archers to help, but this is recorded nowhere else. After the\nbattle, the kingdom of Arnor was destroyed, and in absence of the king,\nthe Hobbits elected a Thain of the Shire from among their own\nchieftains.\n\nThe first Thain of the Shire was Bucca of the Marish, who founded the\nOldbuck family. However, the Oldbuck family later crossed the Brandywine\nRiver to create the separate land of Buckland and the family name\nchanged to the familiar “Brandybuck”. Their patriarch then became Master\nof Buckland. With the departure of the Oldbucks/Brandybucks, a new\nfamily was selected to have its chieftains be Thain: the Took family\n(Indeed, Pippin Took was son of the Thain and would later become Thain\nhimself). The Thain was in charge of Shire Moot and Muster and the\nHobbitry-in-arms, but as the Hobbits of the Shire led entirely peaceful,\nuneventful lives, the office of Thain was seen as something more of a\nformality. The major political power in the Shire was actually held by\nthe Mayor of Michel Delving (the Shire's chief township). His duties\nincluded overseeing the post and the “police” force (Shirriffs); he was\nalso obliged to preside at banquets. The Hobbits' numbers dwindled, and\ntheir stature became progressively smaller after the Fourth Age.\nHowever, they are sometimes spoken of in the present tense, and the\nprologue “Concerning Hobbits” in _The Lord of the Rings_ states that\nthey have survived into Tolkien's day.\n\n\nTypes of Hobbits\n\n-   The Harfoots were the most common Hobbits. They were smaller and\n    shorter than the other kinds and had browner skin. They did not grow\n    beards and rarely wore shoes or boots. They were skilled with their\n    hands and feet and preferred hillsides and highlands to live in. In\n    ancient times, they had frequent contact with the Dwarves of\n    Middle-earth and lived in the foothills of the mountains for a long\n    time. While the other varieties of Hobbits were still in the\n    Wilderland, the Harfoots moved west, travelling across Eriador as\n    far as Weathertop.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The Stoors often chose to live near water or on flat land. They were\n    broader and heavier in build than the other Hobbits and their feet\n    and hands were larger. They were the most reluctant variety of\n    Hobbit to leave the River Anduin, where some Stoors continued to\n    stay. Others travelled west after the Harfoots and followed the\n    River Loudwater southward. Many of the Stoors settled between\n    Tharbad and the borders of Dunland before they continued north.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The Fallohides, who preferred trees and woodland, were the least\n    common variety of Hobbits. They had fairer skin and hair and were\n    taller and slimmer than the others. They also had better relations\n    with the elves of Middle-earth, were more skilled with language and\n    song, and preferred hunting to tilling. They crossed the mountains\n    north of Rivendell and then followed the River Hoarwell.\n\nAlthough the Hobbits took different routes west, they eventually arrived\nin a land between the River Baranduin (which they renamed the\nBrandywine) and the Weather Hills. There, they founded many settlements,\nand the divisions between the varieties of Hobbits began to blur. By TA\n3001, the Hobbits of the Shire included families of Bagginses, Boffins,\nTooks, Brandybucks, Grubbs, Chubbs, Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles,\nand Proudfoots.\n\nOriginally, Fallohides were often found as leaders among clans of the\nother Hobbits. Around the year TA 1600, two Fallohide brothers, Marcho\nand Blanco, decided to journey across the River Brandywine and settle on\nthe other side. Large groups of Hobbits followed them, and most of their\nformer territory was depopulated. The Hobbits who had left called their\nnew home the Shire.\n\nThe Hobbits of the Shire originally swore their allegiance to the last\nKings of Arnor. However, after the Battle of Fornost, the kingdom of\nArnor was destroyed. To replace the king's authority and leadership, the\nHobbits elected their first Thain of the Shire, Bucca of the Marish,\nfrom among their own chieftains. The Thain was responsible for mustering\nthe Shire-Moot and -Muster, and leading the Hobbitry-in-arms in\nemergency situations. However, conflict rarely threatened the Hobbits of\nthe Shire, and the Thain usually had no need to exercise his\nauthority.\n\n\nAge and appearance\n\n\n\nMost Hobbits lived longer than Men, a race of which they might have been\nan off-shoot. The average lifespan of a Hobbit was about 100 years,\nthough it was not unusual for a Hobbit to live as many as three decades\nbeyond that. The time at which a young Hobbit matured and was accepted\nas an adult was 33, compared to a Man's 18 years. Thus, a 50-year-old\nHobbit would only be middle-aged. The most distinguishing feature of\nHobbits was their short stature. They were smaller than Dwarves and were\nusually between two and four feet in height. With the gradual passing of\ntime, Hobbits became even shorter. By the Third Age, they were usually\nless than three feet tall. Hobbits' ears were slightly pointed and their\nfurry feet had leathery soles, so they generally didn't need (and rarely\nwore) shoes or boots. Tolkien wrote that a typical Hobbit had a “round,\njovial face; ears only slightly pointed and 'elvish'.” Hobbits were\nskilled listeners and had good eyesight. Although they were inclined to\nbe fat and did not hurry unnecessarily, they were also nimble and deft\nin their movements. In _The Hobbit_, Bilbo manages to sneak up on the\nTrolls without them hearing him because he, like all Hobbits, could walk\naround very quietly. The Hobbits who lived in the Shire dressed in\nbright colors and were fond of yellow and green. Their hair usually\nranges from a light or dark brown to blonde or a golden red and is\nalmost always curly.\n\n\nCulture\n\nMost Hobbits enjoyed farming, food, ales, parties and the giving and\nreceiving of presents. They were usually friendly and happy-go-lucky,\nalthough they were often shy of Men. Hobbits preferred a quiet, normal,\nand peaceful life, which is why Gandalf was frowned upon sometimes,\nbecause he brought adventure to Bilbo. Many of them had seen him\nreturning from his long journey to the Lonely Mountain (the journey told\nof in _The Hobbit_) with his steed laden with great chests of gold. They\nalso have developed a keen taste in the smoking of Pipe-weed and blowing\nsmoke rings. This was first started by Tobold Hornblower of Longbottom\nin the Southfarthing. They were very ignorant and knew little of the\nhappenings of the world. They dwelt in Hobbit-holes (known also as\nSmials).\n\nHobbits, particularly those of the Shire are very insular and suspicious\nof other people from other places and anything that disturbs the peace.\nHobbits refer to people outside the Shire as OUTSIDERS, being a very\nbroad term, were simply those foreign to any region.\n\nSpeech\n\nIn ''The Hobbit ''and _The Lord of the Rings_, the vernacular of the\nShire is the Common Speech. Some names of families and locations\noriginated from variants and contractions of Mannish words (e.g.\n_Holman_ Cotton's name simply meaning “hole-man”), if not simply\nindividual or contractions of English words (e.g. _Bracegirdle_,\n_Cotton_, _Daisy_, _Bowman_, _Ruby_). The Stoors, however, who in early\ntimes did not dwell in the Shire, are said to have probably adopted\nspeech similar to Dunlendish. \n\nThe only occurrences of Hobbits speaking in other tongues as if\nnaturally are the times in _The Return of the King_ when Frodo and Sam\nfind themselves invoking Elbereth out loud, or when Frodo cries the\nQuenya phrase ''Aiya elenion ancalima! ''to break the spell of the\nWatchers at the Tower of Cirith Ungol. \n\nLifestyle\n\n\n\nHobbits are fond of an unadventurous bucolic life of farming, eating,\nand socializing. According to Jackson's trilogy, they enjoy seven meals\na day, when they can get them: breakfast, second breakfast, elevensies,\nluncheon, afternoon tea, dinner, and, later in the evening, supper. In\nthe book, however, supper is simply an alternative name for dinner;\nBilbo only served three official meals at his Birthday Party: lunch,\ntea, and dinner (or supper). They like simple food such as bread, meat,\npotatoes, and cheese, and also like to drink ale, often in inns — such\nas the English country folk, who were Tolkien's inspiration. They have\nalso been known to have a particular fondness for cake. The name Tolkien\nchose for one part of Middle-earth where the Hobbits live, “The Shire”,\nis clearly reminiscent of the English Shires. Hobbits also enjoy smoking\nherbs, which they refer to as “pipe-weed”, out of long wooden pipes.\nThis can be attributed to their love of gardening and herb-lore (as\nexemplified by Sam Gamgee). Another interesting fact is that hobbits\nhave an inordinate liking of mushrooms, prizing them above many other\nfoods. A common pursuit for younger hobbits is mushroom-hunting, and\nFrodo Baggins said he had stolen Farmer Maggot's mushrooms on at least\none occasion. Some Hobbits live in hobbit-holes, known as “smials” which\nresembled the characteristics of the original places where they dwelt\nunderground. They were found in hillsides, downs, and banks. By the late\nThird Age, only rich and poor hobbits continued to live in smials; the\nmiddle-class hobbits usually lived in large, low buildings, like Brandy\nHall. Almost every building in the Shire has round doors and windows, a\nfeature more practical to tunnel-dwelling that the Hobbits retained in\ntheir later structures.\n\nAlthough Hobbits are a peaceful people, who usually shun fighting, they\nare also, as a race, uncanny marksmen adept with missile weapons of all\nkinds, from throwing stones to slings and bows - hence the company of\narchers purportedly sent to aid the Arnorians at the Battle of Fornost.\nShire lore says that squirrels, rabbits, and other garden pests have\nlearned to run away quickly if a hobbit so much as reaches for a pebble.\n\n\nAppearance\n\nIn the prologue to The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien said that Hobbits are\nbetween two and four feet (0.6m-1.2m) tall, the average height being\nthree feet six inches. In another instance Tolkien described hobbits as\nbeing “between 3 and 4 feet tall, never less and seldom more”. They are\nnot quite as stocky as the similarly-sized dwarves, but still tend to be\nstout, with slightly pointed ears. Tolkien says the following of the\nHobbit Bilbo Baggins:\n\n“I picture a fairly human figure, not a kind of fairy rabbit as some of\nmy British reviewers seem to fancy: fat in the stomach, shortish in the\nleg. A round, jovial face; ears only slightly pointed and 'elvish'; hair\nshort and curling (brown). The feet from the ankles down, covered with\nbrown hairy fur that are extremely small. Clothing: green velvet\nbreeches; red or yellow waistcoat; brown or green jacket; gold (or\nbrass) buttons; a dark green hood and cloak (belonging to a dwarf).”\n\nIn the Prologue to _The Lord of the Rings_, he wrote that they dress in\nbright colours, favouring yellow and green. Nowadays (according to\nTolkien's fiction), they are very shy creatures, but they are and have\nbeen capable of amazing things. Their feet are covered with curly hair\n(usually brown, as is the hair on their heads) and have leathery soles,\nso most Hobbits hardly ever wear shoes. Hobbits (Halflings) are often\ndepicted with large feet for their size, perhaps to visually emphasize\ntheir unusual nature. This is especially prominent in the influential\nillustrations by the Brothers Hildebrandt and the large prosthetic feet\nused in the films by Peter Jackson. Tolkien does not specifically give\nsize as a generic hobbit trait, but does makes it the distinctive trait\nof the Proudfoot hobbit clan. Hobbits can sometimes live for up to one\nhundred and thirty years, although their average life expectancy is one\nhundred years. The time at which a young Hobbit “comes of age” is\nthirty-three. Thus, a fifty-year-old Hobbit would only look 26–30 years\nby human standards.\n\nThe Hobbits had a distinct calendar. Every year started on a Saturday\nand ended on a Friday, with each of the twelve months consisting of\nthirty days. Some special days did not belong to any month - Yule 1 and\n2 (New Year's Eve and New Years Day) and three Lithedays in mid summer.\nEvery fourth year there was an extra Litheday.\n\n\nBirthdays\n\nThe Hobbits of the Shire developed the custom of giving away gifts on\ntheir birthdays instead of receiving them. They use the term Mathom for\nold and assorted objects, which are invariably given as presents many\ntimes over or were stored in a museum (Mathom-house).\n\nInstead of saying “one hundred and twelve” they say “eleventy two” and\nthat with every other three plus digit number (although in Jackson's\nTrilogy, Bilbo tells the party-goers that it was his One Hundred and\nEleventh Birthday).\n\n\nEtymology and Names\n\nThe name “Hobbit” is derived from the Rohirric word _Holbytla_, a word\nwhich means “Hole-builder”. In the original Common Speech, the name was\nKuduk (Hobbit), derived from the actual Rohirric Kûd-dûkan (hole\ndweller)."

    "title": "The Two Towers (novel)",
    "page_id": "88",
    "text": "_For the LPMUD of the same name, see The Two Towers (MUD)._\n\n_THE TWO TOWERS_ is the second novel in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.\n\n\n\n_THE TWO TOWERS_ is the second volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's _The Lord of\nthe Rings_. It is preceded by _The Fellowship of the Ring_ and followed\nby _The Return of the King_.\n\n\nTitle\n\n\n\nTolkien came up with the title under deadline pressure and later\nexpressed dissatisfaction with it. In letters and one sketch, he\nconsidered several possible sets of towers, including Minas Tirith and\nBarad-dûr, and even the possibility of leaving the matter ambiguous.\nHowever, he eventually settled on Orthanc and Minas Morgul and wrote a\nnote to this effect which appears at the end of most editions of _The\nFellowship of the Ring_. He also produced a final cover illustration\nshowing these towers, but the publisher decided not to use it in order\nto save money on the production costs.\n\nLoosely, any pair from a set of six towers in the story could plausibly\nfit the title: Cirith Ungol, Orthanc, Minas Tirith, Barad-dûr, Minas\nMorgul, and the Hornburg.\n\n\nStructure\n\nBecause _The Two Towers_ is the central portion of a longer work, its\nstructure differs from that of a conventional novel. It begins and ends\nabruptly, without introduction to the characters, explanations of major\nplot elements or a satisfying conclusion. The first section follows the\ndivergent paths of several important figures from _The Fellowship of the\nRing_, but tells nothing of its central character, on whose fate so much\ndepends, enabling the reader to share in the suspense and uncertainty of\nthe characters themselves. The narrative of the second part returns to\nthe hero's quest to destroy the evil that threatens the world. While the\nfirst section tells of an epic battle, the struggles in much of the\nsecond are internal.\n\n\nContents\n\nBook III: The Treason of Isengard\n\n\n\nHobbits Merry and Pippin escape from the Orcs who captured them when the\norcs themselves are attacked by the Riders of Rohan. Merry and Pippin\nhead into nearby Fangorn Forest where they encounter treelike giants\ncalled Ents.\n\nThe forest generally keep to themselves, but are moved to oppose the\nmenace posed to the trees by the wizard Saruman, who has been chopping\ndown trees in the forest to fuel fires for his furnaces.\n\nAragorn, Gimli the Dwarf and Legolas the Elf, tracking Merry and Pippin,\ncome across the Riders of Rohan who tell them that they attacked the\norcs the previous night and left no survivors. However, Strider is able\nto find small prints and they follow these into Fangorn, where they meet\na white wizard who they at first believe to be Saruman, but who turns\nout to be their wizard friend Gandalf, whom they believed had perished\nin the mines of Moria. He tells them of his fall into the abyss, his\nbattle to the death with the Balrog and his reawakening. The four ride\nto Edoras and persuade King Théoden that his people are in danger. In\nthe process, Saruman's agent in Edoras, Grima Wormtongue, is expelled\nfrom the city. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas then travel to the defensive\nfortification Helm's Deep while Gandalf goes north in search of\nErkenbrand's men to bring as reinforcements. At Helm's Deep, they resist\nan onslaught of Orcs and Men sent by Saruman, and Gandalf arrives the\nnext morning with the Westfold army led by Erkenbrand just in time. The\nfleeing orcs run into a forest of Huorn half-tree, half-ent creatures\nand none escape. Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Gandalf and the Rohirric army\nthen head to Saruman's stronghold in Isengard.\n\nThere, they reunite with Merry and Pippin and find the city overrun by\nEnts, who have flooded it with the nearby river, and the central tower\nof Orthanc besieged, with Saruman in it. After giving Saruman a chance\nto repent, Gandalf casts him out of the order of wizards. Wormtongue\nthrows something from a window at Gandalf and those with him. This turns\nout to be one of the _palantíri_. Pippin, unable to resist the urge,\nlooks into it and has an encounter with Sauron. Gandalf and Pippin then\nhead for Minas Tirith in preparation for the upcoming war.\n\nChapters\n\n-   I - THE DEPARTURE OF BOROMIR - Aragorn finds Boromir hit with many\n    arrows, who tells him that orcs took Merry and Pippin, and that they\n    were still alive. Boromir dies, and his body is set down the stream\n    on a 'funeral boat'; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli decide to follow the\n    orcs who had captured Merry and Pippin, rather than following Frodo\n    and Sam. The three of them set off to chase the orcs.\n-   II - THE RIDERS OF ROHAN - They follow the trail of the orcs and\n    find several clues as to what happened with the hobbits, then meet a\n    company of Rohirrim led by Éomer, who tell them that the orcs were\n    destroyed and none were left alive. They camp near the site of the\n    orc massacre.\n-   III - THE URUK-HAI - This chapter begins further back in time,\n    telling the story of Merry and Pippin being captured by the orcs,\n    who are led by Ugluk from Saruman's army, and Grishnakh from Mordor.\n    The two sides of orcs are constantly arguing. The orcs camp near\n    Fangorn and Grishnakh attempts to take the hobbits away with him.\n    The hobbits escape as Grishnakh is killed by an arrow. They flee\n    into Fangorn Forest as the men of Rohan attack the orcs.\n-   IV - TREEBEARD - Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard the Ent, who calls\n    an Entmoot, a gathering of Ents in Derndingle. The hobbits meet\n    another ent, Quickbeam. After three days of deliberation, the ents\n    decide at the entmoot to attack Isengard.\n-   V - THE WHITE RIDER - The chapter goes back to the story of Aragorn,\n    Legolas and Gimli, who discover signs that the hobbits escaped the\n    orcs into the forest. They meet an old man, who they at first\n    presume to be Saruman, but who turns out to be Gandalf. They set off\n    for Edoras.\n-   VI - THE KING OF THE GOLDEN HALL - The four of them reach Edoras and\n    talk with King Theoden. Wormtongue is thrown out of the city.\n    Theoden gives Gandalf the horse Shadowfax.\n-   VII - HELM'S DEEP - Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are at Helm's Deep\n    with the Rohan army, defending the people of Rohan from attack by\n    the army of Saruman.\n-   VIII - THE ROAD TO ISENGARD - They travel to Isengard, and see that\n    it has been destroyed. At Isengard they find Merry and Pippin.\n-   IX - FLOTSAM AND JETSAM - Merry and Pippin tell the story of how the\n    ents attacked Isengard, in amongst the ruins or 'flotsam and jetsam'\n    of the city.\n-   X - THE VOICE OF SARUMAN - Saruman has a very persuasive voice,\n    which he almost uses to persuade Theoden and the others until\n    Gandalf casts him from the order of wizards. Wormtongue throws the\n    Palantír of Orthanc from the tower, which misses Gandalf, and is\n    picked up by Pippin.\n-   XI - THE PALANTIR - Pippin picks up the Palantír and is seen by\n    Sauron. Gandalf explains the origin of the Palantír; Gandalf sets\n    off with Pippin for Minas Tirith, riding on Shadowfax.\n\nBook IV: The Journey of the Ringbearers / The Ring Goes East\n\nFrodo and Sam discover Gollum stalking them as they try to reach Mount\nDoom to destroy the One Ring. Gollum hopes to reclaim the Ring. Sam\nloathes and distrusts him, but Frodo pities him. Gollum promises to lead\nthem to a secret entrance to Mordor and for a time appears to be a true\nally. They first stop at the Black gate of Mordor, where Gollum\npersuades them not to go in, where they would surely have been caught.\nThey head south into Ithilien, and are captured by Faramir, the brother\nof Boromir. Faramir learns from Frodo of his brother's death and the\nplan to destroy the ring, and eventually allows them to go on their way.\nGollum leads them into the lair of Shelob, an enormous spider-like\ncreature, who inflicts her poisonous bite on Frodo. Sam resolves to\nfinish the quest himself and takes the Ring. However, when Orcs take\nFrodo's body, he follows them and learns that Frodo is not dead but\nunconscious and now their prisoner. The last line of the book is “Frodo\nwas alive but taken by the enemy.”\n\nChapters\n\n-   I - THE TAMING OF SMEAGOL - Gollum joins Frodo and Sam, after Sam\n    captures him.\n-   II - THE PASSAGE OF THE MARSHES - They pass through the Dead\n    Marshes.\n-   III - THE BLACK GATE IS CLOSED - They reach the gate of Mordor,\n    Gollum persuades them not to go in, and they head south.\n-   IV - OF HERBS AND STEWED RABBIT - They reach the pleasant country of\n    Ithilien. Title refers to the rabbits Gollum catches that Sam cooks;\n    the smoke from the fire causes them to be seen by men of Gondor led\n    by Faramir, and they witness an attack on a Southron army, and an\n    Oliphaunt.\n-   V - THE WINDOW ON THE WEST - Frodo and Sam are captured by Faramir's\n    men and they are blindfolded on their way to Henneth Annûn. Frodo\n    and Faramir discuss Boromir's death.\n-   VI - THE FORBIDDEN POOL - Faramir shows Frodo they have found Gollum\n    at the Forbidden pool. Frodo saves him from being shot by Faramir's\n    men.\n-   VII - JOURNEY TO THE CROSS-ROADS - Frodo, Sam and Gollum leave\n    Faramir. They travel to the crossroad of the road east between\n    Osgiliath and Minas Morgul, and the north-south road from the Black\n    Gate to the southlands.\n-   VIII - THE STAIRS OF CIRITH UNGOL - They witness an army leaving\n    Minas Morgul.\n-   IX - SHELOB'S LAIR - encounter with Shelob the spider.\n-   X - THE CHOICES OF MASTER SAMWISE - Frodo is taken by the orcs. Sam\n    listens to the orcs talking about him, which is how he finds out\n    that he is still alive (he had thought that Shelob had killed\n    Frodo).\n\n\nAdaptations\n\nSome of the events of _The Two Towers_ were depicted in a 1978 film of\n_The Lord of the Rings_ by Ralph Bakshi and the 2002 _The Lord of the\nRings: The Two Towers_ by Peter Jackson. Both films abandoned the\nparallel storytelling of the book in favour of a more chronological\npresentation. The first chapter from the book actually appears at the\nend of Jackson's _The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring_.\nLater events of _The Two Towers_ were filmed for Jackson's _The Lord of\nthe Rings: The Return of the King_. Various games also adapt _The Two\nTowers_, including online role-playing games like _The Two Towers MUD_\nand graphically-oriented console games."

Tolkien's _The Lord of the Rings_, following _The Fellowship of the Ring_ and _The Two Towers_.\n\n\nTitle\n\n\n\nTolkien conceived of _The Lord of the Rings_ as a single volume\ncomprising six sections he called “books” and extensive appendices. The\noriginal publisher made the decision to split the work into three parts,\npublishing the fifth and sixth books and the appendices under the title\n_The Return of the King_, in reference to Aragorn's assumption of the\nthrone. Tolkien indicated he would have preferred _The War of the Ring_\nas a title, as it gave away less of the story.\n\n\nStructure\n\nThe structure of _The Return of the King_ mirrors somewhat that of _The\nTwo Towers_ in that the first section recounts the various adventures of\nseveral characters including a massive battle, and the second section\nresumes the quest of the Ring-bearers.\n\n\nContents\n\nBook V: The War of the Ring\n\nThe story begins as Gandalf delivers news to Denethor, the steward of\nGondor, that war is imminent. Gandalf brings Pippin with him, who enters\nthe service of the steward. Aragorn, by his courage and leadership,\nproves himself a worthy ruler of men. He is destined to find a lost army\nof men now dead yet entrapped in a curse set forth long ago by their own\ndisobedience, in the place known as the Paths of the Dead. The remnants\nof the Fellowship lead the forces of Gondor and Rohan in defence of\nGondor's capital city, Minas Tirith, resulting in the cataclysmic Battle\nof the Pelennor Fields. Those characters who manage to survive the\nbattle are led by Aragorn on an assuredly suicidal feint-attack against\nthe Black Gates of Mordor, partly to distract Sauron from defending his\nother borders so that Frodo and Sam can gain a clear passage into\nMordor. Aragorn's company now surrounds the Black Gates of the Morannon\nexchanging idle words with the Mouth of Sauron.\n\nChapters\n\n-   I - MINAS TIRITH - Gandalf and Pippin arrive in Minas Tirith; they\n    talk with Denethor; Pippin enters the service of the steward.\n-   II - THE PASSING OF THE GREY COMPANY - Follows Aragorn, Legolas and\n    Gimli as they pass through the Paths of the Dead between Rohan and\n    Gondor.\n-   III - THE MUSTER OF ROHAN - Rohan prepares for war; Merry heads off\n    for Minas Tirith, on a horse with a rider who calls himself\n    Dernhelm.\n-   IV - THE SIEGE OF GONDOR - Back to Gandalf and Pippin, and the\n    preparations of the city of Minas Tirith for the attack by the\n    armies of Mordor; Minas Tirith is besieged; chapter ends with the\n    gate of Minas Tirith broken, and the army of Rohan finally arriving.\n-   V - THE RIDE OF THE ROHIRRIM - The Rohirrim pass through the Druadan\n    Forest with the aid of the wild men who live there, who are led by\n    Ghan-buri-Ghan; the army arrives in Minas Tirith.\n-   VI - THE BATTLE OF THE PELENNOR FIELDS - Armies of Rohan and Gondor\n    fight the armies of Mordor, Rhun and Harad as described in Battle of\n    the Pelennor Fields; Merry and Eowyn together kill the chief of the\n    Nazgûl, the Witch-king of Angmar.\n-   VII - THE PYRE OF DENETHOR - Denethor goes mad and tries to burn\n    Faramir alive (believing him to be dead); he is saved by Gandalf;\n    Denethor then sets fire to himself. They discover that Denethor has\n    been using a Palantir.\n-   VIII - THE HOUSES OF HEALING - Merry, Faramir, Éowyn and many others\n    are injured and placed in the houses of healing; Aragorn uses\n    kingsfoil to help treat the injured.\n-   IX - THE LAST DEBATE - Gimli and Legolas meet Merry and Pippin\n    again; the captains of the west hold a counsel on their next action;\n    they decide to send 7000 men against Mordor to march on the Black\n    Gate.\n-   X - THE BLACK GATE OPENS - The army, with Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli,\n    Legolas and Pippin (but not Merry) marches to the Black Gate. The\n    Mouth of Sauron comes out to discuss terms, and presents tokens,\n    which were owned by Frodo; he then departs and the army of Mordor\n    attacks them.\n\nBook VI: The End of the Third Age/ The Return of the King\n\nIn the meanwhile, the brave and loyal Sam Gamgee (who for a short time\nhad himself become the ring-bearer) enables the long-suffering Frodo\nBaggins to navigate the barren wasteland of Mordor. For part of the way,\nthey are captured by a company of Orcs and must pretend to be orcs\nbefore they are able to escape. The company, tired and half-alive,\nfinally reaches the Crack of Doom, where the One Ring is destroyed along\nwith Gollum, freeing Middle-earth from Sauron's power forever. This\nhappens when Frodo at the last moment decides to keep the ring rather\nthan destroy it, and is attacked by Gollum who bites off Frodo's finger\nto take the ring, trips, and falls into the lava while still holding the\nring. Frodo and Sam are rescued by the giant eagles whom Gandalf rides\nto Mount Doom, from the black gates of Morannon. After Sauron is\ndefeated, his armies at the black gates flee, and the men of Gondor and\nRohan are victorious in the battle.\n\nAragorn is crowned King of Gondor at Minas Tirith. After a series of\ngoodbyes, the Hobbits return home, only to find the Shire under the\ncontrol of 'Sharkey' who they find out is Saruman, diminished in power\nbut not in malevolence. Merry and Pippin, now experienced warriors of\nRohan and Gondor respectively, take the lead in setting things right\nagain, and lead an uprising of hobbits against Saruman, freeing the\nshire.

    "text": "The ELVES, who called themselves the QUENDI, and who in lore are\ncommonly referred to as the '''Eldar '''(adj. _ELDARIN_), were the first\nand eldest of the Children of Ilúvatar, and are considered to be the\nfairest and wisest of any race of Arda given sapience.\n\nSome, known afterwards as the Calaquendi (Elves of the Light), were\nbrought by the Valar from Middle-earth to Valinor across the Sea, where\nthey were taught by the Ainur. But after the Silmarils were stolen by\nMelkor, some of the Elves returned to Middle-earth, where they remained\nuntil the end of the Third Age.\n\nElves do not physically age, and are not subject to illness. However,\nthey can be slain by violence or extreme negative emotion.\n\n\nHistory\n\nCreation and Awakening\n\n\n\nThe Firstborn, the Elder Children of Ilúvatar, were conceived by Eru\nalone in the third theme of Ainulindalë. They are the eldest and noblest\nof the speaking races of Middle-earth. They awoke at Cuiviénen, the\nWater of Awakening, in the far east of Middle-earth, in the starlight of\nthe Sleep of Yavanna, as the Sun and Moon had yet to be created. The\nfirst Elves to awake were three pairs: Imin (“First”) and his wife\nIminyë, Tata (“Second”) and Tatië, and Enel (“Third”) and Enelyë.\n\nAccording to legend, Imin, Tata, and Enel, and their wives joined up and\nwalked through the forests. They came across six, nine, and twelve pairs\nof elves, and each “patriarch” claimed the pairs as his folk in order.\nThe now sixty elves dwell by the rivers, and they invented poetry and\nmusic in Middle-earth. Journeying further, they came across a band of\nElves watching the stars, which Tata claims as his. These were tall and\ndark-haired, the fathers of most of the Ñoldor. The ninety-six elves now\ninvented many new words. Continuing their journey, they found\ntwenty-four pairs of elves, singing without language, and Enel added\nthem to his people. These were the ancestors of most of the Lindar or\n“singers”, later called Teleri. They found no more Elves; Imin's people,\nthe smallest group, were the ancestors of the Vanyar. All in all they\nnumbered 144. Because all elves had been found in groups of twelve,\ntwelve becomes their base number and 144 their highest number (for a\nlong time). None of the later Elvish languages had a common name for a\ngreater number.\n\nAt first the elves sang with grace and merriment without speech but soon\nthey developed speech and spoke with words, so their first name for\nthemselves was _Quendi_ (The Ones Who Speak With Voices).\n\nDiscovery and Sundering\n\nThe Elves were content and dwelt long under the stars of the forest near\nCuiviénen. However, Melkor, the Dark Lord, became aware of them and\ntheir location before the Valar, and during this time he sent evil\nspirits to spy on them and do them harm. Many of the spirits that\nharassed the Elves came in the form of great horsemen for the purpose of\ncausing the Elves to fear the Vala Oromë, whom Melkor knew would likely\nbe the first Vala to discover the Elves. And so it was that, on one of\nhis many journeys in the wilds of Middle-earth, Oromë came upon the\nElves. Due to Melkor's foresight and malice, some elves were afraid.\nHiding and fleeing, some of these early elves were taken by Melkor or\nhis agents. These elves were never seen again and were taken to Utumno,\nand were believed to be twisted and mutilated into the first Orcs.\nHowever, the Elves who stayed quickly learned that Oromë was far\ndifferent from the evils that had been pursuing them. Oromë quickly came\nto love the Elves, and them and gave them the name _Eldar_ (People of\nthe Stars).\n\nOromë spent some time with them and then returned to Valinor to tell\nManwë of his discovery. He then returned to live with elves for a time,\nlearning about them. Not long after, the Valar decided that, for the\ngood of the Elves, that Melkor needed to be overthrown. The Valar made\nwar upon Melkor and set a guard on Cuiviénen. The elves knew nothing of\nthe war save that the earth shook and thunderous lightning was seen in\nthe north. After a long, grievous war, the Valar were triumphant, and\nMelkor was imprisoned. Oromë then returned to the Elves with a summons\nof the Valar to Aman. However, many of the Elves were afraid, as they\nfelt and seen rumor of the terrible power of the Valar as they made war\nagainst Melkor. As such, the it was decided by the Elves to choose\nambassadors one from each kindred to go to Valinor and report back to\ntheir kindred what they saw. The names of these representatives were\nIngwë, Finwë, and Elwë.\n\nWhen the three returned, they spoke to their people of the beauty and\nbliss of what they had seen and urged them to travel to Valinor and\nabide there. Thus began the Great Journey, also known as the Sundering\nof the Elves. All of the elves agreed, save for the Avari, who chose to\nremain in Middle-earth. Led by Oromë, the elven kindreds marched out of\nCuiviénen but as they moved out of the forest area and saw the black\nclouds surrounding the north where Melkor had once lived, some grew\nafraid and turned back to Cuiviénen. The rest continued, albeit slowly,\noften stopping until Oromë returned, but were curious about what they\nsaw.\n\nThe Vanyar and the Ñoldor, who were most eager to reach Valinor pressed\non with the greatest speed and were the first to reach the coasts and to\nbe taken to Valinor on an island that the Vala Ulmo guided across the\nBelegaer. The Teleri were the slowest of the groups as they were drawn\nto what they had seen and encountered in the western and southern parts\nof Middle-earth. This caused them to separate into several different\ngroups, such as the Nandor who became Wood-elves of the Wilderland and\nlater the Beleriand. Some of the Teleri who did not like the seas and,\npartly due to the disappearance of Elwë in Nan Elmoth for a time, drew\nback and settled in the wooded areas of Region and Neldoreth that later\nbecame Doriath. The Teleri that were drawn to the sea settled along the\nwestern shores later becoming the Falathrim ruled by Círdan, who founded\nthe coastal cities of Eglarest and Brithombar. Eventually, most of the\nTeleri went into the west.\n\nLife in Aman\n\nThe elves that came to Aman were enriched by the knowledge of the Valar\nand the bliss of their lands, and the three Elven clans developed their\nown cultures. The former ambassadors Ingwë of the Vanyar and Finwë of\nthe Ñoldor became kings of their people and, as Elwë never returned to\nValinor, his brother Olwë became Lord of the Teleri. The Vanyar were\ndrawn to the Valar and the full light of the Two Trees of Valinor and\nsettled at the foot of Taniquetil with their king Ingwë, who became High\nKing of the Elves revered by all Elves living in the mountain below\nManwë. The Ñoldor, beloved by Aulë the Smith for their love of arts and\ncrafts, built the great city of Tirion on Túna where Finwë, the High\nKing of the Ñoldor, lived. The Teleri were drawn to sea and some never\nleft the island ferry of Tol Eressëa until Olwë their lord later built\nAlqualondë, with the help of the Ñoldor.\n\n\n\nThey developed writing and the arts of building, metallurgy, arts and\ncrafts, and shipbuilding. Things like high culture, poetry, and many of\nthe more subtle things were valued as well. For three ages, the Elves\nlived in total peace and bliss wandering the lands and beautifying its\nglory. Unfortunately, after three ages of imprisonment, Melkor completed\nhis sentence. He feigned rehabilitation, and convinced Manwë that he was\nno longer a threat. However, his stay in prison had only increased his\nmalice, and remembering that it was for the sake of the Elves that he\nhad been overthrown, he sought to poison the peace of Valinor and bring\nruin to the Elves. Adopting a fair and wise form, he began to cultivate\nthe trust of those living in Valinor. Of the three Elven clans, Melkor\nsaw the Teleri as being rather useless to him, and the Vanyar would have\nnothing to do with him, being content in their development. But the\nÑoldor, desiring more knowledge, were willing to listen to him, and\nMelkor saw that, due to their creative skill, they were more potentially\nuseful than the Teleri. And so Melkor began to teach them, and for a\nlong while none of his evil was made manifest, for any who sought his\naid and counsel benefited greatly from it. But with his genuine\nteachings came half-truths and disguised lies regarding the intentions\nof the Valar. Most harmful among these was the knowledge that Men, the\nSecond Children of Illuvatar, would one day appear in Middle-earth. The\nValar had not revealed this to the Elves, and after a time, rumors began\nto circulate amongst the Ñoldor that the Valar had brought them to Aman\nso that Men might inherit Middle-earth and usurp the glory that might\nhave belonged to the Elves. Chief amongst these discontented Elves was\nFëanor, the firstborn son of Finwë, King of the Ñoldor. Fëanor was\ngifted beyond virtually all of his peers in terms of beauty, skill,\nsubtlety, and craftsmanship. It was he who had developed, amongst many\nother wonders, the system of letters used by the Ñoldor. But his\ngreatest creation had been the Silmarils, three diamond-like gems in\nwhich the intermingled light of the Two Trees of Valinor had been\ncaptured.\n\nHowever, despite Fëanor's capabilities (or perhaps because of them), he\nwas exceedingly arrogant, and his actions were often rashly conducted.\nHe hated and feared Melkor, but unwittingly provided his lies with their\nmost prominent voice. Eventually, Melkor's lies and Fëanor's own vanity\nresulted in him drawing his sword against his half-brother Fingolfin.\nThe Valar had, up until this, been troubled by the unrest of the Ñoldor,\nbut had simply watched and waited. Now however, with the peace of\nValinor having been violated, they could no longer ignore the issue.\nFëanor was brought to Máhanaxar and told to explain himself. With this,\nthe lies of Melkor were at last laid bare, and he fled before the Valar\ncould recapture him. However, for his actions, Fëanor was banished from\nTirion for a time. Twelve years later, Manwë sought to heal the wounds\nbetween the Ñoldor at a festival held in Valmar, but Melkor and the\nGreat Spider Ungoliant destroyed the Two Trees, darkening Valinor,\nkilling Finwë, stealing the three Silmarils of Fëanor, and fleeing to\nMiddle-earth.\n\nRevolt of Ñoldor\n\nWhen the tragic death of his father became known, the wrath of Fëanor\ncould no longer be contained. He gathered all the Ñoldor in Tirion and\nbeneath the Tower of Mindon he urged the Ñoldor to return to\nMiddle-earth in pursuit of Melkor and the Silmarils swearing an oath to\nwar with Melkor, now known as Morgoth. After being banned by the Valar\nfor the rebellion and the violent deeds of the House of Fëanor, the\nÑoldor returned to Middle-earth as exiles to battle Morgoth, and to\nestablish and rule realms of their own.\n\nThe War of the Jewels\n\n\n\nThe crimes of Melkor in Aman and the subsequent rebellion of the Ñoldor\nstarted a centuries-long war that would come to involve all the Elven\nkindreds of Middle-earth, as well as other races, directly or\nindirectly. During this time, five great battles were fought against\nMorgoth and although many were victorious for the elves and their\nallies, the ultimate result was disastrous. Additionally, the doom that\nfollowed the Ñoldor as a result of the Kinslaying of Alqualondë was\ndiscovered by Thingol, the King of Doriath and High King of the Sindar.\nThis discovery all but destroyed the relationship between the Sindar and\nthe Ñoldor. There were also other elves and races such as the\nPetty-dwarves that resented the exiled Ñoldor for usurping their\nrightful place in Middle-earth.\n\nThough for hundreds of years, the Ñoldor elves fought and endured the\nforces of Morgoth with little military aid from the other Elven\nkindreds, a common fear and a common foe allowed for the Elves\n(especially the Ñoldor) to mingle with mortal Men, who had recently come\ninto the Beleriand from the east. The first of these were the Three\nHouses of the Edain. They were followed by the Easterlings, some of whom\nserved Morgoth. At first only the Ñoldor had dealings with Men, as the\nother elves feared them, but over the generations men served the Ñoldor\nand gained their respect. After the Quest for the Silmaril, the blood of\nthe Eldar and the Edain mingled with each other, first through the\nmarriage of Beren and Lúthien, and then through Tuor and Idril.\nThis union would create a bond that would enrich and ennoble both\nkindreds from then to later ages.\n\n\n\nThe terrible Oath of Fëanor created strife between the Elven kindreds,\nas even those not bound were drawn into it over the Silmaril recovered\nby Beren and Lúthien. The two brothers Celegorm and Curufin attempted to\nusurp the throne of Nargothrond after the loss of Finrod in the Quest\nfor the Silmaril, but were thwarted by the hound Huan and Orodreth and\nexpelled. It was because of this deed that the Ñoldor of Nargothrond\nlent little aid to the Union of Maedhros during the Nirnaeth\nArnoediad. Twice in the latter half of the First Age, the Sons tried\nto take the Silmaril from those who inherited it. These acts of cruelty\nand violence against their Elven kin caused great loss of life and\nresulted in the deaths of all of them except Maglor, who now wanders the\ncoasts of Middle-earth singing about the suffering of the Ñoldor.\n\nLater Days and Decline\n\n\n\nAfter the destruction of Beleriand in the War of Wrath, the remaining\nÑoldor repented of their rebellion and many returned to Eldamar along\nwith some of the Sindar. The elves that chose to remain in Middle-earth\nfounded peaceful realms. Most of the Ñoldor lived in Lindon with\nGil-galad, the High King of the Ñoldor. Hundreds of years later\nCelebrimbor, the last of the House of Fëanor, founded a new Ñoldorin\nrealm called Eregion. The Sindar joined also with Gil-galad in Lindon\nand few went beyond the Misty Mountains into Wilderland, becoming\nleaders of the Silvan Elves in places such as Lothlórien and Greenwood\nthe Great.\n\nThe Elven realms flourished for over one thousand years until SA 1200\nwhen Sauron, under the guise of a messenger from the Valar, appeared out\nof the East to offer knowledge to the elves. Gil-galad mistrusted him\nand barred him from his kingdom. Sauron then approached Celebrimbor and\nthe Elves of Eregion, and against Gil-galad's advice they accepted him\nand his knowledge. With Annatar's help, Celebrimbor forged the Rings of\nPower, but Three Rings alone were made in secret by Celebrimbor and were\nnot directly touched by Sauron's power. Then, Sauron forged the One Ring\nin order to control the others. The elves discovered Sauron's plan and\ntook off their rings. Celebrimbor sent the ring Nenya to Galadriel and\nsent Vilya and Narya to Gil-galad in Lindon.\n\n\n\nFurious that the elves had foiled his plans for domination, Sauron\ndemanded the return of the rings and when they refused he prepared for\nwar. For eight years, Sauron laid waste to Middle-earth in his war\nagainst the Elves, destroying Eregion and killing Celebrimbor.\nEventually, with help of the Númenóreans, Gil-galad was able to lead the\nelves to victory. Gil-galad then decided to abandon Eregion in favor of\nthe new refuge of Rivendell formed at the foothills of the Misty\nMountains and he made his herald, Elrond, the Lord of Rivendell and his\nrepresentative in Eriador. Lindon survived still as the greatest kingdom\nof elves in Middle-earth. The rest of the elves of Middle-earth who\nsurvived either moved to Lindon, sailed for the West, or continued to\nlive in their lands under caution due to the continued threat from\nSauron.\n\nBy the latter half of the Second Age, Men continued to spread and grow\nin Middle-earth. The Faithful from the Downfall of Númenór founded the\ngreat mannish kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor. Though Men were set to\nsupplant them in Middle-earth, the Elves were powerful and numerous\nenough to join with Men one last time to defeat Sauron. Gil-galad led\nthe second greatest host of elves ever seen in Arda and formed the Last\nAlliance with Elendil, High King of all Dúnedain, and vanquished Sauron\nin SA 3441.\n\nWith the Dominion of Men at hand, the Elves became less numerous and\nmore secluded with many becoming wearier of the now mortal lands. Only\nthe realms of Lindon, Lothlórien, and Rivendell survived as havens of\nElven bliss. High Elves continued to live in Lindon but most sailed into\nthe West after their king's death. The last of the High Elves left\nMiddle-earth after the final defeat of Sauron in the War of the\nRing.\n\n\n\nBeing immortal, Elves will continue to live in the world until its\ncompletion. Elves living in Aman live in a state of blissful happiness\nas they did before the Revolt of the Ñoldor. Elves that never chose to\nsail into Utter West instead choosing to remain in Middle-earth in\nplaces such as the Woodland Realm in the former Mirkwood, would probably\nbecome more and more secretive, less numerous, and hidden. Eventually,\nthese Lingerers would fade away entirely as their bodies were consumed\nby the power of their spirits. Now, in the sixth/seventh age, they are\nnothing more than empty souls, invisible and with no real conscience.\n\n\nSunderings\n\n\n\nWhen the elves were first summoned to Aman by the Valar, they became\ndivided into two groups - the Eldar (Quenya Tengwar: full spelling or\nvowel-abbreviated spelling ; IPA: ; singular ELDA; ; adjectival ELDARIN;\nor ; ), who accepted the summons of the Valar and undertook the Great\nJourney, and the Avari, who refused the summons and became the lesser\nelves. The elves flourished in the First Age, but the Eldarin realms of\nBeleriand were destroyed by Morgoth, and in later ages their power\nwaned. In the Second and Third Ages some Elves still lived in Wandering\nCompanies, traveling through the broad lands they loved, but many were\ngathered in Elven-realms and refuges such as Lindon, Rivendell, the\nWoodland Realm, and Lorien, where Sindar and Ñoldor lords ruled over\nSilvan populations. By the end of the Third Age the Dominion of Men was\nat hand, and the elves who remained in Middle-earth dwindled and became\na secret people. Yet in Eldamar the Eldar live nigh to the Valar until\nthe End of the World.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nElves, like Men, are Children of Eru Ilúvatar and thus are very similar\nto Men. Unlike Men, however, they are immortal, in that their bodies do\nnot age once they have reached maturity, so that they do not seem to\nbecome elderly or die of old age. They can be killed by physical injury\nhowever, or they may come to death from wasting away if after long eons\nof life they lose the will to live. Some Elves in the First Age living\nnear Angband died from a wasting disease, which was presumably issuing\nfrom Thangorodrim, Morgoth's fortress. The Elves came into existence\nbefore Men, and when Elves die they pass to the Halls of Mandos in\nValinor. After a long period of waiting, the Elf (unless unwilling to\nreturn to life or judged a perpetrator of unforgivable crimes) will be\nreincarnated.\n\nFor Elves, sex and marriage are one and the same, and it is that bodily\nunion that achieves marriage. Elves lose interest in sex after they've\nhad children. They do not consider the day a child was born as the\nmoment they came into existence. Instead, they celebrate the day the\nchild's parents begat them. Elves come of age at around fifty years old,\nand generally marry around this age. Elves who marry late or never are\nsaid to have strange fates. Elves can tell in the eyes and voice of\nanother Elf whether they are married, and it is against an Elf's nature\nto take another by force; one so forced would reject bodily life and\ndie. Because of the union of souls that occurs when Elves marry, and\nbecause of the eternal nature of Elven souls, they do not divorce or\nhave multiple marriages. Elves have a taboo against incest, but marriage\namong second cousins is seen as acceptable. Whether this results in\ndegradation from strong bloodlines is unknown.\n\nElves are (generally) unusually beautiful of face and body. There is\nlittle physical difference between males and females except that which\nis required for reproduction. They have far better vision and\nhearing than Men. They also have skills and abilities beyond what is\npossible for Men, and many can craft seemingly magical objects. In _The\nSilmarillion_, it is mentioned that the Elves are indeed closest in kin\nto the Ainur, given that Elves possess ethereal grace and various\npowers. Elves are light of foot, can travel long distances without\nleaving tracks, and often can walk lightly across snow where the boots\nof Men would sink. They do not require sleep, but are able to enter\na waking meditative state to regain their strength which means they can\nbe exhausted and tire. Although the Elves are more resistant to\nadverse environments and lack of food than Men, they can succumb to them\nthus Elves do require sustenance."

    "text": "_'Men (THAT IS, Atani_') were one of several races inhabiting Arda. They\nare the HUMANS of Middle-earth, and the second of the Children of\nIlúvatar.\n\n\nOrigins\n\nThe race of Men was the second significant race of beings created by the\nsupreme God, Ilúvatar, since they awoke at the start of the First Age,\nat the first rising of the Sun (FA 1), while the elves awoke three Ages\nbefore them. They were called the “AFTERBORN” (Quenya _Atani_, Sindarin:\n_EDAIN_) by the Elves.\n\nMen bear the _Gift of Men_, which is mortality, and therefore they age\nand die when their time comes, and are susceptible to illness and\ndisease. Elves are immortal, in the sense that they are not susceptible\nto aging and disease. Even if their bodies are slain, their spirits will\nremain bound to the world for as long as it lasts, and pass to the Halls\nof Mandos to wait until they are released or the world ends.\n\n\nTerms\n\nThe Elves called the race of Men (in Quenya) _Atani_, meaning “Second\nPeople”, but also _HILDOR_ (Aftercomers), and _FÍRIMAR_ (Mortals) or\n_ENGWAR_ (the sickly).  They were also called the Usurpers, the\nStrangers, the inscrutable, the Self-cursed, the Heavyhanded, the\nNightfearers and THE CHILDREN OF THE SUN.  The name _Atani_ became\n_EDAIN_ in Sindarin, but this term was later applied only to those Men\nwho were friendly to the Elves.\n\nTerms used in the First Age to refer to Men who were not Edain were\n_RHEVAIN_ and ''HRAVANI,''' ''_'which both translate to 'the Wild'. The\n“Black Men” and the “Swarthy Men” (who would become known as the\n_Haradrim_ and the _Easterlings__, ''respectively) were both held to be\nethnicities of this distinction.\n\n\nGroups and alignments\n\nAlthough all Men of Middle-earth were related to one another, there were\nmany different sunderings and cultures. The most important group in the\ntales of the First Age were the Edain. Although the word Edain refers to\nall Men, the Elves use it to distinguish those Men who fought with them\nin the First Age against Morgoth in Beleriand from others.\n\nThose Men who fought with them against Morgoth in the First Age were\ndivided into three Houses. The First House of the Edain was the House of\nBëor, and entered Beleriand in FA 305 and were granted the fief of\nLadros in Dorthonion by Finrod Felagund. The Second House of the Edain,\nthe Haladin was led by Haldad, and later by his daughter, Haleth, and\nsettled in the Forest of Brethil. The Third House, which became the\ngreatest, was led by Marach, and later his descendant, Hador, and they\nsettled in Dor-lómin. This house was known both as the House of Marach\nand the House of Hador.\n\nOther Men didn't cross the Misty Mountains or fight against Morgoth.\nSome, such as the Easterlings, fought openly on his side. Later on, the\nHaradrim would fight on Sauron's side against the descendants of the\nEdain. Below follow short descriptions of the most important groups of\nMen in the First, Second, and Third ages.\n\nEdain and Dúnedain\n\n\n\nFor their services and assistance rendered to the Elves and the Valar in\nthe War of Wrath at the end of the First Age, the Edain were rewarded\nwith a new land of their own between Middle-earth and the Undying Lands.\nThis was the island of Númenor, an island far away from the evil of\nMiddle-earth.\n\nThe Edain were led to this island by Elros with the help of his father\nEärendil, who sailed the heavens as the bright star of the same name.\nOnce there Elros became the first king of Númenor as Tar-Minyatur and\nthe Edain became known as the Dúnedain (Sindarin for _Men of the West_).\nThe kingdom of Númenor grew steadily in power and the Dúnedain became\nthe noblest and highest of all Men on Arda. Allied to the Elves, Númenor\nfought against Morgoth's lieutenant Sauron.\n\nNow that the Men of the West had become powerful they came to resent the\nGift of Men, Death. They wanted to become immortal like the Elves, and\nenjoy their accumulated power for all time. The Númenóreans turned away\nfrom the Valar, began to call the Gift of Men the _Doom of Men_ and\ncursed the Ban of the Valar which forbade them to sail west beyond sight\nof Númenor or to enter Valinor. In SA 2899 Ar-Adûnakhôr became the first\nking of Númenor who took his royal name in Adûnaic, the language of Men\ninstead of Quenya, the language of the Elves. This led to civil war in\nNúmenor.\n\nThe people of Númenor were divided into two factions: the KING'S MEN,\nwho enjoyed the support of the King and the majority of the people. They\nfavoured Adûnaic as language. The minority faction, the FAITHFUL, were\nled by the lord of Andúnië, the westernmost province of Númenor, and\nfavoured Quenya. Sauron who by the second millennium of the Second Age\nwas nearly defeated by the Elves and Numenoreans, took advantage of the\ndivision. He surrendered to the last Númenórean King, Ar-Pharazôn and\nworked his way into the King's counsels. Ultimately, Sauron advised him\nto attack Valinor and claim immortality. This he foolishly did, and as a\npunishment Númenor, the island of the Men of the West fell and only the\nFaithful escaped and founded the twin kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor.\n\nBlack Númenóreans and Haradrim\n\nBefore the fall of Númenor, however, as it was growing in naval power,\nmany Númenóreans sailed east and founded colonies in Middle-earth. In\nthe second millennium of the Second Age there was an exodus of Men from\novercrowded Númenor. The King's Men migrated because they wanted to\nconquer more lands, and the Faithful because they were persecuted by the\nKings. The Faithful settled in Pelargir and the King's Men settled in\nUmbar. When Númenor was destroyed the King's Men became known as the\nBlack Númenóreans and remained hostile against the Faithful of Gondor.\nFrom their ranks Sauron recruited the kings who would become the nine\nRingwraiths in the second millennium of the Second Age. Umbar was\nconquered by Gondor in TA 933.\n\nAmong the Black Númenórean race was the wicked Queen Berúthiel, wife of\nTarannon Falastur, King of Gondor.\n\nFurther east of Umbar another group of Men lived, the HARADRIM. They\nwere dark skinned Men and waged war on great Oliphaunts or _Mûmakil_.\nHostile to Gondor, they were subdued in TA 1050 by Hyarmendacil I.\n\nBoth Umbar and the Harad were left unchecked by Gondor's waning power by\nthe time of the War of the Ring, and presented grave threats from the\nsouth. Many Haradrim fought with Sauron's forces in Gondor in that War.\n\n    _See also_: Southrons\n\nCORSAIRS Pirates who hail from the havens of Umbar are masters of the\nsea and ships. Although they were due to fight for Sauron in the Battle\nof the Pelennor Fields, they were mysteriously delayed and their ships\nwere hijacked by the Dead Men of Dunharrow. After the fall of Sauron,\nthe corsairs were not even punished by the West because they were\nmercenaries.\n\nVARIAGS Although Variags do not appear in the films, it is confirmed\nthat they came from Khand, south of Rhun . They were excellent horsemen\nand, like the Easterlings, they had wains. They had brown skin and\nhandlebar mustaches and chest-length beards.\n\nEasterlings\n\n\n\nMost of the Men who fought in the armies of Morgoth and Sauron were\nEasterlings, who came from the region around the Sea of Rhûn. Some\nEasterlings offered their services to the elvish kingdoms in Beleriand,\namong them were BÓr and his sons and Ulfang the Black and his sons. This\nproved to be disastrous for the Free Peoples in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad\nwhen Ulfang and his clan switched sides and defected to Morgoth, while\nBor and his sons died bravely fighting on the side of the Elves.\n\nAfter Morgoth's defeat Sauron extended his influence over the\nEasterlings and although Sauron was defeated by the Last Alliance of\nElves and Men at the end of the Second Age, the Easterlings were the\nfirst enemies to attack Gondor again in TA 492. They were soundly\ndefeated by King Rómendacil I, but invaded again in TA 541 and took\nrevenge by slaying King Rómendacil. Rómendacil's son Turambar took large\nportions of land from them. In the next centuries Gondor held sway over\nthe Easterlings. When Gondor's power began to decrease in the twelfth\ncentury Third Age, the Easterlings took the complete eastern bank of the\nAnduin except Ithilien crushing Gondor's allies, the Northmen.\n\nThe Easterlings of the Third Age were divided in different tribes, such\nas the Wainriders and the Balchoth. The Wainriders were a confederation\nof Easterlings which were very active between TA 1856 and TA 1944. They\nwere a serious threat to Gondor for many years, but were utterly\ndefeated by Eärnil IIin1944. When Gondor lost its royal dynasty in TA\n2050 the Easterlings started to reorganize themselves and a fierce tribe\ncalled the Balchoth became the most important tribe. In TA 2510 they\ninvaded Gondor again and conquered much of Calenardhon, until they were\ndefeated by the Éothéod, coming to Gondor's aid.\n\nUntil the War of the Ring, the Easterlings didn't launch any further\ninvasion. During the War of the Ring, they were amongst the fiercest\nwarriors deployed at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields by Sauron\nhimself.\n\nNorthmen\n\n\n\nThe Northmen were composed of two principal groups. First, not all the\nMen who remained east of the Blue Mountains and Misty Mountains were\ntempted by Morgoth or Sauron. They were joined after the War of Wrath by\nthose of the Edain who did not wish to travel to Númenór (similar to\nhow, at the end of the first age, various eldar remained and went east,\nbecoming lords of the silvan elves). The Northmen who dwelt in Greenwood\nthe Great and other parts of Rhovanion were friendly to the Dúnedain,\nbeing for the most part their kin, and many of them became Gondorian\nsubjects. The Men of Dale and Esgaroth were Northmen, as were the\nWoodmen of Mirkwood, and the Éothéod, who became the Rohirrim.\n\nDunlendings and Drúedain\n\n\n\nWhen Elendil founded the Kingdom of Arnor its borders were quickly\nextended towards the river Greyflood (Sind:_Gwathló_), and Gondor\nlikewise extended up through Enedwaith. In Enedwaith (Middle-land) and\nMinhiriath (Sindarin for _Land between the Rivers_) lived a group of Men\nrelated to those Men that became the House of Haleth, and they were\nknown as the Dunlendings. They had lived in the great woods that covered\nmost of Eriador, and when the Númenóreans started to chop these woods\ndown to build their ships in the Second Age, the Dúnedain of Númenor\nearned the hostility of the Dunlendings. The Dunlendings later became\nbitter enemies of Rohan. The Dunlendings served Saruman in the War of\nthe Ring and participated in the Battle of the Hornburg.\n\nAnother group of Men were the Woses or Druedain. They were small and\nbent compared to other Men. The Woses had brown to black skin. They\nlived among the House of Haleth in the First Age, and were held as Edain\nby the Elves, who called them _Drúedain_ (from _Drûg_, their own name\nfor themselves, plus _Edain_). At the end of the Third Age some Woses\nlived in the Drúadan forest, small in number but experienced in wood\nlife. They held off orcs with poisoned arrows and were vital in securing\nthe aid of the Rohirrim in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. King\nElessar granted the Drúadan Forest “forever” to them in the Fourth Age.\n\n\nNotable Men\n\nFirst Age\n\n-   Beren, son of Barahir\n-   Bëor the Old\n-   Haleth, daughter of Haldad\n-   Hador, son of Hathol\n-   Galdor, son of Hador\n-   Húrin, son of Galdor\n-   Túrin Turambar, son of Húrin\n-   Tuor, son of Huor\n\nSecond Age\n\n-   Elros Tar-Minyatur, son of Eärendil (Half-elven)\n-   Elendil, son of Amandil\n-   Isildur, son of Elendil\n-   Anárion, son of Elendil\n-   Tar-Minastir, the eleventh King of Númenor\n-   Ar-Pharazôn the Golden, the last King of Númenor\n\nThird Age\n\n-   Bard the Bowman, slayer of the dragon Smaug and king of Dale\n-   Hyarmendacil I, son of Ciryandil, perhaps the greatest king Gondor\n    has had until Elessar\n-   Aragorn II Elessar, son of Arathorn\n-   Denethor II, and his sons Boromir and Faramir\n-   Boromir, son of Denethor II\n-   Faramir, son of Denethor II\n-   Théoden, son of Thengel\n-   Éomer, nephew and heir of Théoden, and his sister Éowyn\n-   Gríma Wormtongue, counsellor of Edoras\n-   Mouth of Sauron, Lieutenant of Barad-dûr"

    "text": "DWARVES were a race in Middle-earth also known as the KHAZAD, the\nNAUGRIM (meaning 'STUNTED PEOPLE'), and '''Gonnhirrim '''(meaning\n'MASTERS OF STONE').\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n\nCreation\n\n\n\nThe Dwarves were made by Aulë, whom they themselves call Mahal, meaning\n“maker.” Aulë was unwilling to wait for the coming of the Children of\nIlúvatar, for he was impatient and desired to have someone to teach his\nlore and crafts. Therefore, he made the first Seven Fathers of the\nDwarves in secret in a hall under the mountains of Middle-earth.\n\nIt was, however, not within Aulë's power to create life. After being\nreprimanded by Ilúvatar and realizing his error, Aulë offered his\ncreations to his father to do with as he would, including their\ndestruction. Even as the offer was made, Ilúvatar accepted and gave the\nDwarves a life of their own. So when Aulë picked up a great hammer to\nsmite the Seven Fathers and destroy his presumptuous creations, they\nshrank back in fear and begged for mercy.\n\nIlúvatar was however not willing to suffer that the Dwarves should come\nbefore the Firstborn (Elves), and he decreed that the Seven Fathers\nshould sleep underground and should not come forth until the Firstborn\nhad awakened.\n\nFirst Age\n\nAbout a century after the Elves awakened, the Seven Fathers of the\nDwarves were roused. Of those seven, only the name of one is known,\nDurin I, who was called the deathless. Each one of the seven fathers\nbecame a king of his own clan, and each built his own great hall. Three\nmajor holds are known to have been built in the First Age. Belegost and\nNogrod were built in the Blue Mountains, and the Dwarves of these holds\nformed alliances with the Ñoldor and fought in their wars. Durin I, on\nthe other hand, wandered into a vale in the Misty Mountains he named\nAzanulbizar. In a still pool in that vale, he saw a reflection of\nhimself with a crown of seven stars. Ever after, the constellation of\nstars that the Elves call Valacirca was called by the Dwarves Durin’s\nCrown, and it could be seen reflected in the water at any time of the\nday, though only Durin could see his own reflection. Durin I named the\nlake Kheled-zâram and proceeded to build his great hall, Khazad-dûm, in\nthe mountains above. In the First Age, the Dwarves made alliances with\nthe Elves, and both prospered from trade. Dwarves from Belegost invented\nthe famous Dwarf-mail of linked rings and fashioned the finest steel the\nworld had ever seen. They also constructed the hall of Thingol,\nMenegroth, and were rewarded with the pearl Nimphelos. They fought\nalongside Elves and Men and participated in some of the major battles of\nthe First Age, including The First Battle of Beleriand and the Nirnaeth\nArnoediad in which the Dwarves of Belegost won great renown for being\nthe only ones able to stand against the dragon Glaurung, for 'it was\ntheir custom moreover to wear great masks in battle hideous to look\nupon', which 'set them good stead against dragons', and besides they\nwere 'naturally able to resist fire better than elves or men'. In that\nbattle, Azaghâl the Lord of Belegost was killed by Glaurung, who crawled\nover him. Before dying, the dwarf stabbed at the dragon's belly with his\nknife and 'pricked him so deep that he fled back to Angband'.\n\nThe Dwarves of Nogrod were famous for the craftsmanship of their\nweapons. Most notable amongst their smiths was Telchar. Dwarves from\nNogrod crafted the necklace Nauglamír, and Thingol requested Dwarven\nsmiths from Nogrod to set a Silmaril into that necklace. Thus were\nunited the greatest works of Elves and Dwarves. Those Dwarf-smiths were\ndriven mad by gold-lust, however, and murdered Thingol and stole the\nnecklace and the stone, igniting the bitter rivalry between Dwarves and\nElves that would rage between the two races until the end of the Third\nAge.\n\nThe Elves of Doriath pursued the smiths to their deaths and reclaimed\nNauglamír. But two of the slayers of Thingol escaped from the pursuit\nand in Nogrod told how Dwarves were slain by command of the Elven-king,\nwho thus would cheat them of their just reward. The Dwarves of Nogrod\nlamented the deaths of their kin and their great craftsmen and took\nthought of vengeance. Though the Dwarves of Belegost tried to dissuade\nthem from their purpose, the Dwarves of Nogrod invaded Doriath. After a\nhard battle in the Thousand Caves, the Dwarves of Nogrod were victorious\nand took Nauglamír and the Silmaril. On their return journey to the Blue\nMountains, however, the Dwarves of Nogrod were assailed by a company\nthat included Beren, his son Dior, and many Green-elves of Ossiriand.\nMany of the Dwarves were slain, and Beren himself slew the Lord of\nNogrod and wrested from him the necklace Nauglamír. Some of the Dwarves\nescaped from the battle, but they were ambushed in the slopes beneath\nMount Dolmed by the Shepherds of the Trees.\n\nSome stories from the first age tell of petty Dwarves who were called\nNoegyth Nibin. Those were Dwarves exiled from their homes during the\nPeace of Arda and were the first Dwarves to enter Beleriand. It was\npetty Dwarves who first inhabited and carved out The Caverns of Narog,\nwhich they called Nulukkizdîn, but were later taken over by Finrod and\ncalled Nargothrond. The last of this line were Mîm and his two sons who\nlived at Amon Rûdh. Mîm aided Túrin in his adventures, but subsequently\nbetrayed him to Orcs.\n\nSecond Age\n\n\n\nAfter the First Age most tales telling of Dwarves are about the Dwarves\nof the line of Durin, who are commonly called Durin’s Folk or\nLongbeards. Durin I enjoyed a very long life and lived through most of\nthe First Age. Every now and then through the following ages a Dwarf was\nborn of this line that was so alike to Durin that he was considered to\nbe Durin reborn. Prophecy told that Durin would be reborn seven times\nand the coming of Durin VII would mark the decline of the Dwarves.\n\nDurin II was born in the Second Age. It is not known exactly when, but\nhe was in power when the smith Narvi built the west gate of Khazad-dûm\nin the year 750. His reign was an era of great prosperity in which the\nhalls of Khazad-dûm were greatly expanded and the Noldorin Elves of\nLindon moved into Eregion to trade with the Dwarves for mithril.\nPopulation boomed because many refugees from Belegost and Nogrod, which\nwere destroyed at the end of the First Age, moved to Khazad-dûm.\n\nDurin III was in power around the year 1600 of the Second Age. He was\ngifted with the seventh and most powerful of the Dwarven Rings of Power.\nIt was the Elven smith Celebrimbor and not Sauron who gave him the ring.\nThe rings of power did not have the effects that Sauron had intended,\npossibly because Aulë had made the Dwarves especially resistant to evil\ndomination. The only apparent effect of the Dwarven rings was that the\nDwarves became more greedy with gold lust, but they were not turned into\nwraiths like men. Sauron tried to recover the rings. Two he reclaimed\nfairly soon and four ended up in dragon hoards. Sauron did not reclaim\nthe ring of Durin until the 2845th year of the Third Age when he\ncaptured Thráin II.\n\nOf the Dwarves, few fought upon either side; but the kindred of Durin of\nMoria fought against Sauron.\n\nThird Age\n\nIn Third Age 1980, after centuries of greedy digging for _mithril_ and\nother minerals, the Dwarves woke a Balrog that was sleeping in the deeps\nof the Misty Mountains since the First Age. The Dwarves fled Khazad-dum,\nwhich from then on was called _Moria_, which means “Black pit”.\n\nMost of Durin's folk left for the Grey Mountains in the North, while\nsome followed the new king, Thráin I, who briefly went to Erebor. For\nmore than 300 years the Dwarves of the Grey Mountains prospered until\nthe Dragons in the far North started to gain strength. Some fled to the\nIron Hills, while most followed the new king Thrór to Erebor to start a\nnew Kingdom under the Mountain. There, they prospered for over 200 years\nuntil the dragon Smaug descended in TA 2770. The King and his company\nwent in exile South, while most of the survivors went to the Iron Hills.\n\nDurin's folk settled in Dunland, and King Thrór traveled North to Moria\nwhere he was killed by the Goblin king Azog. Thrór's son Thráin II (who\nhad received the Last of the Seven Rings from his father before his\ndeparture) summoned all the Houses of Dwarves to war. Thus began the War\nof Dwarves and Orcs, in which the Dwarves destroyed all the Goblin\nstrongholds in the Misty Mountains culminating to the great Battle of\nAzanulbizar where all the dwarven clans united. The Goblin hosts issuing\nfrom Moria were strong and relentless until the arrival of fresh Dwarves\nof the Iron Hills. The Battle ended with the victory of Dwarves, but at\ngreat cost. The Dwarven clans however were unwilling to repopulate\nMoria. Thráin therefore came to the Blue Mountains and established his\nrealm there.\n\nThe Wizard Gandalf was instrumental into helping Thráin's son Thorin in\nreclaiming the Kingdom of Erebor. Thorin gathered around him twelve\ndwarves, mostly from his own line, and was joined by Gandalf and Bilbo\nBaggins. The Quest of Erebor ended with the death of Smaug. After a\nquarrel with the Men and Elves over the unguarded hoard, the Dwarves -\nassisted by those from the Iron Hills - united with the Men and Elves to\nfight the attacking Goblins and Wargs, in what was called the Battle of\nFive Armies, where Thorin was killed.\n\nGimli son of Glóin joined the Fellowship of the Ring as a representative\nof the Dwarves and befriended Legolas during the War of the Ring. After\nthe Battle of the Pelennor Fields, a force of 30,000 Longbeards and\n20,000 Men of Dale held the Lonely Mountain in a similar siege against\n200,000 Men of Rhun who had taken all of Brand's lands, leaving only his\ncapital city of Dale. The Dwarves and Men of Dale stood for three days\nagainst the Easterlings, and once the news of Sauron's death spread to\nthe Lonely Mountain the Easterlings retreated, having lost over 100,000\ntroops, as opposed to the defenders who lost 14,000 Dwarves and 12,000\nMen. The sturdy nature of the Mountain Rock, combined with the Dwarven\nmasonry and the Dwarven quality of the defenders' weapons, reduced the\nhitting power of the Easterlings' two-armed catapults and semi-automatic\nballistas, and allowed the defenders to drive the attackers from the\nMountain and out of Brand's realm.\n\nAfter the Third Age\n\nDuring the Fourth Age, which began after the destruction of Mordor and\nSauron, Dwarves and Men re-forged their friendship. Dáin was killed\nduring the War of the Ring, and was succeeded by his son Thorin III\nStonehelm who ruled well into the Fourth Age. During this time, Dwarves\nfrom the Lonely Mountain helped rebuild cities in Gondor and the\nfortress of Helm's Deep, and some went to the newly established Dwarven\nrealm of the Glittering Caves where Gimli was lord. Nevertheless, the\nKingdom of the Lonely Mountain apparently continued to prosper\nthroughout the Fourth Age.\n\nFourth Age\n\nNot much is known about the Dwarves in the Fourth Age. After the War of\nthe Ring, Gimli brought a part of Durin's Folk from the Lonely Mountain\nto the Glittering Caves behind Helm's Deep and founded a colony there.\nSubsequently, Gimli went on many travels with his friend Legolas, and\nHistory lost track of their fate. Through their friendship and\ninfluence, the feud between the two races that had lasted for millennia\nfinally ended, shortly before the departure of the last Elves from\nMiddle-earth. It is rumored that Gimli and Legolas eventually boarded a\nship that sailed down the river Anduin, out to sea and across to Valinor\nin the year FO 120. Gimli would thus have become the only Dwarf to ever\nbe permitted to cross to the Undying Lands.\n\nDue to the diminished states of dragons and orcs, dwarves may have been\nable to reclaim their ancient kingdoms such as Gundabad and the Grey\nMountains.\n\nDurin VII (the Last), retook Moria and brought Khazad-dûm back to its\noriginal splendor, and the Longbeards lived there till the “world grew\nold and the days of Durin's race ended.” \n\n\nCulture\n\nAppearance\n\n\n\nWhen Aulë created the Dwarves he had only a vague idea of what the\nChildren of Ilúvatar should look like. Because of the threat of Morgoth\nover the world, Aulë made them very strong, both in body and character.\n\nDwarves were a short, stocky race, a little taller than hobbits but much\nbroader and heavier. Most Dwarves had thick, luxuriant beards in which\nthey took great pride, and often forked or braided them and tucked them\ninto their belts.\n\n\n\nThey seem to have favoured simple durable clothing, coloured hoods and\nheavy cloaks for travelling, and belts of gold or silver. For battle\ntheir soldiers would have elaborately crafted armor and helmets, bearing\nvarious angles and styles that were trademarks of Dwarven crafting\nstyles. Their armor was masked with symbols (after the manner of those\nused in forges for shielding the eyes) that were hideous to look upon.\n\n\n\nDwarven women were alike in manner, voice and appearance to their\nmenfolk. They were few in number, less than a third of all dwarf-kind,\nand they were seldom seen outside their own halls, often not venturing\nfar due to their duties as caretakers and crafters in Dwarven society.\nThey typically only travelled when in great need, and they usually\ndressed similarly to Dwarf men. This often led other folk to believe\nthere were no women among the Dwarves, that Dwarves grew from stone when\ncreated. Few female Dwarven warriors were known, but some tales say that\nfemale Dwarves were as fierce as their male counterparts, especially in\nprotecting their families and offspring. Dwarves were usually\nmonogamous, and fewer than one-third of Dwarven men took a wife, the\nrest busying themselves with their crafts.\n\nPhysiology\n\n\n\nDwarves were a proud and stern race and were made to be sturdy to resist\nthe dangers of their time. They were physically very strong, had great\nendurance, especially in the ability to resist heat and cold, and they\nmade light of heavy burdens. Dwarves lived longer than Men, often up\nto two hundred and fifty years. The Dwarven lords of the First and\nSecond Age may have lived for several hundred years. Dwarves had the\nability to learn new artisanal skills quickly, especially those dealing\nwith metal or stone.\n\nDwarves were typically stubborn, secretive, and fiercely loyal to their\nfriends. They cared greatly about mining, crafting, crafts, gold and\ngems, their acquisition of which often fueled the envy of the Elves.\nDwarves were easily offended by rude comments, and had a propensity to\nhold long-lasting grudges. Dwarves were often seen as greedy, but their\nnature gave them resistance to many external influences, including to\nthe evil of the Rings of Power given them. Whereas the Men who owned the\nnine Rings were corrupted and became the Nazgûl, the Dwarves were\nunaffected, save by an increase of their goldlust and hatred for\nanything that stood between them and what they perceived as their\ntreasure.\n\nCrafting\n\nDwarves were taught special skills by the Vala Aulë and spent most of\ntheir time crafting, smithing and mining in their massive underground\ncities.\n\nThe Dwarves were some of the greatest miners ever to exist in\nMiddle-earth. The Dwarves dug immense halls under mountains where they\nbuilt their cities. Dwarven miners dug for precious minerals such as\ngold, iron, copper, and silver from all over mountains in Middle-earth,\nthough the Dwarves considered coal mining degrading. In ancient times,\nthe Dwarves found Mithril in the mines of Khazad-dûm. While mining\nbeneath the Lonely Mountains, they discovered the Arkenstone at the\nHeart of the Mountain.\n\nThey were also capable masons and smiths - Dwarven smithing skills were\nsaid to be rivaled only by those of the Elves, and their masonry\ncreations were bested by none. The skill of the Dwarves was unmatched;\nthey crafted objects of great beauty out of diamond, emerald, ruby and\nsapphire. Everything Dwarven was beautifully crafted and intricate. They\ncrafted many famed weapons, armors, and items of art and beauty, among\nthem Narsil, the sword of Elendil, the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin and the\nnecklace Nauglamír.\n\nDwarven armies were vast and powerful, and possessed vast legions of\nsoldiers, cavalry and siege weapons, and their soldiers were equipped\nwith powerful weapons, armors and tools for battle. Many different\nweapons were utilized by their soldiers, such as swords, axes, throwing\naxes, throwing knives, and warhammers.\n\nThey had a knack for starting a fire almost anywhere out of almost\nanything. Although they knew how, Dwarves did not farm or herd often, as\nthey preferred to spend their time underground mining and crafting. They\nrather traded crafted items with men and elves in exchange for food.\n\nArchitecture\n\n\n\nThey built many famed halls including the Lonely Mountain, Belegost,\nNogrod, Khazad-dum, and Menegroth. The Dwarves also reforged the gates\nof Minas Tirith and rebuilt the walls of Helm's Deep after the War of\nthe Ring.\n\nTheir cities appeared to be constructed just under mountains or mountain\nranges. Dwarven miners would excavate into the mountains to create an\nentrance, and then dig through and under the mountain to create the\ngroundwork for their cities. Dwarven cities were absolutely massive and\nvery expansive, reaching the far depths of the earth. Dwarves continued\nto mine in their cities to expand them and discover more resources like\nprecious metals and minerals.\n\nDwarven cities ran throughout mountains and mountain ranges, stretched\nup, down and side-to-side in the massive caverns beneath the surface,\nbut it was largely unknown how cities were structured and sectioned off.\nIn Khazad-dum, there was a section of the city known as the Chamber of\nMazarbul, also known as the Chamber of Records. There were also sections\nof the city mentioned in the Book of Mazarbul such as the “First Hall,”\n“Second Hall,” “Third Deep,” “Twenty-first hall” and the “North end.”\n\nThe beauty of the Dwarves' cities was legend. One stronghold, Erebor\n(located in the Lonely Mountains), had its wealth coming from precious\ngems hewn from rock and in “great seams of gold running like rivers\nthrough stone.”\n\nA name for where the Dwarves' were located was Phurunargian, which meant\nDwarf-delving in the Common Tongue.\n\nNotable Dwarven Realms\n\n-   Khazad-dum, under the Misty Mountains\n-   Nogrod and Belegost, under the Blue Mountains\n-   Lonely Mountain/Erebor\n-   Grey Mountains\n-   Iron Hills\n-   Glittering Caves\n-   Orocarni (Red Mountains)\n\nLanguage and Writing System\n\nLanguage\n\nThe Dwarven language was created by Aulë when he created the Dwarves\nthemselves, and called it Khuzdul, which meant 'Dwarvish'. The language\nwas a harsh sounding tongue and sounded strange and harsh to other\nraces, and no other non-dwarf did they permit to learn their language\nfor it was guarded jealously. They rarely spoke their own language\naround other races, and preferred to use the languages of other races\nwhen around them.\n\nCertainly in the First Age when they first made contact with the Elves,\nthe only tongue in Beleriand would have been Sindarin at that time as\nthe Noldor had not yet returned from Aman. As a logical consequence,\ntherefore, Sindarin was a language used by the dwarves. In fact, the\nDwarves were so impressed by the Elvish runes (The Cirth of Daeron) for\nwriting Sindarin that they adopted them for use in their own tongue and\nused them forever more. \n\nWriting System\n\nThe Dwarves used Angerthas, a runic writing system based on Cirth. There\nwere different variations of Angerthas, which varied by each Dwarven\nclan; the Dwarves of Khazad-dum had their own variation and introduced a\nnumber of unsystematic changes in the system. The Dwarves of Erebor also\nused a further modification of the system, which was known as the mode\nof Erebor. The mode of Erebor was notably exemplified in the Book of\nMazarbul.\n\nSome examples of Angerthas were seen in notable Dwarven texts, including\nthe Book of Mazarbul, Thror's Map, as well as other objects such as the\nKey to the Side-door, the key which unlocked the side door of Erebor.\n\nWeapons and Armour\n\n_See Dwarven Weapons and Armour_\n\nDwarven soldiers usually used axes as their weapon of choice because it\ncan be used as a tool or a weapon, but in addition to axes they used\nhatchets, mattocks, short swords, war hammers, and very occasionaly\nthere is mention of Dwarven archers.\n\nAs for armor, Dwarves favored chain-mail and other metallic armor — the\nmost expensive and precious of which was ring mail made of mithril. (A\nvest of mithril was given to Bilbo by Thorin before The Battle of the\nFive Armies. It was worn during the battle and later protected his\nnephew Frodo throughout his quest.) Gandalf said that this small coat\nwas worth more than the whole of the Shire combined.\n\nMusic\n\nMany songs were sung in the deep and grand halls of the Dwarves. One\nvery notable song of the Dwarves was “Far over the Misty Mountains\nCold”, also known as the “Song of the Lonely Mountain,” and commonly\nreferred by fans as the “Dwarf Song.” Another song sung in Dwarven\nculture was the Song of Durin. This song told of the history of\nKhazad-dum/Moria and honored Durin, first leader of Durin's Folk.\n\nWicked Dwarves\n\nOf the races, Dwarves are the most resistant to corruption and influence\nof Morgoth and later Sauron. The seven rings of Power of the dwarves did\nnot turn them to evil, but it did amplify their greed and lust for gold.\nIt is said that very few willfully served the side of darkness. The\nHobbit refers to these as wicked dwarves. Of the seven houses few\nfought on either side during The Last Alliance at the end of the Second\nAge, and none from the House of Durin ever fought on the side of\nevil. However, in times of war, Dwarves often refused to ally\nthemselves with Elves or Men, choosing to remain neutral or oblivious to\nthe clashes between good and evil. During the early parts of the Third\nAge, it is known that in some places wicked dwarves had made alliances\nwith the goblins and orcs. It is suggested by Tolkien in some of his\nnotes that the dwarves that turned to wickedness most likely came from\nthe far eastern mansions (and perhaps some of the nearer ones), and came\nunder the Shadow of Morgoth and finally turned to evil. It is however\nunclear if these refer to Dwarves beyond Iron Hills (the most eastern\nknown stronghold of the Dwarves) Because Dwarves are not evil by\nnature, few ever served the Enemy of their own free will (though rumors\nof Men suggest the total was greater).\n\nIn some of Tolkien's earliest writings the Dwarven race as a whole was\nportrayed as an evil creation of Melkor, but Tolkien's ideas evolved as\nhe continued to write about the Dwarves.\n\n\nThe Seven Clans\n\nThe Dwarves' seven clans were:\n\n-   1. Longbeards, also known as Durin's Folk; originally from Mount\n    Gundabad they also founded the great Dwarf Mansion of Khazad-dûm\n    (a.k.a. Moria or Dwarrowdelf) in the Misty Mountains, the Iron\n    Hills, the holds in the Grey Mountains and, finally, the Lonely\n    Mountain.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   2-3. Firebeards & Broadbeams. Originally from the Blue Mountains,\n    they were paired but Tolkien never cleared which tribe built Nogrod\n    and which Belegost.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   4-5. Ironfists & Stiffbeards. Originated in the Far East; Orocarni.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   6-7. Blacklocks & Stonefoots. Originated in the Far East; Orocarni.\n-   The Seven Clans of the Dwarves descended from the Seven Dwarf\n    Fathers created by Aulë\n\n\nLocation\n\nThe Dwarves lived and mined in several places throughout Middle-earth\nmany times, which included:\n\n-   Moria or Khazad-dûm and other places in the Misty Mountains.\n-   Lonely Mountain or Erebor.\n-   Mount Gundabad.\n-   The Iron Hills.\n-   The Blue Mountains or Ered Luin, where the cities Nogrod and\n    Belegost existed during the First Age.\n-   The Grey Mountains or Ered Mithrin, although the dwarves were later\n    driven out by dragons.\n-   The Orocarni, the Red Mountains of the East.\n\nNames\n\nThe Dwarves called themselves the _Khazad_, the name Aulë gave them;\nthis translates as the _Hadhodrim_ in Sindarin, and the _Casari_ in\nQuenya. Casari was the common word for Dwarves among the Ñoldor, but the\nSindar usually called them the _Naugrim_ or _Nogothrim_, the Stunted\nPeople.\n\nDwarves would, as a rule, not tell people of other races their real\nnames, but take names in Westron instead, and keep their real names\nsecret, not even on their tombs would they inscribe it.\n\nMany Dwarven names in the works of Tolkien are taken from the poetic\nViking prophecies, Völuspá (Old Norse: _Vǫluspá_). A significant part of\nthe prophecy describes the pagan world view of the Vikings, and in that\npart can be found the Count of Dwarves, which is mostly a list of names.\nAll the dwarf names from the Hobbit are taken from that source as well\nas the name of Gandalf. Some other names, such as Gimli (meaning shelter\nfrom fire), and Harlan are taken from the Icelandic language, but not\nfrom Völuspá. Only a few Dwarves in the works of Tolkien have original\nnames in Khuzdul. These include Azaghâl, and Telchar.\n\nIn the earlier forms of Tolkien's Mythology, the Dwarves were also\ncalled the 'Nauglath'.\n\n\nEarlier Forms of the Legendarium\n\nIn the earliest forms of Tolkien's Middle-earth mythology, the Dwarves\nwere mistaken to be evil beings created by Melkor."

    "text": "SINDARIN was the Elvish language most commonly spoken in Middle-earth\nduring in the Third Age - in the real world it is universally referred\nto as, when not in canonical context, “ELVEN” or “ELVISH”.\n\nThe written alphabet of Sindarin, as with Quenya, is typically Tengwar\n(the Feanorian Characters), although Cirth (Runes) can also be used.\n\n\nHistory\n\n It was the language of the Sindar,\nthose Teleri who chose to stay behind on the Great Journey of the Elves.\nIt was derived from an earlier language called “Common Telerin”. When\nthe Ñoldor came back to Middle-earth, they adopted the Sindarin\nlanguage, for the Sindar were more numerous and slower to learn the\nlanguage of Valinor, Quenya the Noldor's native language. Later events\nled to the banning of the use of Quenya within and around Beleriand\nleading to it's eventual use as a high language of law. Before the\ndownfall, most of the Men of Númenor also spoke the language. Knowledge\nof it was kept in the Númenorean realm in exile Gondor, especially among\nthe learned. Dwarves, notably Durin's Folk, used Sindarin when\ncommunicating with Elves. Sindarin is the language referred to as _the\nElven-tongue_ in _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\nTolkien originally imagined that the language which would become\n_Sindarin_ was spoken by the Ñoldor (second clan of Elves). However he\nlater decided that it was the language of the Sindar. For this reason it\nis called _Noldorin_ in the older material, such as the Etymologies.\nWhen Noldorin became Sindarin, it also adopted some features of the\noriginally unrelated language _Ilkorin_. Tolkien based the sound and\nsome of the grammar of his Noldorin/Sindarin on Welsh, and Sindarin\ndisplays of the consonant mutations that characterise the Celtic\n(especially Brythonic) languages. The language was also probably\ninfluenced to an extent by the Germanic languages, as Tolkien was a\nscholar of both Old English and Old Norse.\n\n\nGrammar\n\nSindarin is mainly analytic, though traits of its highly inflected\nprogenitor can still be seen.\n\nPhonology\n\nSindarin was designed to have a Welsh-like phonology. It has most of the\nsame sounds and similar phonotactics.\n\n  -------- ----- -------------------------------------------------------------\n  LETTER   IPA   NOTES\n  a              \n  b              \n  c              \n  ch             The “ch” in the German word “Buch”, not as in “church”\n  d              \n  dh             The “th” in “heather”\n  e              \n  f              Represents  when final or before n,  everywhere else.\n  g              \n  h              \n  hw             \n  i              Represents  when initial,  everywhere else.\n  l              \n  lh       ɬ     The same as the Welsh LL.\n  m              \n  n              \n  ng             Represents  when final,  everywhere else.\n  o              \n  p              \n  ph             Represents  when final,  everywhere else.\n  r              \n  rh             \n  s              \n  t              \n  th             The “th” in “heath”\n  u              \n  v              \n  w              \n  y              Pronounced like German _ü_\n  -------- ----- -------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn accent signifies a long vowel (á, é, etc.). In a monosyllabic word, a\ncircumflex is used (â, ê, etc.). However, for practical reasons, users\nof the ISO Latin-1 character set often substitute ý for ŷ.\n\nDiphthongs are _ai_ (pronounced like AIsle), _ei_ (dAY), _ui_ (tOO\nYoung), _au_ (cOW), and _oi_ (bOY). If the last diphthong finishes a\nword, it is spelt _aw_. There are also diphthongs _ae_ and _oe_ with no\nEnglish counterparts; Tolkien recommended to substitute _ai_ and _oi_\nrespectively if one does not care about details. If one does care, it is\nsimilar to pronouncing _a_ or _o_ respectively in the same syllable as\none pronounces an _e_ (as in pEt).\n\nIn archaic Sindarin, there was a vowel similar to German _ö_ (IPA: ),\nwhich Tolkien mostly transcribed as _œ_ (usually _not_ as _oe_ as is\noften found in publications like the Silmarillion, cf. _Nirnaeth\nArnoediad_ , _Goelydh_ ).\nThis vowel later came to be pronounced and is therefore transcribed as\nsuch .\n\nArchaic Sindarin also had a spirant _m_ or nasal _v_ (IPA: ), which was\ntranscribed as _mh_ (though always pronounced in later Sindarin).\n\nNouns\n\nPluralization\n\nSindarin plurals are characterised by _i-affection_, or _umlaut_. The\nSindarin term for this is _prestanneth_ (disturbance, affection). Almost\nall Sindarin words form their plurals like English man/men and\ngoose/geese — by changing the vowels in the word. The plural patterns\nare:\n\n-   In non-final syllables:\n    -   a > e — galadh > gelaidh\n    -   e > e — bereth > berith\n    -   i > i — dineth > dinith\n    -   o > e — gowest > gewist\n    -   u > y — tulus > tylys\n    -   y > y — (no example available)\n-   In final syllables:\n    -   a > ai — anar > enair\n    -   â > ai — tâl > tail\n    -   e > i — adaneth > edenith\n    -   ê > î — hên > hîn\n    -   i > i — brennil > brennil\n    -   î > î — dîs > dîs\n    -   o > y — brannon > brennyn\n    -   ó > ý — bór > býr\n    -   ô > ý — thôn > thýn\n    -   u > y — urug > yryg\n    -   û > ui — hû > hui\n    -   y > y — ylf > ylf\n    -   ý > ý — mýl > mýl\n    -   au > oe — naug > noeg\n\nNote that _ai_ can sometimes become _î_ (or, less commonly, _ý_).\n\nThe reason for this is that the primitive plural ending _-î_ (still\npresent in Quenya as _-i_) affected the vowels in the word by making\nthem higher and fronter. After this sound change occurred, the suffix\n_-î_ disappeared when all final vowels were lost.\n\nClass Plural\n\nSindarin also has several suffixes which denote a so-called class\nplural. For example, _-ath_ indicates a group of something, e. g.\n_elenath_ from elen (an archaic form of _êl_), meaning _star_ and\n_-ath_. It means _a group of stars_ or _all the stars in the sky_.\nAnother ending, _-rim_, is used to indicate a race, e. g. _nogothrim_\nfrom _nogoth_ — _dwarf_ and _-rim_, meaning _the race of dwarves_. The\nending _-hoth_ is generally used in an unfriendly sense, e. g.\n_gaurhoth_ from _gaur_ — _werewolf_ and _-hoth_, meaning\n_werewolf-host_.\n\nMutation\n\nSindarin has a complex series of mutations. There are three main\ndifferent types of mutations: _soft mutation_ (or lenition), _nasal\nmutation_ and _stop_ (occlusive) _mutation_. Additionally, a _mixed\nmutation_ is also observed after certain particles or prepositions.\nFinally, it is presumed that Sindarin also once had what we could call\nan _archaic spirantal mutation_ (also sometimes called _liquid mutation_\nby scholars). It is still uncertain whether this mutation is still\nproductive or if it only occurs in ancient constructs.\n\nInitial mutations must not be confused with assimilations that may occur\nin compound words (such as, for instance, in the names _Araphor_,\n_Arassuil_ and _Caradhras_).\n\nThe following table outlines how different consonants are affected by\nthe different mutations.\n\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n  BASIC   SOFT   NASAL   MIXED   STOP   LIQUID\n  b       v      m       b       b      v\n  c       g      ch      g       ch     ch\n  d       dh     n       d       d      dh\n  g       '      ng      g       g      '\n  h       ch     ch      h       ch     ch\n  lh      thl    'l      'l      thl    'l\n  m       v      m       m       m      v\n  p       b      ph      b       b      ph\n  rh      thr    'r      'r      thr    'r\n  s       s      s       h       s      s\n  t       d      th      d       th     th\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n\nHere the apostrophe indicates elision.\n\nWords beginning in _b-_, _d-_, or _g-_ which descend from older _mb-_,\n_nd-_, or _ng-_ are affected differently by the mutations:\n\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n  BASIC   SOFT   NASAL   MIXED   STOP   LIQUID\n  b       m      mb      mb      mb     b\n  d       n      nd      nd      nd     d\n  g       ng     g       g       g      g\n  ------- ------ ------- ------- ------ --------\n\nTake, for example, the deictic article _i_, which triggers soft\nmutation. When added to a word like _tâl_, it becomes _i dâl_. In\nSindarin's phonological history, _t_ became _d_ in the middle of a word.\nBecause _i tâl_ at the time was considered one word, the _t_ became _d_,\nand thus _i dâl_. However, without the article the word is still _tâl_.\n\nMutation is triggered in various ways:\n\n-   Soft mutation, the most widely occurring mutation, is triggered by\n    the singular article _i_, the prefixes _athra-, ath-, go-, gwa-,\n    ú-,_ and _u-_, as well as the prepositions _ab, am, adel, be, dad,\n    di, na, nu,_ and _î_, and after _avo_. It also affects the second\n    element in a compound, an adjective following a noun, and the object\n    of a verb.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Nasal mutation is triggered by the plural article _in_, and the\n    prepositions _an, dan,_ and plural _'nin_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Mixed mutation is triggered by the genitive article _en_, and the\n    prepositions _ben, erin, nan, 'nin,_ and _uin_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Stop mutation is triggered by the prepositions _ed, ned,_ and\n    _o(d)_.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Liquid mutation is presumably triggered by the preposition _or_.\n\nPronouns\n\nPronouns are perhaps the most poorly attested feature of Sindarin. What\nhas been reconstructed by the comparative method is largely conjectural\nand is not agreed upon, and therefore will not be addressed in this\narticle.\n\nSindarin pronouns, like those in English, still maintain some case\ndistinction. Sindarin pronouns have nominative, accusative, genitive,\nand dative forms.\n\n \n\nFirst Person\n\nSecond Person\n\nThird Person\n\n \n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\nNominative\n\nim\n\nme\n\nle, ci\n\nle, ci\n\ne, te\n\nti\n\nAccusative\n\nnin\n\nmen\n\nlen, cin\n\nlen, cin\n\nten, den\n\ntin, hain\n\nGenitive\n\n \n\nmín\n\n \n\nlín\n\ndîn\n\n \n\nDative\n\nanim, enni\n\nammen\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEnclitic\n\n-n\n\n-m\n\n-ch\n\n \n\n—\n\n-r\n\nVerbs\n\nSindarin verbs are also quite complex. The number of attested verbs in\nSindarin is small, so the Sindarin verb system is imperfectly known; no\nverb has a full paradigm of forms available. There are two main types of\nverbs: _basic_ and _derived_. Basic verbs have stems which end in a\nconsonant, and derived verbs have stems which incorporate some sort\nderivational morpheme (such as a causative ending) which ends in _-a_.\n\nBasic Verbs\n\nBasic verbs, though smaller in number than derived verbs, have a very\ncomplex conjugation which arises from Sindarin's phonological history.\n\nBasic verbs form the infinitve by adding _-i_: _giri_ from _gir-_. This\nending causes an _a_ or _o_ in the stem to umlaut to _e_: _blebi_ from\n_blab-_. Sindarin does not use infinitive forms very often, and rather\nuses the gerund to achieve the same meaning.\n\nFor all persons except the third person singular, the present tense is\nformed by the insertion of _-i_, and the proper enclitic pronomial\nending: _girin_, _girim_, _girir_. As with the infinitive, _-i_ causes\nan _a_ or _o_ in the stem to umlaut to _e_: _pedin_, _pedim_, _pedir_,\nfrom _pad-_. The third person singular, because it has a zero-ending,\ndoes not require the insertion of _-i_. This leaves the bare stem,\nwhich, because of Sindarin's phonological history, causes the vowel of\nthe stem to become long: _gîr_, _blâb_, _pâd_.\n\nThe past tense of basic verbs is very complicated and poorly attested.\nOne common reconstructed system is to use _-n_: _darn_. However, the\nonly time this _-n_ actually remains is after a stem in _-r_. After a\nstem ending in _-l_, _-n_ becomes _-ll_: _toll_. After _-b, -d, -g, -v,_\nor _-dh_, it is metathesized and then assimilated to the same place of\narticulation as the consonant it now follows. The consonant then\nexperiences what could be called a “backwards mutation”: _-b, -d,_ and\n_-g_ become _-p, -b,_ and _-c_, and _-v_ and _-dh_ become _-m_ and _-d_.\nThe matter is complicated even further when pronomial endings are added.\nBecause _-mp, -mb, -nt, -nd,_ and _-nc_ did not survive medially, they\nbecome _-mm-, -mm-, -nn-, -nn-,_ and _-ng_. In addition, past tense\nstems in _-m_ would have _-mm-_ before any pronomial endings. Because\nthis all may seem rather overwhelming, look at these examples which show\nstep-by-step transformations:\n\n-   _cab-_ > **_cabn_ > **_canb_ > **_camb_ > _camp_, becoming _camm-_\n    with any pronomial endings.\n-   _ped-_ > **_pedn_ > **_pend_ > _pent_, becoming _penn-_ with any\n    pronomial endings.\n-   _dag-_ > **_dagn_ > **_dang_ (_n_ pronounced as in _men_) > **_dang_\n    (_n_ pronounced as in _sing_) > _danc_, becoming _dang-_ with any\n    pronomial endings.\n-   _lav-_ > **_lavn_ > **_lanv_ > **_lanm_ > **_lamm_ > _lam_, becoming\n    _lamm-_ before any pronomial endings.\n-   _redh-_ > **_redhn_ > **_rendh_ > **_rend_ > _rend_, becoming\n    _renn-_ before any pronomial endings.\n\nThe future tense is formed by the addition of _-tha_. An _-i_ is also\ninserted between the stem and _-tha_, which again causes _a_ and _o_ to\numlaut to _e_. Endings for all persons except for the first person\nsingular can be added without any further modification: _giritham_,\n_blebithar_. The first person singular ending _-n_ causes the _-a_ in\n_-tha_ to become _-o_: _girithon_, _blebithon_, _pedithon_.\n\nThe imperative is formed with the addition of _-o_ to the stem: _giro!_,\n_pado!_, _blabo!_.\n\nDerived Verbs\n\nDerived verbs have a much less complex conjugation because they have a\nthematic vowel (usually _a_) which reduces the number of consonant\ncombinations which occur.\n\nThe infinitive is formed with -o, which replaces the -a of the stem, e.\ng. _lacho_ from _lacha-_.\n\nThe present tense is formed without modification to the stem. Pronomial\nendings are added without any change.\n\nThe past tense is formed with the ending _-nt_, which becomes _-nne_\nwith any pronomial endings, e. g. _erthant_, _erthanner_.\n\nThe future tense is formed with _-tha_. With the addition of the first\nperson singular _-n_, this becomes _-tho_.\n\nThe imperative is formed like the infinitive.\n\n\nDialects\n\nDuring the First Age there were several dialects of Sindarin:\n\n-   _Doriathrin_ or the language of Doriath, a form of the language\n    which preserved many archaic forms;\n-   _Falathrin_ or the language of the Falas, later also spoken in\n    Nargothrond;\n-   _North Sindarin_, the dialects originally spoken in Dorthonion and\n    Hithlum by the Sindar, these dialects contained many unique words\n    and were not fully intelligible with the Sindarin of Beleriand\n    proper.\n\nWith the exception of Doriathrin, the dialects were changed under\nÑoldorin influence, and adopted many Quenya features, as well as unique\nsound changes devised by the Ñoldor (who loved changing languages). The\ndistinct dialects disappeared after the Ñoldor and Sindar were dispersed\nduring the later Battles of Beleriand. In the refuges on the Isle of\nBalar and the Mouths of Sirion a new dialect arose under the refugees,\nwhich mainly took after Falathrin. During the Second Age and Third Age\nSindarin was a lingua franca for all Elves and their friends, until it\nwas displaced as the Common tongue by Westron, a descendant of Adûnaic\nwhich was heavily influenced by Sindarin.\n\n_Sindarin_ is actually a Quenya term. The Sindarin word was perhaps\nEDHELLEN (“Elvish”).\n\n\nSample Phrases\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings_\n\n-   _Ai na vedui Dúnadan! Mae govannen!_ - Ah, at last, Westman! Well\n    met!\n-   _Noro lim._ - Run fast.\n-   _Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!

    "text": "GONDOR was the prominent kingdom of Men in Middle-earth, bordered by\nRohan to the north, Harad to the south, the cape of Andrast and the Sea\nto the west, and Mordor to the east. Its first capital was Osgiliath,\nmoved to Minas Tirith in TA 1640. The city of Minas Tirith remained the\ncapital of Gondor for the rest of the Third Age and into years of the\nFourth Age; other major fortresses include Dol Amroth in Belfalas and\nOsgiliath, which was a city on the Anduin.\n\nGondor was founded by the brothers Isildur and Anárion, exiles from\nNúmenor. Gondor was an allied kingdom with Arnor, whose line of king\nchieftains came from Isildur, while the Line of the Kings of Gondor was\nfrom Anárion. Gondor was at the height of its power in its early years\ndue to the ships and the military might that its armies possessed.\nHowever, continued attacks by allies of Sauron, civil war, and a\ndevastating plague caused it to gradually decline over the course of the\nThird Age until Sauron's final defeat and the crowning of Aragorn II\nElessar. Following that time the power of Gondor once again expanded,\nuntil the former lands of Arnor were brought under the banner of the\nReunited Kingdom. \n\nIn all, there were thirty-one kings of Gondor after Anárion, who was\nslain before Barad-dûr at the Siege of Barad-dûr. \n\n\nHistory\n\nLike Arnor to the north, Gondor was a Mannish kingdom founded by\nAnárion, the youngest son of Elendil, after the Downfall of Númenor. It\nwas located to the South of Rohan and to the West of Mordor, on the Bay\nof Belfalas.\n\nEarly years\n\n Before the Downfall of Númenor,\nGondor was home to many Númenórean colonists, who either mixed blood\nwith the indigenous Middle Men if they were friendly, or dispersed them\ninto Ras Morthil, Dunland, and Drúadan Forest. Gondor, at a latitude\ncomparable to Venice, was a more fertile region than Arnor to the north,\nand therefore it already had a larger population before the ships of\nElendil's sons arrived, including a well-established city, Pelargir.\n\nThe Faithful or Elendili from Númenor were given a warm reception upon\ntheir arrival by those that had already colonized Middle-earth,\nincluding a colonial branch of Númenorean royalty at Dor-en-Ernil. The\ncolonists north of Anduin accepted Elendil's claim to kingship over\nthem. South of the Great River, however, the newly exiled Númenoreans\ndid not recognize Elendil's claim.\n\nGondor was being founded after Númenor's population had already split\nbetween The Faithful and King's Men, and all of the more southern\ncolonies (such as Umbar) remained enemies of The Faithful.\n\nThe newly founded kingdom of Gondor was then part of the Last Alliance\nof Elves and Men which overthrew Sauron for the first time at the very\nend of the Second Age, and when Isildur cut the finger of Sauron.\n\nGondor Prospers\n\nAfter the war, Gondor's power and wealth grew steadily (only interrupted\nby an Easterling invasion in TA 492). Its power would continue to grow\ninto the 9th century Third Age. While the power of Gondor's sister\nkingdom Arnor peaked during the 9th century, when it broke into various\nsuccessor states, Gondor's greatest glory was yet to come. Gondor's\ngreat cities Minas Anor, Minas Ithil, Osgiliath and Pelargir only grew\nand the Dunedain of Gondor started to rule over more and more of the\nlesser people.\n\nGondor's Golden Age\n\n\n\nGondor's power reached its Golden Age under the four “Ship-kings”:\n\n-   Tarannon Falastur r. TA 830 – TA 913. First of the Ship-Kings, died\n    childless\n-   Eärnil I r. TA 913 – TA 936. Nephew of Tarannon\n-   Ciryandil r. TA 936 – TA 1015\n-   Hyarmendacil I (Ciryaher) r. TA 1015 - TA 1149. Last of the\n    Ship-Kings. In the reign of the powerful king, Hyarmendacil I (c.\n    12th century TA) Gondor reached the height of its power. During\n    Hyarmendacil's reign, Gondor's borders reached their furthest\n    extent. The Kingdom extended east to the Sea of Rhûn, south to the\n    nearest lands of the Haradrim, as far north as Mirkwood, and west\n    towards the borders of Arnor.\n\nSuch was Gondor's wealth during the period that men from other lands\nwould say in envy: “In Gondor precious stones are but pebbles for the\nchildren to play with.” Gondor would also enjoy several centuries of\npeace due to its military might.\n\n\n\nThe Decline of Gondor\n\nHowever, after decadence spread under the Kings of Gondor and a long\nperiod of decline began (although Gondor experienced several revivals).\nThree great calamities struck Gondor during the second millennium of the\nThird Age, which are held to be the chief reasons for its decline: the\nKin-strife, the Great Plague, and the invasion of the Wainriders (a\ntribe of Easterlings).\n\nThe Kin-strife\n\nIn the 15th century TA a great civil war named the Kin-strife tore the\nnation apart. The current King Eldacar was of mixed blood: his mother\nwas of the Northmen. Popular displeasure at this led to the overthrow of\nKing Eldacar by Castamir, the admiral of all of Gondor's naval forces\nwho possessed some royal blood. Eldacar's son was slain, and he fled\nnorth. Castamir was afterwards known as Castamir the Usurper. During his\nten-year rule, he proved to be very cruel, and because of his love of\nhis old fleet, he lavished attention on the coastal regions while the\ninterior provinces were ignored and left to rot. Eldacar then returned\nwith an army of his Northman kinsmen, and the armies of the Men of\nGondor joined them from interior provinces such as Anórien. Osgiliath\nwas devastated during this conflict, its great bridge destroyed and its\n_Palantír_ lost. Eldacar slew Castamir and reclaimed his throne, but\nCastamir's sons and their forces were besieged in Pelargir, the great\nport of Gondor. They eventually retreated to Umbar, where they joined\nwith the Corsairs, and troubled Gondor for many years, until their\ndescendants died out.\n\nThe Great Plague\n\nLater, the Great Plague struck and the White Tree died. This Plague was\nno localized event: the Plague swept through all of Middle-earth,\nreaching the successor states of Arnor and the Hobbits of the Shire in\nthe North. King Tarondor found a sapling of the White Tree, and moved\nthe capital from Osgiliath to Minas Anor, the City of Anárion. During\nthis time, Gondor was so depopulated that the fortifications guarding\nagainst the re-entry of evil into Mordor were abandoned. It is believed\nthat had the Haradrim or Easterlings been capable of attacking Gondor at\nthis time, it would have fallen. However, the Plague left Gondor's\nenemies in no better condition than Gondor itself, and neither side was\ncapable of mounting new offensives.\n\nThe Invasion of the Wainriders\n\nFollowing the sapping of Gondor's strength by the plague, it did recover\nbut then the Wainrider (Easterlings) invaded and devastated Gondor, and\nthe conflict lasted for almost a century. The Wainriders destroyed the\nNorthern Army of Gondor, but survivors linked up with the victorious\nSouthern Army of Gondor which destroyed the Haradrim as they crossed the\nriver Poros, led by a general named Eärnil, and they destroyed the\nWainriders as they celebrated their victory during the Battle of the\nCamp.\n\nThe Line of the Kings Fails\n\nReunification Rejected\n\nIn TA 1944 Gondor faced a succession crisis when King Ondoher was slain\nin battle with both his sons. Arvedui, Prince of Arthedain, Ondoher's\nson-in-law, and the victorious general Eärnil, who was a distant\nblood-relative of Ondoher, claimed the throne. Arvedui's claim lay\nmainly in the reintroduction of the old Nùmenorean law of accession,\nwhich stated the eldest (remaining) child should succeed the king. If\nthe law was reintroduced, then Arvedui's wife Fíriel, Ondoher's daughter\nand last remaining child, would become Ruling-Queen, making their\ndescendants Kings of both Arnor and Gondor. Arvedui also tried to put\nweight behind his claim, as he was Isildur's heir. The council of Gondor\nrecognised that the name of Isildur was held in honour in Gondor, but\nthey dictated that the South-Kingdom must be ruled by an Heir of\nAnarion. Due to his ancestry from Fíriel and Arvedui, more than a\nmillennium later, Aragorn Elessar put forward his claim as the heir of\nboth Isildur and Anarion.\n\nEärnil laid his claim as being a direct descendant of King Telumehtar\nUmbardacil. His claim was also greatly bolstered by the popularity he\nhad gained as the victorious general who saved Gondor from the\nWainriders after winning the southern theatre of the war. Steward\nPelendur who was temporarily ruling Gondor as serving as arbiter of\nsuccession, intervened in favour of Gondor's victorious general who\nwould rule as Eärnil II.\n\nThe Last Heir of Anárion\n\nDuring the Battle of Fornost, Eärnil II's heir Eärnur led Gondor's\nforces to victory over the Witch-king of Angmar, who was actually the\nLord of the Nazgûl. Although Eärnur wished to fight him, Eärnur's horse\nwas terrified and fled the battle against his wishes. By the time, he\nmastered his horse and returned the Witch-king had fled. Glorfindel the\nElf then prophesied to him that it was better that he not fight the Lord\nof the Nazgûl because “never by the hand of man shall he fall”.\n\nEärnur later ascended to the throne, ruling from Minas Anor (“Tower of\nthe Sun”). During this time, the Ringwraiths captured the city of Minas\nIthil (“Tower of the Moon”), renaming it _Minas Morgul_ (“Tower of Dark\nSorcery”) and taking it as their lair. Minas Anor was renamed _Minas\nTirith_ (Tower of Guard) as a result. The Lord of the Nazgûl repeatedly\nsent messengers to Minas Tirith challenging Eärnur to single combat,\ntaunting him that he had fled out of cowardice from facing him during\nthe Battle of Fornost. Eventually, King Eärnur was overcome by wrath and\nrode with a small company of knights to Minas Morgul, to accept the\nchallenge. They were never heard from again; and so ended the Line of\nAnárion.\n\nThe Stewards of Gondor\n\nThe Ruling Stewards\n\nA long line of hereditary Stewards governed the realm after the\ndisappearance of Eärnur, son of Eärnil, since there was no proof that\nthe last king was dead, and no claimant had enough support to be\naccepted as his successor. The line of Anárion was held to have failed,\nand Gondor was not willing to risk to another Kin-strife, which would\nsurely have destroyed it. Whenever there was a new Steward, he would\nswear an oath to yield rule of Gondor back to the King, in essence only\nan heir of Isildur, if he should ever return. In Gondor, there was no\none who could claim descent from Isildur in direct line, and the\nnorthern line of Arnor had effectively disappeared, so this oath was not\nconsidered seriously. The line of Stewards ruled as Kings, without\nhaving the title. During the War of the Ring, the ruling Steward of\nGondor was Denethor II, and his two sons were Boromir and younger\nFaramir- the latter being the last Ruling Steward of Gondor.\n\nCirion and Eorl\n\nIn TA 2510 when Steward Cirion ruled over Gondor, the nation faced one\nof its greatest perils: an Easterling tribe named the _Balchoth_ invaded\nGondor with mass force. Gondor's army marched to fight the Balchoth but\nwere cut off from Minas Tirith and pushed back in the direction of the\nLimlight.\n\nMessengers were sent to get help from the Éothéod, a tribe, which lived\nin the northern vales of the Anduin, but nobody expected the messengers\nto reach their destination. When certain peril came upon Gondor,\nhowever, the Éothéod turned the tide of the Battle of the Field of\nCelebrant. After the victory the Éothéod were awarded the fields of\nCalenardhon north of the White Mountains from the Gap of Rohan at the\nsouthern end of the Hithaeglir, Fangorn forest, rivers Limlight to\nAnduin, western Emyn Muil, and the Mering Stream, where they established\nthe kingdom of Rohan with Eorl the Young as their first king. A\npermanent alliance between Gondor and Rohan was established by the oath\nEorl swore to Cirion.\n\nThe War of the Ring and the Restoration\n\nSeveral centuries later, Sauron had prepared for the final conquest, and\nin TA 3018 his forces overran Ithilien. The attack was stopped at\nOsgiliath with the destruction of the bridge across the Anduin. The\nfollowing year Minas Tirith faced a larger attack from Mordor, with\nadditional threat from the Corsairs of Umbar. Aragorn summoned the Dead\nMen of Dunharrow to destroy the forces from Umbar, freeing forces in the\nsouth of Gondor to come to the aid of Minas Tirith. Gondor then defeated\nthe army of Mordor with the aid of the Rohirrim in the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields, though with heavy losses. The combined army of the West\nthen carried the battle to Sauron at the Battle of the Morannon, a feint\nto distract Sauron's attention from Frodo Baggins's quest to destroy the\nOne Ring in Mount Doom, thus causing Sauron's destruction and the\nallies' ultimate victory.\n\nAfter the second and final defeat of Sauron, the Kingship was restored,\nwith Aragorn crowned as King Elessar of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor\nand Gondor. Faramir, last heir of the Ruling Stewards, retained his\noffice as the Steward to the King, and ruled over Gondor's eastern\nregion of Ithilien; a fair land between the river Anduin and the Ephel\nDúath. The oaths between Gondor and Rohan were renewed, and several\njoint campaigns were fought in the east and south against the remnant of\nthe Easterlings and Haradrim; all former territories of the\nSouth-kingdom were won back during the following centuries, and its\npower and wealth were restored. Several Tolkien's writings state that\n_“...of Eldarion son of Elessar it was foretold that he should rule a\ngreat realm, and that it should endure for a hundred generations of men\nafter him, that is until a new age brought in again new things; and from\nhim should come the kings of many realms in long days after”_.\n\n\nArmies\n\nSecond Age\n\nThe soldiers of Gondor were renowned during the Second Age for their\nskill and valour. Training men of Gondor during the Second Age instilled\nwithin their soldiers a martial spirit and ardor, goading them to fight\nto the death against the hordes of Mordor, Rhûn, and Harad. Every man\nwas physically imposing: being very tall at over six feet, very broad,\nand very strong as well. Every single soldier was in peak fighting\ncondition and ready to fight against Sauron's hordes (especially during\nthe War of the Last Alliance). The three major weapons they used were\nspears, longswords, and longbows. They also knew how to form cohesive\nbox-formations, which were sturdy enough for both offensive and\ndefensive purposes. The soldiers wore heavy plate armour and utilised\nlarge shields made out of multi-layered wood and edged in metal for\nreinforcement.\n\nThird Age\n\nGondor's armies prevented Mordor and its allies from overwhelming the\nrest of Middle-earth. Gondor was in a very crucial position, in order to\nguard Middle Earth and because of Gondor's proximity to Mordor, its\nmilitary forces had to be proficiently trained and vigilantly on guard\nat all times. Because of this, they were arguably the strongest country\nthat opposed Sauron. During the Third Age, most of Minas Tirith's armies\nwere trained and drilled to fight in tight infantry formations,\nsupported by archers and cavalry. Their armaments consisted of a\nchainmail undercoat with either a black tabard or plate armor over it.\nTheir standard weapons were long spears, longswords, and longbows,\ncomplimented by tower shields. \n\nMinas Tirith's immediate defenses comprised thousands of infantrymen\nstationed throughout Osgiliath, Cair Andros, and the Rammas Echor. These\nunits were most likely temporary detachments from the city. Minas Tirith\nalso had at least three companies of the elite Guards of the Citadel,\ntasked to defend the upper levels of the city. They wore black robes,\nsurcoats and winged silver crowns. The Guards of the City were not\nallowed to go in the main part of the City in their uniform.\nAdditionally, the sixth level of the city housed stables for a small\nforce of horsemen. Beyond Anduin and the defenses of Minas Tirith\noperated a secretive group of soldiers called the Rangers of Ithilien\nThe Rangers of Ithilien had guerrilla warfare aginst the Southrons,\nallies of Mordor. Similar to the Rangers of the North, the Rangers of\nIthilien were comprised of the remnant of the Dúnedain in their\nrespective Kingdom, in this case being the Dúnedain that once dwelled in\nIthilien.(the Rangers of the North were Arnorian Dúnedain, while the\nRangers of Ithilien are Gondorian- and were more populous than their\nnorthern kin).  Armed with longbows, swords, and spears, these men\nwatched and harassed the enemy throughout Ithilien, much akin to\nguerrilla warfare. The captain of the Rangers of Ithilien during the War\nof the Ring was Faramir, the younger brother of Boromir and the son of\nthe Steward of Gondor, Denethor II.\n\nThe defense of Gondor's fiefdoms were the responsibility of the\nrespective lords of these territories. Their training, strength in\nnumbers, and armaments varied from each fief (Lossarnach brought axemen\nto the aid of Minas Tirith while the men of Morthond Vale consisted of\narchers). The greatest of these fiefs was Dol Amroth, which brought\nforth the largest force to Minas Tirith, made up of men-at-arms and\narguably the best cavalry in Middle Earth- the elite Swan Knights.\n\nGondor's fleet at the time of the War of the Ring was docked at\nPelargir. This port and the Anduin River was essential in the defense of\nMinas Tirith. As made evident by the fiefdom's dire need to defend their\ncoasts and many rivers of Gondor, a majority of the fleet was\nconcentrated at Pelargir. This fleet was destroyed when the Black Ships\nof Umbar attacked, enslaving many of Gondor's sailors into the service\nof Mordor.\n\n\nSong of Gondor\n\n_Gondor! Gondor, between the Mountains and the Sea!_\n\n_West Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver Tree_\n\n_Fell like bright rain in gardens of the Kings of old._\n\n_O proud walls! White towers! O wingéd crown and throne of gold!_\n\n''O Gondor, Gondor! Shall Men behold the Silver Tree, ''\n\n_Or West Wind blow again between the Mountains and the Sea?_\n\nThis was sung by Aragorn on his trip with Legolas and Gimli to find\nPippin and Merry.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Gondor_ name means 'Land of Stone', from Sindarin GOND (stone) + (N)DOR\n(land), most likely given to it because of the White Mountains (Ered\nNimrais) and other mountain chains in the land (hypothetical Quenya name\nONDONÓRË).\n\n\nRegions of Gondor\n\n  Gondor was divided between several nearly\nautonomous regions. These were the following:\n\n-   Ithilien, a region along the east bank of the Anduin river under the\n    shadow of the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow). Ithilien was\n    abandoned and mostly under the control of Mordor during The War of\n    the Ring. (Although Gondor did have secret bases throughout the\n    region such as Henneth Annûn, and the Rangers of Ithilien used\n    guerilla warfare tactics to harass the enemy throughout Ithilien,\n    and disrupt supply lines and companies marching to and from Mordor.\n    After the War of the Ring, Faramir was made Lord Paramount of\n    Ithilien by Aragorn.\n-   South Ithilien, a portion of the the Ithilien south of Osgiliath.\n    The road (the Harad Road) the Southrons took to get to Morder lied\n    here.\n-   Anórien, a strip of land along the northern edge of the White\n    Mountains. Bordered by the Mering Stream and Rohan to the west,\n    Anduin to the east, the Mouths of Entwash to to the north, and\n    theWhite Mountainsand Rammas Echor to the south.\n-   Lossarnach, a heavily-populated farmland region southwest of Minas\n    Tirith.\n-   Lebennin, a plain extending from the White Mountains down to the Bay\n    of Belfalas that bordered Lossarnach.\n-   Belfalas, a fiefdom ruled by the Princes of Dol Amroth.\n-   Dor-en-Ernil, a narrow strip of land along the Bay of Belfalas ruled\n    by the Princes of Dol Amroth.\n-   Lamedon, a plain between the White Mountains and the River Ringló.\n-   Anfalas or _Langstrand_, a narrow strip of land along the sea\n    bordered by the Pinnath Gelin.\n-   Andrast, The western-most province of Gondor located on a narrow\n    peninsula jutting out into the Sea.\n-   Ringló Vale, a mini-province.\n-   Morthond or Blackroot Vale, where Duilin comes from.\n\nThe long cape of Andrast was not populated (by the descendants of\nNúmenóreans, but evidence from the _Unfinished Tales_ suggests that a\nsmall group of Púkel-men inhabited it.)\n\nAdditionally, Gondor held or had held the following regions at certain\npoints in its history:\n\n-   South Gondor or Harondor, an arid region between the rivers Porosand\n    Harnen, which was contested between Gondor and Harad.\n-   Calenardhon, which was given to the Éothéod and became Rohan. It's\n    boundaries were the rivers of Anduin in the east, Isenin the west,\n    Limlightin the north, and the White Mountains/ Mering Stream in the\n    south.\n-   Enedwaith, a region between the rivers Isen and Greyflood. It was\n    never truly populated by Gondor and was soon abandoned.\n-   Rhovanion, which was never fully under the control of Gondor but\n    under Gondorian control at certain times during the Third Age.\n-   Ephel Dúath, the Mountains of Shadow, which was the extreme eastern\n    region of Gondor where she kept watch over Mordor with many\n    fortresses and cities such as Minas Ithil, Durthang, and the Tower\n    of Cirith Ungol. Evil things re-entered Mordor after Gondor's watch\n    upon the land slackened during the Second Age.\n\n\nMajor Sites\n\n Cities, Fortresses, and Strongholds in Gondor included:\n\n-   Cair Andros, an island-fortress in the river Anduin, roughly 40\n    miles north of Osgiliath. Gondor maintained a steady garrison here,\n    as it was of paramount importance to Gondor during the long war with\n    Mordor, in order to prevent the enemy from crossing the river and\n    entering into Anórien.\n\n\n\n-   Calembel, a city in Lamedon.\n-   Dol Amroth, a city in Belfalas ruled by the Prince of Dol Amroth.\n-   Ethring, a ford and a large township built on either side of the\n    river Ringló.\n-   Henneth Annûn, a hidden refuge of Gondorian rangers in the northern\n    part of Ithilien along the Ephel Duath, the Mountains of Shadow.\n-   Linhir, a port city in Lebennin.\n-   Minas Tirith (originally Minas Anor), City of the Kings, the capital\n    (Third Age) and largest city of Gondor.\n-   Osgiliath, a city and former capital of Gondor on the river Anduin,\n    largely destroyed and abandoned by the end of the Third Age. During\n    the War of the Ring, Gondor kept a garrison on the west bank to\n    prevent the Enemy from crossing the river and assaulting Minas\n    Tirith. Osigiliath was the key to besiege Minas Tirith because of\n    its location and access to the river. Although the massive\n    Morgul-host led by the Witch-King to beseige Minas Tirith\n    overwhelmed the garrison, and drove the Gondorians out thus gaining\n    the passage of Anduin- the true beginning of the Siege of Gondor\n    that would conclude at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. King\n    Elessar had it rebuilt after Sauron's downfall.\n-   Pelargir, the great southern harbour, which was captured by the\n    Corsairs during the War of the Ring. The people of Pelargir helped\n    in the Batttle of Pell\n-   Tarnost, a hill-town in Belfalas.\n\nAdditionally, Gondor had held the following locations at certain points\nin its history:\n\n-   Angrenost (Isengard), one of the three Fortresses of Gondor and held\n    within it one of the realm's Palantiri. Its location in Nan\n    Curunir (valley at the end of the Misty Mountains), was at the\n    northwestern corner of the Southern Kingdom of Gondor, guarding the\n    Fords of Isen from enemy incursions into Calenardhon, and together\n    with the fortress of Helm's Deep to its south protected the Gap of\n    Rohan. After Calenardhon was given to the Éothéod by Cirion, Steward\n    of Gondor and became Rohan, Isengard remained part of Gondor, and\n    the company of Aglarond removed to the northern fortress, although\n    the rest of Gondor almost forgot about it. The small guard\n    intermarried much with the Dunlendings , until the place became a\n    Dunlending fortress in all but name. Orthanc, however, remained\n    closed, as the Steward of Gondor still held the keys. Isengard soon\n    came all but deserted.\n-   Durthang, the largest fortress in Mordor, originally built to guard\n    the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow)..\n-   Erech, a town of Gondor that was abandoned by the end of the Third\n    Age. To the north lay the Paths of the Dead.\n-   Minas Ithil, a city founded by Isildur that was originally the\n    sister city of Minas Anor. Located in an upland valley at the feet\n    of the Mountains of Shadow, it was built as a fortress city to\n    defend Gondor from Sauron in Mordor. It was later conquered by\n    the Nazgûl and renamed Minas Morgul.\n-   Tharbad, a city on both sides of the river Greyflood, (at one time\n    held by Gondor in the south and Arnor in the north) but abandoned as\n    Gondor's borders recessed through Enedwaith to the Isen, and later\n    ruined.\n-   Tower of Cirith Ungol, a Tower Fortress in western Mordor built by\n    Gondor to guard the pass of Cirith Ungol from any evil creature\n    trying to enter -or leave- Mordor. The Great Plague wiped out the\n    garrison located here, so it was easily captured when Sauron's\n    minions re-entered Mordor.\n-   Towers of the Teeth, two towers situated on either side of the Black\n    Gate. The two towers, called Carchost and Narchost, that stand on\n    either side of Cirith Gorgor, the Haunted Pass, which lies between\n    the Ephel Dúath (Mountains of Shadow), and the Ash\n    Mountains. Originally built by Men of Gondor following the downfall\n    of Sauron at the end of the Second Age, the Towers of the Teeth were\n    eventually taken over by the servants of the Dark Lord. They were\n    then repaired and fortified and were incorporated into the defenses\n    of the pass and gate.\n-   Umbar, the far southern harbour which was lost and reclaimed several\n    times, in the end being the home of Black Númenóreans, the Corsairs\n    of Umbar.\n\n\nTrivia\n\n-   Gondor draws heavy influence from the real medieval Byzantine\n    Empire; both had numerous enemies (Gondor faced the Haradrim,\n    Easterlings and Sauron's forces, the Byzantine Empire faced the\n    Persians, Turks, and on occasion the Catholic West) and both were in\n    a state of decline on the eve of a final, dramatic siege on their\n    capital that would determine the fate of the Empire/Kingdom, though\n    Minas Tirith survived and Constantinople did not. Tolkien wrote a\n    letter in 1951 describing the “Byzantine City of Minas Tirith”. They\n    were also the only surviving remnants of their respective Empires\n    (Western Rome having fallen almost a millennia before the East, with\n    a similar time-scale for Arnor before Gondor).\n    -   This influence is echoed in Peter Jackson's film adaptation -\n        Byzantine domes were incorporated into the architecture of Minas\n        Tirith, the civilians wore Byzantine attire, and Minas Tirith's\n        soldiers were based on pre-11th century Byzantine infantry."

    "text": "Various LANGUAGES are used in J.R.R. Tolkien's writings about\nMiddle-earth, including _The Hobbit_, _The Lord of the Rings_ trilogy,\nand _The Silmarillion_. The creation of the mythology that manifests in\nthose works began with Tolkien's passion for language in general  and\nfor philology, which is the branch of knowledge dealing with the\nstructure, historical development, and relationships of existing\nlanguages. Creating languages was a major early pastime of Tolkien's,\never since his years as a youth.\n\nWhen discussing the languages of Middle-earth, it is necessary to\nconsider two aspects: their “primary world” history, namely their\nliteral development by Tolkien as a linguist, and their “secondary\nworld” history, their imagined historical development in the history of\nMiddle-earth.\n\n\nPrimary-world history\n\nTolkien was a professional linguist and a specialist in the Old English\nlanguage. He was also interested in many languages outside his field and\ndeveloped a particular love for the Finnish language (he described the\nfinding of a Finnish grammar book as “entering a complete wine-cellar\nfilled with bottles of an amazing wine of a kind and flavour never\ntasted before”).\n\nFinnish morphology (particularly its rich system of inflection) in part\ngave rise to Quenya. Another of Tolkien's favorites was Welsh — and\nfeatures of Welsh phonology found their way to Sindarin. Numerous words\nwere borrowed from existing languages, but less and less obviously as\nTolkien progressed, such that attempts to match a source to a particular\nElvish word or name in works published during his lifetime are often\nvery dubious.\n\nLanguage-making was Tolkien's hobby for most of his life. He is known to\nhave constructed his first languages (_Animalic_ and _Nevbosh_) at a\nlittle over thirteen years of age, and he continued to ponder upon his\ncreations up until his death more than sixty-five years later. Language\ninvention had always been tightly connected to the mythology that\nTolkien developed, as he found that a language could not be complete\nwithout the history of the people who spoke it.\n\nAlthough the Elvish languages Sindarin and Quenya are the most famous\nand the most mature languages of those that Tolkien invented for his\nmythology, they were not near to the only ones. They belong to a family\nof Elvish dialects that originate in Common Eldarin, the language common\nto all Eldar, which in turn originated in “Primitive Quendian”, the\ncommon root of Eldarin and Avarin languages. In addition, there is a\nseparate language family spoken by Men, the most prominent member of\nwhich was Westron (derived from the Númenórean speech Adûnaic) or the\n“Common speech” of the peoples of _The Lord of the Rings_. Most Mannish\ntongues showed influences by Elvish, as well as some Dwarvish\ninfluences. Several independent languages were drafted as well, for\nexample the Khuzdul language of the Dwarves. Other languages are Valarin\n(the tongue of the Valar), and the Black Speech created by Sauron during\nthe Second Age.\n\nElvish scholarship\n\nAlthough the study of Tolkien's languages is as a rule not taken\nseriously by mainstream linguistics, a number of serious scholars have\nworked on compiling all that can be recovered about their histories and\ngrammars. An early book dedicated to Eldarin is _An Introduction to\nElvish_ by Jim Allan (published by Bran's Head Books), written before\nthe publication of _The Silmarillion_ in 1977 and therefore mostly\noutdated.\n\nThere are several journals dedicated to the subject:\n\n-   _Quettar_, Bulletin of the Linguistic Fellowship of The Tolkien\n    Society, edited by Julian C. Bradfield, the oldest Eldarin\n    publication.\n-   _Vinyar Tengwar_ and _Parma Eldalamberon_ are published by the\n    Elvish Linguistic Fellowship.\n-   _Tyalie Tyelellieva_ is published by Lisa Star.\n-   _Mythlore_ is published by the Mythopoeic Society.\n-   _Beyond Bree_ is published by Nancy Martsch.\n-   Tolklang, Elfling, and Lambengolmor are mailing lists dedicated to\n    Tolkien linguistics.\n\n\nSecondary-world history\n\n_See also Lhammas and Elvish language_.\n\nIn the fictitious history of Middle-earth, the tongues of the Elves are\nseparated as part of the speakers emigrate to Aman while others stay\nbehind, leading to a split of Quenya (High-Elvish, or “Elf-Latin”) and\nSindarin.\n\nMiddle-earth linguistics\n\nThe invention of writing is attributed to Rúmil, who first invented an\nalphabet: the _Sarati_ (literally “letters”). Fëanor later enhanced and\nfurther developed this alphabet into the Tengwar, which were spread to\nMiddle-earth by the Ñoldor and remained “commonly used in the\nWest-lands” by the Third Age. Daeron of Doriath, independently of\nRúmil and Fëanor, had invented the Cirth runes, but these were only used\nfor inscriptions, and otherwise were replaced by the use of tengwar,\nexcept for among the Dwarves.\n\nAn important source of Middle-earth linguistic scholarship is Pengolodh\nof Gondolin, a lore-master who wrote in Quenya and in Sindarin. He is\nthe author of _Quendi and Eldar_, the ''Lhammas ''(by attribution), and\nthe _Osanwe-kenta_; and was the last of the _Lambengolmor_.\n\nIn Quenya, _lambë_, the chief root of the term “Lambengolmor”, is the\nterm for spoken language or verbal communication. _tengwesta_ is a more\nabstract term for a system or a code of signs and may be translated as\n“grammar”.\n\n\nWriting and spelling\n\nSindarin and Quenya are often written in the _tengwar_ script, which\nTolkien especially devised for them, or alternatively in the rune-like\n_cirth_. When Middle-earth languages are written with the Latin\nalphabet, either acute accents (á, é, í, ó, ú) or circumflex accents (â,\nê, î, ô, û, ŷ) mark long vowels depending on language or other\nconvention. The diaeresis (ä, ë, ö) is normally used to mark that a\nshort vowel is to be separately pronounced, that it is not silent or\npart of a diphthong. For example, the last four letters of _Ainulindalë_\nshould be sounded as if spelled _dah-leh_ in English rather than as\n_dale_ and the first three letters of _Eärendil_ represent _eh-ahr_\nrather than the English word _ear_. (But occasionally, especially when\nwriting proto-Eldarin forms, Tolkien used the macron to indicate long\nvowels and the dieresis on ä, ö, and ü as in German to indicate\n_i_-modification or _e_-modification.)\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings_, Tolkien adopted the literary device of\nclaiming to have replaced the original Westron with English. This\ndevice of rendering an _imaginary_ language with a _real_ language he\ncarried further, rendering Rohirric, related to an older form of\nWestron, by Old English, and names in the tongue of Dale in the north of\nRhovanion by Old Norse forms, thus mapping the genetic relation of his\nfictional languages on the existing historical relations of the Germanic\nlanguages. A natural consequence of this is that Tolkien never worked\nout the languages thus ‘’replaced’’ in any detail because they never\nappeared in the texts.\n\n\nList of languages\n\n1.

    "text": "The VALAR (Quenya; singular\nVALA) were the _Powers of Arda_ who lived on the Western continent of\nAman.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Valar were the fourteen Ainur who, after being molded of Eru's\nthought, entered Arda after its creation, to give order to the world and\ncombat the new evils of Melkor. They had helped to begin the shaping of\nArda through the music of Ilúvatar, and often referred to one another as\n“brother” or “sister”. Each of the Ainur had added his or her own part\nto the music creating the world incarnate, save for Melkor, who at the\ntime was counted as the strongest of them. His vision of what Arda\nshould have been differed from Eru's, which led to his banishment and\ngreat rebellion that would cause most of the ills of the world of Arda.\n The fourteen Valar originally dwelt on\nAlmaren, a hidden island on the “Great Lake”, but after it was destroyed\nand the earth was reshaped, long before the Awakening of the Elves, they\nrelocated to Aman and founded the realm of Valinor. They would become\nknown as the 'Powers of the World', though rarely directly intervening\nin the world's course of events. Eru instead gave them delegation of\nArda, and so at Valinor they constructed the golden city of Valimar,\ntheir own mansions dispersed cross the plain; and Máhanaxar, the “Ring\nof Doom”, at which they would confer and hold counsels.\n\nEru created for them lesser heavenly beings named the 'Maiar', who were\ntheir servants. Though subordinate to the Valar, the Maiar were powerful\nnonetheless, and included Melian, Sauron (named _Mairon_), Olórin (later\nnamed _Gandalf_) and the other Istari, and those who would become the\nBalrogs. Most Maiar were associated with particular Valar: Ossë and\nUinen, the “powers of the oceans”, served under Ulmo, while Curumo (much\nlater known as _Saruman_), served Aulë the Smith. Sauron also served\nAulë before he was corrupted by Melkor.\n\nIt was originally Melkor's intention to rule Arda for himself, but\nManwë, the superior of the Valar, called other spirits to help him\nconfront Melkor. (Among these were the other Valar and the Maiar.)\nMelkor withdrew from Arda after the short War for Sake of the Elves, and\nthe Valar continued their creation and furnishing of the World, while\nMelkor plotted to return and regain dominance. In time, once he returned\nin secret and ruined the Two Trees of Valinor with Ungoliant, Valinor\nlost its light, and the Valar eventually set to creating the Sun and\nMoon in the sky.  The War\nof the Jewels was prompted after Fëanor refused to forfeit his Silmarils\nto the Valar, for the rekindling of the Two Trees. He ended his and the\nÑoldor's allegiance with the Valar, and bore a new conflict between the\nElves and Melkor. The Valar soon fortified their realm, and brought\nabout the “Hiding of Valinor”, preventing Melkor and Fëanor and his\nfollowers from entering. The conflict between Melkor and the Valar was\nnot resolved until the war's climax, during which the Valar came\nphysically into Beleriand, helped conquer Melkor's forces at Angband,\nand captured him. He was taken to Aman and cast behind the Door of\nNight.\n\nIn the Second Age, the Valar created anew the island of Elenna in the\nmiddle of the Sea, for the noble peoples of the Edain who had resisted\nand endured the war against Melkor. On this island was established the\nkingdom of Númenor, which lasted three millennia until their king\nAr-Pharazôn attempted to contravene the Ban of the Valar. The Valar sank\nthe island, and the living Númenóreans sailed eastward, and settled\nMiddle-earth.\n\nOnce Sauron had begun to regain power in Middle-earth after his defeat\nin the War of the Last Alliance, the Valar sent an order of five Maiar,\nthe “Istari”, unto Middle-earth, to provide a strong opposition to\nSauron until his final destruction.\n\n\nNames\n\n\n\nThese are the names of the Valar as they were known to the Eldar. In\nMiddle-earth, they were known by other names of Sindarin origin; for\nexample they called Varda Elbereth. Men knew them by many other names,\nand sometimes worshiped them as Gods. The Elves called Varda, the\ncreator of the stars, ELENTÁRI. The dwarves called Aulë, their creator,\nMAHAL. The Ents called Yavanna, their creator, KEMENTÁRI. It should be\nnoted that, with the exception of Oromë, the names listed below are not\nactual names but rather titles: the true names of the Valar are nowhere\nrecorded. Male Valar are called “Lords of the Valar”; females are called\n“Ladies of the Valar,” or VALIER. Among these exist six married couples,\nwith only Ulmo and Nienna remaining single. \n\nLords of the Valar\n\n-   Manwë Súlimo, the Wind-king and the King of the Valar.\n-   Morgoth Bauglir, the Lord and Creator of Dark Powers who, when he\n    was counted as a Valar, was most powerful of them\n-   Ulmo, the Sea-king and the Lord of Water\n-   Aulë, the Smith and the Lord of Earth and all that's underneath\n-   Oromë Aldaron, the Huntsman, the Lord of Forests and the Great Rider\n    (husband of Vána)\n-   Námo (Mandos), the Doomsman and the Judge of the Dead (husband of\n    Vairë)\n-   Irmo (Lórien), Lord and Master of Dreams, Visions, and Desires, and\n    Creator of the Oloré Mallé, or Path of Dreams (husband of Estë).\n-   Tulkas Astaldo, the Wrestler, the Champion of Valinor, and last of\n    the Valar to come to Arda (husband of Nessa)\n\n\n\nLadies of the Valar\n\n-   Varda Elentári, the Star-queen and the Queen of the Valar\n-   Yavanna Kementári , the Fruit-Giver and the Lady of Earth\n-   Nienna, the Weeper and the Lady of Mercy\n-   Estë the Gentle, Lady of Healing and Rest, and spouse of Irmo\n-   Vairë, the Weaver and spouse of Mandos\n-   Vána, the Ever-young and spouse of Oromë\n-   Nessa, the Dancer and spouse of Tulkas\n\nOther names\n\nThe ARATAR (Sindarin: _Exalted_) or HIGH ONES OF ARDA were the eight\ngreatest of the Valar: Manwë, Varda, Ulmo, Yavanna, Aulë, Mandos,\nNienna, and Oromë. Melkor, the most powerful of all, is not counted\namong them. Lórien and Mandos were brothers, and would be referred to\ntogether as the _FËANTURI_ or “Masters of Spirits”.\n\nIn earlier versions of the legendarium, “GODS” was a word used often to\nrefer to them , and VALUR and VALIR for a short time denoted male and\nfemale Valar.\n\n\nPowers and abilities\n\nAs with the other Ainur, the powers of the Valar were very mysterious or\nambiguous.\n\nThe Valar appear to have had similar, though superior, abilities to the\nMaiar, such as the control of light and of fire. Clear abilities\nincluded shifting forms and placing Man or Elves in a trance with their\npresence. Manwë and Ulmo could both control and perceive massive volumes\nof matter at once, perhaps giving evidence of advanced intelligence.\nYavanna and Nessa’s efforts combined could create Laurelin, a tree which\nhad at the very least thousands of Sun-like flowers, and Telperion,\nwhich produced light “for millions of stars”. Varda could lift enormous\nstars weighing billions of metric exatons, on which speculation is based\nthat she, if not all Valar, could move at any desired speed through\nspace."

    "text": "VALINOR (Quenya; IPA: ; also\nVALINÓRË; ; meaning _Land of the Valar_), the Land_' across the Sea_',\nwas the realm of the Valar in Aman; the place to which they migrated\nafter being driven from Almaren by Melkor in times before the First Age.\nIt was also known as the Undying Lands as only immortal souls were\nallowed to reside there, with some exceptions when it came to the\nbearers of the One Ring; and additionally, even Gimli, who accompanied\nhis friend Legolas to these lands.\n\n\nLay of the land\n\nIts major city was Valmar, where the Vanyar and the Valar resided. Two\nother cities were Alqualondë and Tirion, the respective homes of the\nTeleri and the Noldor. It also had an island, Tol Eressëa, just off its\neast coast.\n\nValinor as explained was the home of the Valar, the Powers of\nMiddle-earth. The sea to the west of the island was called Ekkaia, or\nthe Encircling Sea; it surrounded both Valinor and Middle-earth.\n\nEach of the Valar had their own region of the land where they resided\nand altered things to their desire. Yavanna, the Vala of nature, growth,\nand harvest, resided in the Pastures of Yavanna in the south of the\nisland. Orome, the Vala of the hunt, lived in the Woods of Orome to the\nnorth-east of the pastures. The forest was home to many creatures which\nOrome could track and hunt. Nienna, the lonely Vala of sorrow and\nendurance lived cut off in the far west of the island in the Halls of\nNienna where she spent her days crying, looking out to sea. Just south\nof the Halls of Nienna and to the north of the pastures there were the\nHalls of Mandos. Mandos, the brother of Nienna, was the Vala of the\nafterlife. All inhabitants of Middle-earth went to the Halls of Mandos\nshould they happen to die, mortals and immortals alike (immortals could\nbe killed although they did not die of old age) although it was said\nthat in death as in life, they were separated. Also living in the Halls\nof Mandos was his spouse Vairë the weaver, who wove the threads of time.\n\nTo the east of the Halls of Mandos was the Isle of Estë, which was\nsituated in the middle of the lake of Lorellin which in turn was\nsituated to the north of the Gardens of Lórien (not to be confused with\nLothlórien in Middle-earth which was created by the same Valar, Lórien\nalso known as Irmo, the Vala of dreams). Este and Lórien being husband\nand wife lived close together. To the north of this were the Mansions of\nAule the smith Valar who was spouse to Yavanna. In the north-east lay\nthe Mansions of Manwe and Varda, the two most powerful Valar, also\nmarried. To the west of them stood the Trees of Valinor, Telperion and\nLaurelin. The entire great island of Valinor was surrounded on three\nsides (excluding the north which was instead protected by ices flows) by\na huge mountain range called the Pelóri mountains. In the extreme\nnorth-east, past the mountain range was the pass of Helcaraxë, a vast\nand treacherous ice sheet which in the beginning, before the fall of\nNúmenor, joined the two continents of Valinor and Middle-earth. In the\nbeginning, the Noldor, tricked by the evil Vala Melkor passed along this\npass to go back to Middle-earth, among those was Galadriel who was\nfeatured in the War of the Ring. Those who took this pass were not\nallowed back to Valinor for many years, but in the end pity was taken on\nthem when Middle-earth began to fade and pass into the age of men and\nthey were allowed to pass back to the Undying Lands of their own accord\nwhen they felt ready to do so.\n\nAlso, for a time after the exile of the Noldor and before the ruin of\nNúmenor, a long chain of small islands called the Enchanted Isles ran\nthe full length of the east coast to the continent. The enchanted\nislands and a bewildering shadow created the Shadowy Seas, which to\nprevent mariner, mortal or immortal, from reaching the land by sea (by\nthe Belegaer, the Great Sea which separated Middle-earth and Valinor.\nUntil the Changing of the World in the center of this sea was the isle\nof Númenor. This defence lasted centuries until Eärendil was guided\nthrough the Shadowy Seas by the light of the Silmaril brought on board\nby his wife Elwing. They sailed on Vingilot, said to be the fairest ship\never fashioned, constructed by Earendil and Cirdan the shipwright.\n\nAfter the destruction of Númenor and the Changing of the World, the\nUndying Lands were no longer a physical part of Arda so that Men could\nno longer sail to Aman or Tol Eressea. Only the Elves could sail there\nby the Straight Road and in ships capable of passing out of the Spheres\nof the earth.\n\nBy special permission of the Valar, the Hobbits Frodo Baggins, Bilbo\nBaggins, and Samwise Gamgee were also permitted to go to Valinor, and\nLegolas the elf brought with him Gimli the Dwarf.\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nIt has been suggested that the concept was based off Hy Brasil, a\nmythical land that can reputedly be seen off the coast of Ireland for\none day in every seven years, or alternatively “Heaven”, the latter is\nmore possible as Valinor being peaceful is similar to how Heaven is\nrepresented and Middle Earth being violent is similar to how Earth is\nrepresented."

    "text": "The WAR OF THE RING was fought between Sauron and the free people of\nMiddle-earth for control of the One Ring and dominion over the\ncontinent. It took place at the end of the Third Age. Together with the\nQuest of Mount Doom, it is one of the overarching plot-lines of _The\nLord of the Rings_.\n\nThe war was initiated by Sauron, who had gained strength since the end\nof the Second Age and sought the One Ring. During the War of the Ring,\nmany thousands of Men of Rohan and Men of Gondor were killed. The\noverall number of combatants in the war is estimated to be over one\nmillion—tens of thousands from the side of the Free Peoples and hundreds\nof thousands from the Evil side. The war also signified the decline of\nthe Elves' power in Middle-earth, the rise of Men in the West, the\nrestoration of the King of Gondor and Arnor and the start of the Fourth\nAge.\n\nBattles were fought in Gondor, Rohan, Lórien, Mirkwood, at the Lonely\nMountain and at Dale. These were primarily waged against Sauron's\nforces, but Saruman, a third contender, also had armies, who fought\nbattles at the Fords of Isen and Helm's Deep.\n\nThe first full-scale battle fought in the war was the first Battle of\nthe Fords of Isen, and the war ended after the Battle of Bywater and,\nshortly afterwards, the deaths of Saruman and Gríma Wormtongue. Towards\nthe end of the War of the Ring, Elessar was crowned King of Gondor, and\nforgave the Men who had fought under Sauron, heralding a great renewal\nof cooperation and communication between Men, Elves, and Dwarves.\n\n\nOrigins of the War\n\nAccording to Mithrandir, the War of the Ring had begun at the\ntime Thorin Oakenshield met Bilbo Baggins in The Shire. Gandalf's\nreasoning is explained in the book _Unfinished Tales_. This is an\nexcerpt from a narrative of Gandalf to Frodo set in a house in Minas\nTirith. “_You may think that Rivendell was out of his reach, but I did\nnot think so. The state of things in the North was very bad. The Kingdom\nUnder the Mountain and the Strong Men of Dale were no more. To resist\nany force that Sauron might send North to regain Angmar were only the\nDwarves of the Iron Hills, and behind them lay desolation and a Dragon.\nThe Dragon Sauron might use with terrible effect._” That is why Gandalf\nthought that he had to get rid of Smaug, and he chanced upon Thorin and\nBilbo at different times, and saw the way to do it, which is told in\n_The Hobbit_.\n\nGandalf's role\n\nGandalf was to the Free Peoples of Middle-earth as a field marshal is to\nhis army fighting on the field—a master strategist and tactician. As\nseen in the opening stages of _The Fellowship of the Ring_ book and\nmovie, Gandalf the Grey would spend many hours, searching, scavenging,\nand sifting out archaic maps and accounts in long-hidden archives strewn\nabout Middle-earth. He would often carefully examine them, figuring out\nthe best way to defeat the Enemy and marshal as many allies as possible\nto his cause.\n\nGandalf likely spent much thought in strategy, before implementing his\nplans to maximum effect. He had been roaming Middle-earth for many years\nduring the Third Age, before Sauron's power was at its apex. He might\nhave had a 'hit list' of targets to neutralize that Sauron might use in\nthe next war upon the Free Peoples. One of these targets was Smaug, as\nseen in _The Hobbit._\n\nGandalf's adaptability and aptitude for strategy proved invaluable to\nhis allies during the complicated web that was to prove to become the\nWar of the Ring. As told in _Unfinished Tales_, Gandalf had known for\nquite a while that Sauron's use of Smaug would virtually guarantee\nvictory over his enemies, namely those of Gondor. He and his Dwarf\ncompanions thus set out to destroy Smaug, and bring the victory of the\nWar of the Ring one step closer for the Free Peoples.\n\nThe Roles of the other Istari\n\nSaruman became the secondary enemy in the War of the Ring, originally\nhaving served the Free Peoples and eventually succumbing to the power of\nthe One Ring.\n\nThe two Blue Wizards, Alatar and Pallando, also served an important role\nin the outcome of the war. Although they weren't directly mentioned in\nthe _Lord of the Rings_, they were enemies of Sauron, and might have\nused the Dark Elves and the Dwarves of the Red Mountains to weaken the\nEasterlings.\n\n\nEvents\n\nSouthern Theatre\n\nThe objective of Sauron's grand strategy was to defeat the strongest of\nthe nations that opposed him, Gondor, and to do so he would need to take\nthe capital city and greatest fortress of Gondor, Minas Tirith. To this\nend, the war effort of Mordor was focused in the south in and around\nGondor, in a strategy of divide and conquer. To keep Gondor's ally\nRohan, on its northern border, from sending aid, Sauron promoted the\nrise of Saruman at Isengard to the west of Rohan. Thus all of Rohan's\nforces would be focused in the west trying to stem the tide of the\nIsengard attack, and none would be sent to Minas Tirith's defence.\nMeanwhile, Sauron sent the Mordor-allied Corsairs of Umbar to attack\nGondor's populous southern coastal fiefs, which as a result sent only a\nfraction of their forces to defend Minas Tirith in northern Gondor,\nwhile the rest stayed on the coasts preparing for the Corsair assault.\nHowever, Sauron's divide and conquer strategy was ultimately foiled and\na united front of Gondor and Rohan's forces faced Mordor.\n\nRohan\n\nThe War of the Ring started in Rohan when Saruman's troops crossed the\nFords of Isen. Théodred, the son of the King Théoden, had mustered his\nforces on the fords in order to launch a surprise attack against the\nenemy. On February 23, 3019 he attacked the vanguard of the Orcs\nmarching out of Isengard. Reinforcements were quickly sent from Isengard\nhowever, and Théodred ordered a retreat. His forces retreated to an\nisland in the fords, but they were soon surrounded and he was killed.\nGrimbold managed to hold the island, but would not have succeeded if\nElfhelm had not come with reinforcements from Helm's Deep. Thus the\nfirst battle of the Fords of Isen ended in victory for the Rohirrim.\n\nNow that the Marshal of the Westmark was dead, Erkenbrand took command\nof the Westfold. He placed Grimbold and Elfhelm at the Fords. However,\nthey were unable to withstand the force of Isengard, and were\nsurrounded. Though they successfully broke through the enemy's lines,\nthey ended up scattered around the Westfold, giving Saruman clear\npassage into Rohan.\n\nMeanwhile, Gandalf drove Gríma Wormtongue out of Edoras and went to\ngather Erkenbrand's scattered forces, advising King Théoden to move to\nthe stronghold of Helm's Deep. The king and his forces arrived\nunmolested, but soon the fortress was surrounded by Saruman's troops.\nAll through the night of March 3rd-4th a combined force of Orcs and Wild\nMen from Dunland besieged Helm's Deep, and despite the efforts of the\nRohirrim (aided by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli) hope appeared lost.\nBelieving Rohan was lost, Théoden decided to mount a final, suicidal\ncharge against Saruman's forces. Unexpectedly, however, Gandalf arrived\nin the nick of time with Erkenbrand and the scattered Rohirrim, along\nwith a forest of Huorns who had been sent to the battle by Treebeard.\nThe Orcs were trapped and utterly annihilated. The wild Men were taken\ncaptive, however, were freed after swearing an oath of loyalty to Rohan\nand clearing the battlefield of the dead. (The mercy of this act amazed\nthe captives, who had been told by Saruman that the men of Rohan were\ncruel and burned their captives alive.)\n\nDays before, at an Entmoot in Fangorn Forest, the Ents, furious over the\ndestruction Saruman had wrought upon the forest, decided to march on\nIsengard. They were to move up to Isengard and destroy it. By 3 March\nthe destruction was completed, and the command of Isengard was taken by\nthe Ent Treebeard. At Gandalf's request he sent a large herd of Huorns\nto the Battle of Hornburg, to aid the Rohirrim.\n\nGondor\n\nFor over 3000 years, the realm of Gondor had held back the threat from\nthe East. In time, the kingdom declined, and Sauron prepared to swoop in\nfor the kill. Faramir, captain of Gondor, had divided his forces to too\nmany fronts. The two most important of these were in the island citadel\nof Cair Andros and the ruined city of Osgiliath. In a strict sense, the\nWar of the Ring began with the Great Signal from Minas Morgul and the\nanswering signal from Mount Doom, and thus the attack on Osgiliath was\nthe first battle of the war proper. Sauron's two armies obliterated the\nfortresses, and Faramir was forced to retreat to the causeway forts, the\nlast defence against the Morgul forces. Soon these too were destroyed,\nand only Minas Tirith remained.\n\nThe attack soon began, as the Nazgûl hovered above and spread terror and\nconfusion, and siege towers tried to take the walls but were all\ndestroyed. After several repulsed attacks, the Gate of Minas Tirith was\nbroken, and the Lord of the Nazgûl entered. He was the first and only\nenemy to do so. All seemed lost — until six thousand Rohirrim, under\nKing Théoden's command, came and somewhat relieved Gondor's defenders.\nStill, the battle was in doubt until Aragorn arrived with a large force\nout of South Gondor. The joint force of Gondor and Rohan then\nsuccessfully defeated their enemies after an exhausting day of fighting.\nThis battle resulted in the deaths of the Witch-king of Angmar, King\nTheoden, and Denethor, Steward of Gondor.\n\nThe Battle of the Morannon was the final major battle against Sauron in\nthe War of the Ring, fought at the Black Gate of Mordor. The Army of the\nWest, roughly 6,000 strong, led by Aragorn marched on the gate and faced\na vastly larger force as a diversionary feint to distract Sauron's\nattention from Frodo and Sam, who were carrying the One Ring through\nMordor. It was hoped that Sauron would think Aragorn had the Ring and\nwas now trying to use it to overthrow Mordor. Despite the seemingly\nimpossible odds the Army of the West was eventually victorious, for when\nthe Ring was destroyed, Sauron's forces fled or surrendered in dismay.\n\nNorthern Theatre\n\nMordor's war effort was focused in the south against Gondor, but using\nhis outstretched right arm Sauron attempted to flank the lands of the\nFree Peoples through Rhovanion, using orcs and allied barbarian nations\nof Men. In this theatre of the war (which had spread far across\nMiddle-earth) Sauron's primary objective was to use the forces at his\nprimary base of operations in the area, Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood,\nto defeat Lothlórien, then pass the Misty Mountains (attacking\nRivendell), and wheel around to take Rohan and Gondor from the rear.\nHowever, Dol Guldur had to deal with the threat of the Woodland Realm of\nThranduil, and thus split their forces between the attack on Lothlórien\nand the one on the Woodland Realm. Sauron wanted to use his barbarian\nEasterling allies in a joint attack with the Orcs from Dol Guldur on the\nWoodland Realm, and then have this victorious army link up with the\nother ones attacking Lothlórien and defeat it. However, unfortunately\nfor Sauron a strong and extremely powerful Dwarf nation now existed at\nthe Lonely Mountain thanks to the efforts of Gandalf, as well as the\nDwarves of the Iron Hills and allied Men of Dale. Mordor's Easterling\nallies were tied up fighting the Dwarves of Erebor and Men of Dale,and\nnever linked up with the Mordor forces assaulting the Woodland Realm,\nwhich in turn could not link up with those attacking Lothlórien, and the\nline held.\n\nBridging the gap between the northern and southern theatres of the war\nwas the line of the River Anduin between Lothlórien and Gondor, running\nalong the Rohan border. Orc armies peeling off from the assault on\nLothlórien tried to enter Rohan via this route, while almost its entire\narmy had left to fight at Minas Tirith, but the Ents of Fangorn forest\ncounterattacked and drove the orcs back in a panic, and most if not all\ndrowned while attempting to flee by crossing the river.\n\nDale and the Lonely Mountain\n\nWhen the war began, the Dwarves of Erebor\nrefused to cooperate with Sauron in his hunt for the Ring. And so Sauron\nsent an army of Easterlings to Dale. On March 17 they met the armies of\nthe Dwarves of Erebor (and of the Iron Hills as well) and the Men of\nDale. After three days of fighting, Men and Dwarves were overrun, Dale\nwas sacked and razed to ash (the second, possibly third, time in a\ncentury) and sought refuge in Erebor. The defenses of the Lonely\nMountain were prepared for the battle that would decide the fate of\nnorthern Middle-earth, and possibly even the War of the Ring itself.\n\nThe Easterlings hurled their full force at the allied armies, exploiting\ntheir dreaded heavy infantry force to punch a hole in the Dwarvish and\nMannish lines. A furious melee ensued, evolving into a tempest of fire,\ndead and dying men, and the flash of steel. Both sides took horrendous\nlosses, the Easterlings from the arrows, spears, and rocks cast from the\nLonely Mountain's cliffs, and the Men and Dwarves from the scimitars and\nmaces of the Easterlings. Finally, King Brand of Dale fell before the\ngate of the Lonely Mountain, and King under the Mountain Dáin II\nIronfoot fell as he was defending Brand's body.\n\nThe Dwarves of Erebor had learnt a crucial lesson from the devastation\nof Smaug and the Battle of the Five Armies nearly a century earlier, a\nlesson bought with the blood of loved ones. They fortified all of the\nsides of the Lonely Mountain, preventing the breakthrough of orcs that\nnearly caused the loss of the Battle in the days of Bilbo Baggins and\nThorin Oakenshield. The defenders knew with grim fatalism that there\nwould be no Beorn and no Eagles to save them this time, and they were\nthus determined to fight to the last. The Lonely Mountain was staged to\nbecome the Minas Tirith of the North, a ruthless battle of the will of\nthe defender and the will of the aggressor.\n\nThe invaders from the east constructed siege works, battering rams, and\nassorted siege catapults to bombard their enemies into submission.\nHowever, despite all of their efforts, the great gates of the Lonely\nMountain withstood the tidal wave of invaders from the East. Many Men\nand Dwarves made their escape to Erebor however and were able to\nwithstand the siege of the mountain fastness. When news spread about the\nvictory in the South, the Easterlings became extremely demoralized and\nproceeded to scatter, while the sons of Brand and Dáin let their army\nout of Erebor to break the encirclement.\n\nLothlórien and Mirkwood\n\nOn March 11, Lothlórien was first attacked from Dol Guldur. It was\nattacked two further times, on the 15 and the 22. When the Dark Lord had\nfallen, Celeborn led his army out of Lóerin, and crossed the Anduin. Dol\nGuldur was captured and destroyed by Galadriel.\n\nThranduil of Mirkwood was also attacked from Dol Guldur on March 15\nresulting in the long Battle Under the Trees, in which Thranduil's\nkinfolk won a hard victory. After the destruction of Dol Guldur,\nCeleborn met Thranduil on April 6, and as the shadow had passed, they\ndivided Mirkwood and renamed it Eryn Lasgalen.\n\nThe Shire\n\nAfter the defeat of the Dark Lord, Saruman used the magic of his voice\nto convince Treebeard to release him from Isengard. He travellled to the\nShire, where he replaced Lotho Sackville-Baggins as the Chief under the\nname _Sharkey_. Under his command Ruffian men entered The Shire and\nruined it. They were defeated by Hobbits under the lead of Meriadoc\nBrandybuck and Peregrin Took in the Battle of Bywater on the 3rd of\nNovember. The Hobbits headed to Hobbiton where Frodo ordered Saruman and\nWormtongue to leave the Shire. Wormtongue, however, killed Saruman,\nbefore he himself was killed by the Hobbits and their arrows. With the\ndeath of the wizard Saruman, the War of the Ring finally ended, as did\nthen the Third Age.\n\n\nConsequences and Legacy\n\nThe War of the Ring had great influence on all of the lands of the\nnorthwest of Middle-earth. Most importantly it led to the restoration of\nthe Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor as the Reunited Kingdom, under King\nElessar Telcontar. The Steward of Gondor was dead, but he was succeeded\nby his son Faramir, who kept the office and was given the title _Prince\nof Ithilien_.\n\nIn Rohan the heir apparent, Théodred, was killed, and, during the Battle\nof Pelennor Fields, King Théoden died as well. He was succeeded by his\nnephew Éomer. In the Glittering Caves at the Hornburg, a Dwarven colony\nwas established, and Isengard was given to the Ents, who filled\nSaruman's pits and reforested the land, renaming it The Treegarth of\nOrthanc\n\nIn Dale, both King Brand and King Dáin II Ironfoot were killed, who were\nsucceeded by their sons Bard and Thorin III Stonehelm. They sent their\nemissaries to the crowning of Elessar, and were in alliance with Gondor\nuntil their Kingdoms ended.\n\nFor the Elves, the final decline had begun. With the destruction of the\nOne Ring, the power of the Three Rings faded, and the kingdoms that had\nbeen preserved by their magic began to fade with them. The bearers of\nthe Rings left Middle-earth, and Lórien was eventually abandoned. The\nElves of Lothlórien who did not depart over the Sea moved east to the\nsouthern third of Mirkwood, below the Narrows, which they named East\nLórien. In Eryn Lasgalen however, Thranduil's rule continued, and they\nhad peace. There was also an Elven colony in Ithilien. Many of the Elves\nof Rivendell departed over the Sea, and by Aragorn's death 120 years\nlater, it was entirely deserted.\n\nIn the Shire life continued as it had prior to the war. It was declared\na free land under the Sceptre of Annúminas, and Men were forbidden to\nenter it. The Westmarch was added to the Shire by King Elessar in SR\n1452.\n\nThe different races of Men that had served Sauron suffered grievously at\nthe hands of what appeared to be booty and loot just begging them to\ncome; much of Harad's army was annihilated on the Pelennor Fields,\nslaughtered by the swords of Gondor and the lances of Rohan. The mighty\nEasterlings hastily retreated back to their homelands after Sauron's\nfall and fought several territorial wars with King Elessar over lands\nnear the Sea of Rhûn, but ceased to be a threat altogether. While they\nwere still a menace, much like a sleeping viper, they never troubled the\nReunited Kingdom again.\n\nOnce the Fourth Age began, the elves stopped having an active influence\non the affairs of Middle-earth, having started fading away ever since\nthe Third Age. Orcs never became a serious threat again, reduced to\nsmall bands of mountain brigands they were never more than a nuisance.\nAll the Nazgûl were killed, with Sauron reduced to a mere shadow of\nmalice. Wars would still be fought by the Reunited Kingdom and Rohan\nagainst the Men that had allied with Sauron, the Haradrim and\nEasterlings.\n\n\nAdaptations\n\nMany adaptations of _The Lord of the Rings_ include part of the War in\nsome form or another.\n\nThere are several games that are patterned after the war: the Games\nWorkshop 2005 Summer Online Campaign, for _The Lord of the Rings\nStrategy Battle Game_; a board game published by Fantasy Flight Games\ncalled War of the Ring; a board and counter wargame called _War of the\nRings_ published by SPI in 1977 (which shows irrefutably strong\ninfluence over the Fantasy Flight version); The Lord of the Rings: War\nof the Ring, a real-time strategy computer game published by Sierra\nEntertainment in 2003; the _Battle for Middle-earth_ series of real-time\nstrategy games published by Electronic Arts in 2004 and 2006; and a\nboard and miniature wargame published by Nexus Editrice in 2004.\n\n_The War of the Ring_ is the title of the eighth volume of _The History\nof Middle-earth_. _The War of the Ring_ was the title J.

    "text": "The MISTY MOUNTAINS, also named the _HITHAEGLIR_ , was a mountain range that\nran 1280 kilometres (795.35 miles) from north to south between Eriador\nand the valley of the Great River, Anduin, and from Mount Gundabad in\nthe far north to Methedras in the south.\n\nAn early version of this range's name was _ERED HITHUI_ .\n\n\nGeographical description\n\n\n\nThe range's notable peaks were Caradhras, Celebdil, Fanuidhol, Mount\nGundabad, and Methedras.\n\nLocation\n\nThe northernmost peak of the Misty Mountains was Mount Gundabad; where\naccording to legend Durin (eldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves)\nawoke, though it became an abode and mountain-fortress of Orcs.\n\nThe greatest Dwarven realm in Middle-Earth, Khazad-dûm (later named\nMoria), was located at the midpoint of the Misty Mountains. The three\npeaks that were part of Khazad-dûm were Caradhras (Redhorn), Celebdil\n(Silvertine) and Fanuidhol (Cloudyhead). Inside Celebdil, the Dwarves\nbuilt the Endless Stair, from the foundations of the mountain to the top\nof it. The southernmost peak of the Misty Mountains was Methedras,\nmeaning “the Last Peak”.\n\nRoutes through the Misty Mountains\n\nThe most important passes were the High Pass and the Redhorn Pass. There\nwas also a pass at the source of the Gladden river.\n\nRoutes around the Misty Mountains\n\nThe Gap of Rohan was the valley (probably of the River Isen) between the\nsouthernmost peaks of the Misty Mountains and the northernmost of the\nWhite Mountains. There may have been a gap between Mount Gundabad in the\nMisty Mountains and the westernmost extremity of the Grey Mountains,\nthough published maps differ on this point. \n\nInhabitants\n\nUnder the Misty Mountains were the former Dwarf realm of Khazad-dum, and\nthe “Goblin-town” in which Bilbo Baggins stumbled across the One Ring,\nwhich had been in the possession of the creature Gollum, who also dwelt\nthere himself on the eastern side. Rivendell was hidden in the foothills\nof the Misty Mountains at the western end of the High Pass.\n\nCarn Dûm, where the Witch-King of Angmar resided for several centuries\nin the Third Age, lay between a western spur of the northern extreme of\nthe range, known as the Mountains of Angmar. Mount Gundabad, the largest\nGoblin dwelling in the Misty Mountains, was located south-east of\nAngmar.\n\nIsengard lay centered around the Tower of Orthanc in Nan Curunír, the\nvalley between the arms of Methedras, which was the southernmost peak of\nthe Misty Mountains. The “stone-giants” also inhabited this mountain\nrange, as told in _The Hobbit_.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Misty Mountains were created by Melkor during the Time of the Trees,\nwho wanted to make it difficult for Oromë, who often rode across\nMiddle-earth hunting his fell beasts, to pass.\n\nYears of the Trees\n\nThe Dwarves of Durin awoke under Mount Gundabad and later established\nthe caves of Khazad-dûm. Later, when the Elves on their Great Journey to\nValinor looked upon their terrible height a portion of the Teleri, later\nknown as the Nandor grew afraid and turned south down the Great River.\nThousands of years later, the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth and\nestablished great realms in the Beleriand and in the highlands, but they\nnever crossed the mountains or established realms within them.\n\nFirst and Second Ages\n\nOver three-hundred years into the First Age, the tribes of Men crossed\nthe Misty Mountains and began migrating into the Beleriand, first the\nEdain and then later the Easterlings or Swarthy Men. After the defeat of\nMorgoth, the surviving orcs and a Balrog came to live there and would\nremain a problem for over six-thousand years. The Easterling men who\nfought with Morgoth crossed the mountains and began living east of the\nWilderland in Rhûn. The Great Eagles also began living here in a place\nknown as the Eagles Eyrie.\n\nThe great Dwarven realm of Khazad-dûm beneath the Misty Mountains\nthrived as good relations with the Ñoldor of Eregion were established,\nuntil Sauron invaded Eriador from Mordor and the east destroying Eregion\nand ravaging the lands beyond. The dwarves survived by shutting\nthemselves in Khazad-dûm behind the Doors of Durin.\n\nThird Age\n\nIn TA 1980, the great Dwarven realm of Khazad-dûm came to an end when\nthe Dwarves unearthed a Balrog which led to its desertion by TA 1981,\nafter which it was known as Moria (literally, “black chasm”). Slowly,\nthe Misty Mountains became increasingly perilous and dangerous to\ntravelers as Goblins and other creatures came to dwell under there.\n\nAlmost a thousand years later, the thirteen Dwarves, Gandalf, and Bilbo\nBaggins used the High Pass to cross the Misty Mountains during the Quest\nfor the Lonely Mountain, and were captured by Goblins whilst crossing.\nUnder the mountains, the Great Goblin was slain, and Bilbo found the One\nRing.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring tried to cross the Redhorn Pass (after\nrejecting the High Pass leading to Rhovanion as being watched by the\nEnemy, and the Gap of Rohan as taking the Fellowship too close to\nIsengard), but a blizzard forced it to go under the mountain instead of\nover it. They faced a Balrog that dwelt in the deserted realm of\nKhazad-dûm. Gandalf slew the Balrog by casting it down from Zirakzigil,\nbut it had worn his life already, and on that high ground he lay until\nGwaihir bore him to Lothlorien.\n\n\nMentions in media and books\n\n-   Led Zeppelin recorded a song, _Misty Mountain Hop_, which seems to\n    have borrowed the name but little else from Tolkien. Several other\n    Led Zeppelin songs contain Tolkien references, including “The Battle\n    of Evermore” and “Ramble On”.\n-   Robert Jordan's fantasy series _The Wheel of Time_ also features a\n    mountain range called the _Mountains of Mist_.\n-   The Misty Montes on Titan, Saturn's largest moon, are named after\n    their Tolkienesque equivalent. This is from an IAU convention that\n    names mountain ranges on Titan after mountain ranges from Tolkien's\n    work."

    "title": "Arda",
    "page_id": "238",
    "text": "ARDA (Quenya; IPA: ), also known as EARTH, was the world in which all\npeoples of Middle-earth lived.\n\n\nHistory\n\nArda consisted of land masses, chiefly the continents of Middle-earth\nand Aman, oceans and seas, and an atmosphere. It was a part of Eä, the\ncreated World (i.e., of the whole Tolkienian star system). Arda was\ncreated, together with the rest of Eä, through the Music of the Ainur,\nand was set apart as a dwelling place for the Children of Ilúvatar (that\nis, Elves and Men). When Eä was created, many of the Ainur chose to\ndwell within it as long as it should last, and they built Arda and chose\nto reside there. The most powerful of these Ainur were called the Valar,\nthe Powers of the World.\n\nOriginally, Arda was flat, rather than spherical (though it still had\nmountains and valleys), and the Valar built it to a symmetric plan. They\nlit up Arda with great lamps, and the explosion of biological life that\nensued became known as the First Spring. This period ended when Melkor\nlaunched a surprise attack, destroying not only the lamps but the layout\nof the world.\n\nAfter this time, Arda was surrounded by a mighty , Ekkaia or the\nEncircling Sea, and the continents were separated from each other by\nBelegaer, called the Great Sea. During the Years of the Trees, Valinor,\nthe realm of the Valar occupying most of the continent of Aman, was lit\nup by the Two Trees. Middle-earth was dark. At first it was largely\ncontrolled by Melkor and his servants, but when the Elves awoke the\nValar went to war against Melkor, defeating him and imprisoning him in\nthe Halls of Mandos for “three ages”. During this war, many of the\nwesternmost areas of Middle-earth were drowned beneath the waves.\n\nDuring the captivity of Melkor, the Valar invited the Elves to dwell\nwith them in Aman. Many Elves accepted this invitation, and set out for\nthe West; these became known as the Eldar. Along the way, some groups of\nEldar, notably the Nandor and the Sindar, chose to remain in\nMiddle-earth. The Sindar settled in the region of Beleriand, a\nnorth-western coastal area of Middle-earth.\n\nWhen the Years of the Sun began, Arda experienced the so-called Second\nSpring, a new period of growth and vitality as a result of the light of\nthe sun in Middle-earth. At that time, Men also awoke in the east of\nMiddle-earth.\n\nAt the end of the First Age, Beleriand was destroyed during the War of\nWrath, and much of it sank beneath Belegaer; only a few high points,\nsuch as Himring (later Himling) and parts of Dorthonion (later Tol\nFuin), remained above sea level as islands.\n\nIn the Second Age, Númenor was raised in the Great Sea for the Edain.\nThis island existed through most of the Second Age, but was destroyed as\na result of the pride of the Númenórean people in defying the Ban of the\nValar and sailing to Aman in the west.\n\nDuring the downfall of Númenor, Arda was made round. The Undying Lands\n(Aman and Tol Eressëa) were taken out of the world, and could only be\nreached by the Elves, following the _straight road_ that was granted to\nthem. As Aman was taken away from Arda, new lands and continents were\ncreated.\n\nSouth of Middle-earth was the Dark Land and east of it was the Land of\nthe Sun.\n\nTolkien stated many times that Arda was our world in a fictional time,\nso we can interpret the known regions of Middle-earth as Europe. Tolkien\nstated that The Shire was situated at roughly the same latitude as the\nMidlands of England, while Minas Tirith in Gondor was at the same\nlatitude of , putting Mount Doom and Mordor in the general region of .\nHowever, the entire continent of Middle-earth extends beyond the regions\nknown to Gondor, far into the uncharted East and South, and Middle-earth\nprobably encompassed all of what later became . Information regarding\nboth was very vague. To the south were the Hither Lands including Harad,\nthough “Harad” means “South” and while properly used for the region\nimmediately south of Gondor. Near Harad and Far Harad probably\ncorresponded to North Africa and sub-Saharan , respectively. There were\nmany stretches of sun-scorched desert in Near Harad, but like Africa\nthere was supposedly a jungle beyond it which few had ever ventured to,\nfrom which the great Oliphaunts were found. Tolkien also said that the\nHaradrim loosely corresponded to the (though “Haradrim” refers to a\ngroup of many races, not just the one). Men of Far Harad are also\ndescribed as being black skinned. The vast eastern lands were\ncollectively referred to as Rhûn, and like Harad they are uncharted. The\nEasterlings, like the Haradrim, were a diverse collection of many races,\nranging from nomadic steppe horsemen akin to Turkish and Mongol tribes,\nto civilized and rich kingdoms stretching across the vast Eastlands.\nRhûn supposedly stopped at another ocean at its eastern end. In ancient\ntimes the great chain of the Red Mountains, the eastern counterpart of\nthe Blue Mountains of the west, ran north to south near here (all of the\nworld was once symmetrical at the dawn of time). The Elves first awoke\nin the east, though their original home of Cuiviénen doubtless no longer\nexisted by the Third Age. It is not known if the Red Mountains\nthemselves survived into the Third Age, either intact or in some reduced\nform (like the Blue Mountains). The lands of the east probably\ncollectively corresponded to the Asian continent, if Harad was taken as\nAfrica. It is said that the Blue Wizards went far into the east of Rhûn\nand beyond to stir up rebellions against Sauron in the lands he held\nsway over, though the tales of these struggles never reached the west in\ndetail. It is also said that the Blue Wizards somehow failed in their\nmission; this is interpreted several ways, either that like Saruman they\nset themselves up as lords of men, or that like Radagast they started to\ncare more for the local people they were charged with protecting than\nMiddle-earth as a whole and then refused to return. Tolkien did state\nthat many of the “magic cults” and orders that exist in Asian countries\ntoday can trace their origins back to the Blue Wizards teaching local\npeoples of the east the magical arts.\n\nThere was also a separate continent south and east of Middle-earth\ncalled the Dark Land, which could correspond to . Another separate\ncontinent to the east of Middle-earth was the Land of the Sun, so called\nbecause when the world was flat the Gates of the Sun were near there,\nand it would be scorched. After the Fall of Númenor, Arda is made round\nand new lands are created east of Middle-earth (and west too, now that\nthe world is round and can be circumnavigated), out of these Sun Lands\nthat are apparently meant to be North and South , though none of\nTolkien's mythology deals with what happens there. The Sun Lands were\nknown to contain a north to south running mountain range which could\ncorrespond to the Rockies and Andes mountain ranges.\n\n\nArda Unmarred\n\nThe original world as built by the Valar was referred to as ARDA\nUNMARRED. This world was effectively destroyed by the wars of the Valar\nand Melkor, and only Valinor still resembled it in part. Arda Unmarred\nwas a symmetrical world with everlasting light.\n\n\nArda Marred\n\nARDA MARRED was the name given to the world as it is: the world after\nthe wars of the Valar and Melkor, and the dispersing of Melkor's Fëa and\nhröa throughout the world. It is this world from which are formed the\nFëa and hröa of the Children of Ilúvatar, and therefore it is at times a\ncruel and evil world with plagues, extreme colds, heat, and other\nconcepts which do not exist in Arda Unmarred.\n\nArda Marred also broke the design of Elvish immortality: in Arda Marred\nElves slowly fade, until at last they are little more than wraiths. Only\nin Valinor was this fading delayed, which is one reason all Elves have\nno choice but to sail to Valinor in the end. One of the special\nabilities of the Rings of Power was that they could delay the effects of\ntime, and as such were used by Elrond and Galadriel to preserve their\nrealms. After the destruction of the One Ring in the Fourth Age, the\nElvish rings' power over time was also lost, so the last of the Eldar\nhad no choice but to leave Middle Earth and sail west for Valinor.\n\n\nArda Healed\n\nARDA HEALED is the prophecy that Arda Marred will be restored: it will\nbe like Arda Unmarred but better, since it will also incorporate all the\ngood things of Arda Marred. Arda Healed will be created after the Dagor\nDagorath, when Morgoth will finally be destroyed, and the world broken.\nAfterwards, a new world will be created and will be known as Arda\nHealed.\n\nGaladriel's words while parting with Treebeard at Isengard in The Return\nof the King are “Not in Middle-earth, nor until the lands that lie under\nthe wave are lifted up again. Then in the willow-meads of Tasarinan we\nmay meet in the spring. Farewell!”. This might imply that Beleriand will\nbe recovered after the Dagor Dagorath. It is however unknown, since Arda\nHealed will contain all the good things of Arda Marred, whether Númenor\nwill also be recovered or not.\n\n    _See also: Timeline of Arda, Realms of Arda_\n\n\nRound World version\n\nIn the late Round World version of _The Silmarillion_ (see: The History\nof Middle-earth), ARDA was the name of the entire , while the name for\nthe earth was AMBAR or IMBAR."

    "page_id": "240",
    "text": "MINAS TIRITH  (IPA:\n) was the capital of Gondor in the Third Age and the Fourth Age of\nMiddle-earth. Originally known as MINAS ANOR, the “Tower of the Setting\nSun”, it replaced the city Osgiliath as the new capital and stockade of\nGondor.\n\nWhen the Enemy began to take shape again, Minas Anor was renamed Minas\nTirith, the “Tower of Guard.” The city was also called THE WHITE CITY,\nas the courtyard in the front of the city's Citadel contained the White\nTree. Many important events took place in and in front of the city, such\nas the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the healing of Éowyn by Aragorn\nafter the battle, and the coronation of Aragorn II Elessar.\n\n\nLayout\n\nMinas Tirith was surrounded by the Rammas Echor, a large ringwall\nencircling the city and the Pelennor Fields. This wall was built after\nMinas Ithil fell and was renamed Minas Morgul. It was repaired by\nEcthelion II during the time of the War of the Ring, but it had not the\nstrength to defend the city from the Dark Lord Sauron's legions of\nUruk-hai from Mordor. The city itself lay on a hill beneath Mount\nMindolluin, which rose above the city's citadel, by a length of a couple\nof thousand feet. Mount Mindolluin was where Aragorn found the seedling\nof the White Tree. \n\nThe city was divided into seven one-hundred-foot high levels, each\nsurrounded by white walls, except the first walls which had the same\nkind of black stone as Orthanc as a face. The gates connecting the\nlevels did not lay behind one another in a line, but faced in different\ndirections. A spur of rock, whose summit was level with the city's\nuppermost tier, jutted out from the front of the city in an easterly\ndirection, dividing all but the first level into two. Each level was\nscattered with many alleys, narrow passageways, and full-fledged houses\n(which were probably quite rare in the city). On the sixth level were\nlocated the Houses of Healing, surrounded by pleasant gardens. Finally,\nwithin the seventh wall, was the Citadel of Minas Tirith, with the White\nTower of Ecthelion - three hundred feet high, so that its apex was one\nthousand feet above the plain.\n\nLevels\n\n\n\nThe First Level of Minas Tirith was the lowest level of Minas Tirith\nwhere was the Main gate.\n\nDuring the Siege of Minas Tirith, Uruk-hai cast fire into the First\nLevel, burning many buildings and causing general havoc to many of the\ndefenders. Later on, the Main Gate was breached when Grond was finally\nused against it, and the soldiers of Gondor and Uruk-hai clashed in the\nstreets of the First Circle but Aragorn ordered a retreat and then made\ntheir way up.\n\n\nHistory\n\nMinas Tirith (as Minas Anor) was built in SA 3320. King Ostoher rebuilt\nthe city in TA 420, and, gradually, it became more important than\nOsgiliath, the original capital, which in later years fell into ruin.\nKing Tarondor finally moved the King's House to the city in TA 1640,\nthereby making it the official capital of the kingdom of Gondor. In the\nyear TA 2002, the White City's companion tower Minas Ithil (the “Tower\nof the Moon”) on the borders of Mordor was captured by the Ringwraiths\nand renamed Minas Morgul (the “Tower of Sorcery”). Minas Anor was then\nrenamed Minas Tirith, meaning the “Tower of Guard”, to indicate that,\nsince the fall of Minas Ithil, Minas Tirith was the only thing that\ndefended Gondor and all the other lands around and behind it against the\ndarkness from Mordor. The Rammas Echor, the great wall encircling the\nrich farmlands and suburbs of the City, was built at this time.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nMinas Tirith only has Gondorian soldiers while the civilians dwell in\nOsgiliath with several Gondorian soldiers. After the Uruk-hai attacked\nand overran Osgiliath a thousand soldiers were killed while the\nremaining thousand soldiers fled to Minas Tirith while the civilians\nwere evacuated to Rohan. The remaining gondorian soldiers entered\nOsgiliath and once the uruk-hai were slain the civilians departed from\nRohan and returned to Osgiliath.\n\nSiege of Minas Tirith\n\nMinas Tirith was besieged by the armies of Mordor, under the Great\nDarkness generated by Sauron's power. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields\ntook place on March 15, 3019 in the fields surrounding the city. It was\na very large battle. Theoden, the King of Rohan was killed during this\nbattle by the Witch-king of Angmar. At about the same time, the\nWitch-king was destroyed by Éowyn, lady of Rohan, who was severely\nwounded in the process. It was also there that Gandalf took command of\nthe City's defenses from the Ruling Steward Denethor after he fell to\ndespair. Aragorn later arrived at the hour of need with Gondor's Army of\nthe South which he had liberated from defending the port city of\nPelargir, turning the tide of battle in favor of the Free Peoples. After\nthe battle, the stench of death was heavy in Minas Tirith's air, and the\nPelennor Fields lay strewn with bodies.\n\nFourth Age\n\nOn 1 May 3019, the Crowning of King Elessar took place on the plain\noutside Minas Tirith. After his coronation, he entered the city as the\nKing of Gondor, as he was destined to become from the start of his\nlifetime. With his coronation, King Elessar refounded the line of the\nKings of Gondor, and as he was also the King of the Kingdom of Arnor,\nMinas Tirith became Capital of the Reunited Kingdom.\n\nMinas Tirith was repaired by its new king (who grew plants inside of its\nwalls to add to its luster and beauty) and by the Dwarves of Glittering\nCaves, particularly Gimli, who built a new gate for the city (made of\nmithril and steel) and altogether fixed the layout of the city as well.\nMinas Tirith was said to have been made even more beautiful than when it\nwas at the time of its founding. The city is known to have stood firm\nand strong well into the Fourth Age because of these two renovations.\n\nIn _The Silmarillion_, as Of The Ring Of Power And The Third Age says,\nafter War of the Ring, the city is referred to as Minas Anor again after\nthe overthrow of Sauron and the destruction of Barad-dûr.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nMinas Tirith appears briefly in Peter Jackson's first movie _The Lord of\nthe Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring_, where Gandalf learns about the\nOne Ring; as well as his second film _The Lord of the Rings: The Two\nTowers_ where it is seen as a glimpse in the distance when the rangers\nof Ithilien hold Frodo and Sam captive. It is a central and major\nlocation in Peter Jackson's third movie _The Lord of the Rings: The\nReturn of the King_.\n\nTolkien's description of the physical layout of Minas Tirith is largely\nfollowed in Peter Jackson's movie. The films crew built a model of Minas\nTirith closely based on Tolkien's description, although there are a few\nof assumptions made by the director and differences from the book. One\nof these is the assumption that the top of the courtyard of the White\nTree was flattened and paved. Another difference between the movie and\nthe book is that in the book the coronation of Aragorn takes place not\nin the courtyard atop the city but outside the city, and only after his\ncoronation does Aragorn march into the city as the new King of Gondor.\n\nDespite the book's describing the first wall as dark in colour (similar\nto Orthanc), unusually high and almost indestructible, in the movies it\nis not only white and several times lower than the rest of the walls,\nit's also heavily damaged because of attacks. The film also shows the\nold White Tree with blossom at the arrival of Aragorn, though in the\nbook Gandalf and Aragorn discover a new sapling on the slopes of Mount\nMindolluin and replant it in the place of the old tree.\n\nThe Great Gate of Minas Tirith in the films was flanked by towers and\nbastions made from the white (though black in the book) almost\nindestructible stone (similar to that of Orthanc) which makes up the\nentire lower level. The Gate was replaced by one that was made in the\nLonely Mountain. In addition there is a wall surrounding Pelennor fields\ncalled Rammas Echor which was breached during the siege of Gondor."

    "title": "Lindon",
    "page_id": "248",
    "text": "LINDON was a Elven Kingdom founded by Gil-galad at the beginning of the\nSecond Age. It was the longest-standing Eldarin Kingdom in the history\nof Middle-earth, and the mightiest throughout the Second Age. It was\nruled by its founder, Gil-galad, the High King of the Ñoldor, who,\nduring that age, was the strongest and most powerful enemy of Sauron in\nMiddle-earth.\n\nThe realm endured through the Third Age, though diminished, and was the\nsite of the Grey Havens, where the Elves, as well as the Ring-bearers,\nsailed to the Undying Lands.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nLindon was located in what remained of Ossiriand; the Land of Seven\nRivers and all that was left of the peninsula of Beleriand after the War\nof Wrath. The mountains, partially sunk in the ruin of Beleriand,\nformed a portion of the realm's east border. The realm reached as far\nnorth over the mountains as the Little Lune. North of that boundary was\nwhat remained of the Dwarf kingdom of Belegost. After the ruin of\nBeleriand, Gil-Galad founded the realm of Lindon, which encompassed all\nthe land west of the Blue Mountains and east of the sea in the North of\nMiddle-earth. The Gulf of Lune broke the realm of Lindon into Forlindon\nand Harlindon. The Grey Havens lay at the mouth of the river Lune.\nThrough a break in the Blue Mountains, the land of Eriador lay to the\neast, and farther southeast laid the Shire. Eastward also lay the\nKingdom of Eregion, at the feet of the Misty Mountains, which was also\nruled by Gil-Galad under the lordship of Celebrimbor. Towards the\nend of the Second Age, the realm of Arnor was established by Elendil to\nthe northeast of Lindon.\n\nThe lands of Lindon were said to be lush and green, with thick forests\nlining the foothills of the Blue Mountains. The havens of the elves were\nfound along the Gulf of Lune, where the land became rocky yet lush along\nthe coast. Tolkien stated that Lindon was Elven country “where no Man\ndwells”. It was the last realm that was fair and free. It also had a\nmildly tempered climate, with mild winters and mild summers.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the Second Age\n\n_Lindon_ was another name for the Ossiriand in East Beleriand, where the\nLaiquendi dwelt.\n\nSecond Age\n\nAfter the War of Wrath, those Elves who had sought refuge on the coast\nof the sea at the mouths of the river Sirion removed into the land that\nwas left in the northwest of Middle-earth. They, led by Gil-Galad,\nestablished the realm of Lindon in SA 1. In the North at Forlindon\nGil-galad ruled a majority of Noldorin Elves. In southern Harlindon,\nCeleborn ruled a fiefdom of many Sindar and the remaining Green Elves of\nBeleriand under Gil-Galad. He did not rule under Gil-galad for long,\nthough, eventually removing to the shores of Lake Nenuial with his wife,\nGaladriel. At the Grey Havens Círdan was the lord of many shipbuilders\nof the Teleri who survived the ruin of the First Age. The Elves believed\nnow that the threat of Morgoth was removed, and Lindon became a fair\nkingdom. Gil-galad and the Elves of Lindon had a very strong friendship\nwith Númenor and its kings before the Darkening of Númenor.\n\nEarly in the sixth century of the Second Age, the first ships of Númenor\nreturned to Middle-earth. Vëantur, father-in-law of Tar-Meneldur, led\nthe first expedition. Later he returned with his grandson and heir to\nthe throne, Aldarion, and the Númenoreans were well liked by Gil-galad\nand his people. Tar-Aldarion continued his voyages to Lindon throughout\nhis reign as the sixth King of Númenor, and Gil-galad and Círdan taught\nmuch to the mariners of Númenor. Gil-galad befriended Aldarion and gave\nhim and his father, Tar-Meneldur, many gifts. After the reign of\nAldarion, Númenor was less active in the affairs of Lindon for many\nhundred years, though friendship remained.\n\nIn the twelfth century, Sauron attempted to infiltrate Lindon disguised\nas 'Annatar', the Lord of Gifts. His strength now on the mend after\nMorgoth's defeat, Sauron purposed to corrupt the strongest of all the\nremaining Elf-kingdoms. Gil-galad denied him, and so did Elrond, who\ndwelt then with the King in Forlindon. Though they did not know\nAnnatar's true identity at the time, the wise king of Lindon foresaw\nevil in Annatar. Sauron then turned his attention to Eregion, where he\nsucceeded in befriending the Noldorin smiths under Celebrimbor who\nworked there.\n\n\n\nAfter Sauron forged the One Ring at the beginning of the sixth century,\nhe declared war on the Elf-kingdoms to capture the Rings of Power they\nhad hidden from him. Gil-galad sent a small army led by Elrond east to\nthe aid of Eregion. There he joined with Celeborn, but Sauron's forces\ndefeated the combined force. His army ravaged Eregion and the rest of\nEriador, and came to the borders of Lindon. There, Gil-galad's forces\ndug in against the forces of Sauron, and were strengthened by a great\nfleet sent from Númenor by Tar-Minastir, the King of Númenor, under his\nson and heir Ciryatan. With the aid of the Númenoreans, participating in\ntheir first war upon Middle-Earth, Lindon was freed and Sauron's forces\noverthrown. Sauron returned to Mordor and focused his attention now on\nruining Númenor.\n\nIn the year SA 3319 of the Second Age, Númenor was destroyed, and\nElendil and sons and his remnant of Faithful Númenoreans landed on the\ncoast of Middle-earth. Elendil established the Realms in Exile which\nwere the North-Kingdom of Arnor and the South-Kingdom of Gondor. He\nbecame close friends and ally with Gil-galad, and they pledged support\nto one another against the preparing blow of Sauron, who had risen to\npower once again after fleeing the ruin of Númenor.\n\nThe War of the Last Alliance began in SA 3434, and the Elves of Lindon\nformed a large part of the backbone of the Elven armies. Elendil's\nNúmenorean refugees, along with Dúnedain who had removed to Middle-Earth\nbefore the destruction of Númenor, marched alongside the host of\nGil-galad, and eventually they laid siege to the Dark Tower. Sauron\nhimself then came to battle, and fought Gil-galad and Elendil. The two\nkings defeated him but died in the process. Then, Isildur son of Elendil\ncut the ring from Sauron's hand, and he was for a time defeated.\n\nThird Age\n\nAfter the death of Gil-galad, the lordship of Lindon passed to Círdan;\nand the line of Noldorin kings in Middle-Earth came to an end. The\npopulation of Lindon had been reduced by the long and bloody war with\nSauron. With the loss of their king, many of the Noldor and Sindar left\nfor Valinor. Following the war, many Elves began to come to the Grey\nHavens and sail to Valinor, further depleting Lindon's population.\nCírdan continued his shipbuilding, and had much work constructing the\nvessels to carry the Elves west. However, the kingdom began to dwindle\nas the ships continued to sail.\n\nThe Witch-king of Angmar attacked the Kingdom of Arnor in the thirteenth\ncentury of the Third Age. Lindon lent what aid it could to the Dúnedain,\nbut after many years, the North-Kingdom was overthrown. The Dúnedain\nwent into exile, and the kingdom of Lindon shrank rapidly into a safe\nhaven for the Elves of Middle-earth. By the time of the War of the Ring,\nit was a shadow of its former glory, with only Grey Havens seeing\nregular traffic and activity. After Sauron's defeat, the last Elves\nbegan to sail for Valinor, and Círdan remained there well into the\nFourth Age, awaiting the last ship to sail west himself.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _LINDON_ means “Land of the Singers”, from the Quenya term\n_lin_ or _lind_ (“to sing, make musical sound”) and _-on_, which\nis a common suffix for regions."

    "text": "The ÑOLDOR (Quenya; IPA: or in Third Age Middle-earth ; meaning _those\nwith knowledge_; adjectival ÑOLDORIN; or TA ) were the second clan of\nthe Elves. According to legend, the clan was originally known as the\nTATYAR (; meaning _second ones_; adjectival TATYARIN; ) and was founded\nby Tata, the second elf to awake at Cuiviénen, his spouse Tatië, and\ntheir 54 companions - but it was Finwë, the first ÑOLDO to come to\nValinor with Oromë, who became their king and led most of them to\nValinor. The Ñoldor who come to Aman spoke Quenya, or more specifically\nthe widely-known Ñoldorin dialect of it. However, fully half the Tatyar\nrefused the call of the Valar, and became counted among the Avari.\n\nThey were also known as NOLDOLI,''' ''' _Deep Elves_, _Golodhrim_,\n_Aulendur_ ('Servant of Aulë' ) and _Golug_. The singular form of the\nnoun is _Ñoldo_ and the adjective is _Ñoldorin_. They were the Second\nClan of the Elves in both order and size, the other clans being the\nVanyar and the Teleri. They typically had dark hair (except for those\nwho had Vanyarin blood, most prominently the members of the House of\nFinarfin).\n\nThe Ñoldor are accounted as the greatest of the Elves in lore and\nsmithcraft. Fëanor (son of Finwë by Míriel) was the greatest of their\ncraftsmen, and their second and briefest-reigning High King. When Melkor\nkilled Finwë and stole the Silmarils, Fëanor renamed Melkor: _Morgoth_\n(“Black Enemy”), and persuaded the Ñoldor to pursue him to Middle-earth\nand wage war against him.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nIn Valinor, the Ñoldorin Elves were ruled by the High King Finwë. The\nÑoldor became the friends and students of Aulë, due to their love of\ncraft and the knowledge Aulë imparted to them. Then Finwë's wife Miriel\ngave birth to her only son, Fëanor, and was spent in mind and spirit.\nMiriel's spirit passed to the Halls of Mandos, depriving Finwë of joy in\nValinor. But Fëanor proved to be a mighty Elf Lord; subtle in speech,\nand the most skilled craftsmen of the Ñoldor. When he was come to his\nprime, Fëanor wrought the Silmarils, the great jewels that contained the\nlight of the Two Trees. But he was prideful and arrogant, and did not\ntake kindly to his father's second marriage to Indis of the Vanyar. From\nher Finwë fathered two more children who would found their own houses;\nFingolfin and Finarfin. This was the first cause of disunion in the\nHouse of Finwë, as Fëanor had little love for his half siblings.\n\nWhen Melkor was released from captivity, he sought to exploit that\ndisunion in a bid to gain the Silmarils and estrange the Ñoldor from the\nValar. He spread lies amongst the Ñoldor, claiming that the Valar were\nkeeping them in Aman so they would not be able to rule the lands of\nMiddle-earth, and that Fingolfin and Fëanor were plotting against each\nother. When Fëanor drew sword against Fingolfin, the Valar intervened\nand banished Fëanor from Valmar to the mountain fortress of Formenos.\nThe Ñoldor grew restless as they began to hunger for the unguarded lands\nof Middle-earth.\n\nBut worse was to come. When Melkor destroyed the Two Trees of Valinor\nand slew Finwe, he also stole the Silmarils and fled to Middle-earth. An\nenraged Fëanor then spoke before all of the Ñoldor and gave an\nimpassioned speech. He urged them to leave the land of the Valar and\ntake up kingdoms in Middle-earth, where they could rule as they wished.\nMany of the royal line, including Galadriel, wished indeed to see\nMiddle-earth and rule their own fair kingdoms. Fëanor then swore a\nterrible Oath to reclaim the Silmarils, with the promise of retribution\nfor any who should withhold them. The Ñoldorin Host gathered, though the\ngreater part followed Fingolfin, trusting his wisdom over Fëanor's\narrogance.\n\nBefore the First Age the Ñoldor led by Fëanor went north and demanded\nthat the Falmari let them use their ships. When the Falmari refused,\nFëanor and his host destroyed the port of Alqualondë, which had been\nbuilt by the Teleri, committing the first Kinslaying. Fëanor's host then\ntook possession of the ships. Not long afterwards, the Ñoldor were\nconfronted by Mandos, the Doomsman of the Valar. Mandos delivered the\nProphecy of the North, pronouncing doom on the Ñoldor for the Kinslaying\nand warning that if they continued they would not recover the Silmarils\nand moreover that there would be great grief in the tragedy that would\nbefall them. At this, some of the Ñoldor who had no hand in the\nKinslaying, including Finarfin son of Finwë by Indis, returned to\nValinor, and the Valar forgave them. Other Ñoldor led by Fingolfin son\nof Finwë by Indis (some of whom were blameless in the Kinslaying)\nremained determined to leave Valinor for Middle-earth. Prominent among\nthese others was Finarfin's daughter, Galadriel.\n\nFëanor and his host crossed the sea to Middle-earth leaving those led by\nFingolfin, his half-brother, behind. Upon his arrival in Middle-earth,\nFëanor had the ships burned. When Fingolfin and his host discovered\ntheir betrayal, they went farther north and crossed the sea by means of\nthe Helcaraxë. Many of them died while crossing the paths of the\nHelcaraxë and the cruel hills of ice, including Turgon's wife Elenwë.\nThe departure of the Ñoldor out of the Undying Lands marked the\nbeginning of the First Age, and the years of the Sun. At last, the Host\nof Fingolfin arrived in Middle-earth, and their journey through the\nHelcaraxë was one of the greatest deeds of renown. Few deeds of the\nÑoldor would ever surpass this, but the bitterness of the crossing had\nkindled fresh hatred for the House of Fëanor.\n\nFëanor's company was soon attacked by Morgoth. When Fëanor rode too far\nfrom his retinue during the Dagor-nuin-Giliath (year 1 of the First Age)\nhe was slain by Gothmog and the other Balrogs.\n\nBecause Fëanor had taken the ships and left the remaining Ñoldor in\nAman, the royal houses of the Ñoldor were feuding. But recently\nMaedhros, eldest son of Feanor, had been captured by Morgoth. Fingon,\nson of Fingolfin, who remembered great friendship between himself and\nMaedhros, rescued him from the slopes of Thangorodrim. For this deed the\nÑoldor rejoiced and their feud was ended. By right Maedhros had\nsucceeded Fëanor as King, but in gratitude he renounced the Kingship to\nhis uncle Fingolfin, who became the third High King of the Ñoldor. His\nbrothers did not agree to this, and began to refer to themselves as the\nDisplaced, because the High Kingship had passed them by. Nevertheless,\nthe princes of the Ñoldor established great realms in Beleriand, and to\nmany it seemed the words of Feanor were justified. Here the Ñoldor were\nmighty and lordly, rather than at the bottom of the hierarchy in\nValinor. And for a while there was peace between the Houses of Fingolfin\nand Fëanor. But the House of Fëanor was still bound by the Oath, which\nin turn was tied to the Curse of Mandos.\n\nFingolfin reigned long in the land of Hithlum, and his younger son\nTurgon built the hidden kingdom Gondolin. Fingolfin's reign was marked\nby warfare against Morgoth and in the year 75 of the First Age the\nÑoldor started the Siege of Angband, the great fortress of Morgoth. But\nin the year FA 455 the siege was broken by Morgoth (in the Dagor\nBragollach), and Fingolfin perceived that the war against Morgoth was\nutterly futile. In his fury, Fingolfin rode to Angband and challenged\nMorgoth to single combat. Reluctantly, Morgoth came forth to duel him.\nFingolfin dealt Morgoth seven wounds from which he never healed, but at\nlast Fingolfin was slain. Thorondor, Lord of Eagles, scratched Morgoth's\nface and took Fingolfin's body. His eldest son Fingon succeeded him as\nHigh King of the Ñoldor.\n\nIn the year 471, Maedhros organized an all-out attack on Morgoth and\nthis led to the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. The battle was a great disaster for\nthe Ñoldor, and Fingon the Valiant was slain. He was succeeded by his\nbrother Turgon, but Fingon's son Gil-galad was sent to the Havens.\n\nTurgon had withdrawn to Gondolin and tried to keep the kingdom hidden\nfrom Morgoth. He was so successful that even most of the Ñoldor didn't\nknow where it was located, and he was High King in name alone. In FA\n510, Gondolin was betrayed by Maeglin and sacked. During the attack\nTurgon was killed; however many of his people escaped and found their\nway south. As Turgon had no sons, the Kingship passed back to Fingon's\nson Gil-galad, becoming the sixth and last High King of the Ñoldor.\n\nFinally, the Valar came down to Middle-earth and in the year 583 the War\nof Wrath was fought and Morgoth was cast into the Void. However,\nBeleriand sank into the sea, except for a part of Ossiriand which became\nLindon, and a few isles. The defeat of Morgoth marked the beginning of\nthe Second Age. The Ñoldor were once again summoned to Valinor and the\nCurse of Mandos was laid to rest. Some departed because they had grown\nweary of grief, but many refused to leave the lands they had laboured in\nfor so long. Moreover others refused out of pride, unwilling to\nrelinquish their high status in Middle-earth. The last of the great\nleaders was Galadriel, who stayed due to her pride, reasoning that her\nfamily had never done any wrong and that she was mightier in\nMiddle-earth.\n\n\n\nGil-galad founded a new kingdom at Lindon, and ruled throughout the\nSecond Age, longer than any of the High Kings except for Finwë. He was\nalso accepted as High King by the Ñoldor of Eregion. But at the end of\nthe Second Age his allies in Númenor lost their island and Elendil,\nIsildur and Anárion came to Middle-earth and they founded the kingdoms\nof Arnor and Gondor.\n\nDespite their prosperity and power, the Ñoldor were not at peace. While\nthey had refused Valinor in favour of retaining their lordship in the\nlands of Middle-earth, they still desired the bliss that Valinor\npromised. It was the doom of Elves that, though immortal, in the land of\nmortals they felt the weariness of time and change. This weariness only\ngrew as the years went by. In Valinor the lands were hallowed and\nenchanted, allowing the Elves to live in eternal bliss, but in mortal\nlands there was no such power to sustain them.\n\nIt was at this time that Annatar, Lord of Gifts, came forth with the\noffer of the very bliss that the Elves desired. Gil-galad, Galadriel and\nElrond distrusted this mysterious figure and shunned him. But in\nEregion, Annatar's teachings were held in awe by the Ñoldor Elves and\nthey received him gladly. Their leader was Celebrimbor, the grandson of\nFeanor himself, and he had inherited much of his grandfather's\nskill. Such was Annatar's knowledge that he was believed to be an\nemissary of Aulë, as he first proclaimed. Annatar taught Celebrimbor the\nart of crafting Rings of Power. In secret Celebrimbor forged the three\ngreatest rings; Narya, Nenya, and Vilya. These rings were imbued with a\nspiritual power that could protect and preserve all things unstained,\nwarding off the effects of time. Thus the desire of the Elves was\nfulfilled in the making of these rings. The three were secretly\ndistributed to some of the High Elf Lords. Galadriel received Nenya,\nGil-galad received Vilya and Narya was given to Círdan. But they were\ndeceived, for Annatar had crafted the rings for a different purpose; to\nbind all the bearers together as slaves. Annatar was actually Sauron in\ndisguise, and he treacherously forged a ruling ring to govern all the\nother rings and their respective bearers. However, when Sauron placed\nthe One Ring on his finger, the Elves suddenly became aware of him due\nto the powerful connection between the rings. They heard Sauron speak\nthe dreaded words of doom, and the Elves understood that he would be\nmaster of their own minds. The Elves narrowly avoided this trap and took\noff their rings. Gil-galad gave Vilya to Elrond for safekeeping, and to\nuse it if Gil-galad should fall.\n\nEnraged, Sauron declared war, demanding all the rings were his by right\nas they were made from his craft. Eregion was attacked and destroyed,\nand Celebrimbor perished. Before his death Sauron interrogated him as to\nthe whereabouts of the Three Rings he had forged alone, but Celebrimbor\nwithheld the truth and died from torture. Thus the knowledge of the\ncraft perished with him also.\n\nBy this time Sauron had replaced his master Morgoth as the Dark Lord. He\nhad deceived the Númenóreans and managed to return from Númenor to his\nrefuge in Mordor. But in his absence he had overlooked the growing power\nof Gil-galad. Sauron hated both the Númenóreans and the Ñoldor, and\ntried to destroy Gondor before it could take root, but Gil-galad's\nforces thwarted him. Then Elendil and Gil-galad took counsel and formed\nthe Last of Alliance of Elves and Men, a mighty host of Noldor and\nNumenoreans.\n\nThe host set out for Mordor and defeated Sauron's forces in the Battle\nof Dagorlad and finally in the Siege of Barad-dûr. There Gil-galad\nproved mighty enough to duel with Sauron himself, and with Elendil's\nhelp they inflicted enough wounds on Sauron that the Dark Lord's mortal\nform was destroyed. But Gil-galad was burned to death by the heat of\nSauron's hand, and so ended the High Kingship of the Ñoldor. No new High\nKing was elected, as Gil-galad left no heir and no one else had a strong\nenough claim. For this reason, the High Kingship of the Ñoldor was said\nto have passed overseas, to the Ñoldor of Valinor, ruled by Finarfin,\nthe third son of Finwë who had never left. Because Tuor had been adopted\nby Turgon as a son, and had married his daughter Idril, Tuor's mortal\ndescendants claimed the title High King: therefore, Elros became first\nHigh King of Númenor, signifying this with the prefix Tar- (and later in\nAdûnaic Ar-). After the Downfall of Númenor, Elendil and his heirs of\nthe older, northern line named themselves High Kings of Arnor, later\nsignifying this with the royal prefix Ar(a)- in their names. Tuor's\nheirs did not have a valid claim to the High Kingship of the Ñoldor,\nalthough his heir Elrond, who chose Elvish immortality, later was\nreckoned as a leader of the Ñoldor.\n\nWith Sauron defeated and the One Ring lost, the Elves were free to use\nthe three rings to create their enchanted kingdoms. However, Cirdan\ngave his to Gandalf to aid him in his labours. In at least two realms,\nRivendell and Lothlórien, the bliss of the Eldar was preserved. Those\nElves who dwelt within these regions again tasted the bliss of Valinor\nand did not feel the weight of time. In the Third Age, the Ñoldor\ndwindled, and by the end of the Third Age the only Ñoldor remaining in\nMiddle-earth were in Rivendell, with the exception of Galadriel in\nLothlórien. The Three rings were free from any evil, having been\nmade without Sauron ever seeing them. But since they were still made by\nthe same art as the other rings, the Three were still bound to the One\nRing. With the One Ring's destruction and Sauron's permanent defeat, the\npower of the three rings faded and the last of the Ñoldor Elves began to\ngrow weary again. Eventually, Galadriel and Elrond took the ship for\nValinor and departed Middle-earth and Lothlórien was abandoned. From the\nFourth Age and beyond Rivendell was the only remaining Ñoldorian\nsettlement left in Middle Earth, ruled by Elladan and Elrohir who\nremained behind when Elrond left.\n\n\nHigh Kings\n\n1.  Finwë, first High King\n2.  Fëanor, first son of Finwë\n3.  Fingolfin, second son of Finwë. Though some supported Maedhros, the\n    eldest son of Feanor, Maedhros himself laid aside his claim and\n    supported Fingolfin instead.\n4.  Fingon, first son of Fingolfin.\n5.  Turgon, second son of Fingolfin.\n6.  Ereinion Gil-galad, son of Fingon according to the Silmarillion\n\n\n\nAfter Gil-galad's death, the High Kingship in Middle-earth under the\nÑoldor came to an end. Of the descendents of Finwë, the descendants of\nElros (the Kings of Arnor) did claim the title High King but there is no\nindication that this referred anything other than a High Kingship over\nthe Dúnedain. It is unclear whether Elros and his brother Elrond were\nconsidered eligible at all, but Elrond never claimed Kingship, implying\nthat they were not. However, at this point, the number of Ñoldor\nremaining in Middle Earth was few, and Elrond might have simply deemed\nthe question moot.\n\nAccording to the Silmarillion, Finarfin took the kingship of those\nÑoldor who remained in Aman during the Exile, though whether he was\nconsidered a “High King” or not (either at the time of the Exile and\nafter the War of Wrath) is unclear. Another possibility is that in Aman\nthere was no High King other than Ingwë. Although Miriel had renounced\nher right to re-embody (as per the rules of the Statute of Finwë and\nMíriel), there is no reason that Finwë might not have done so (and, in\nfact, the text of the Silmarillion implies that eventually he did).\nSimilarly, as lineal heir to Turgon, Earendil the Mariner might have\nmade a claim. The question of who held kingship over the Ñoldor after\nthe War of the Last Alliance remains unanswered.\n\nMuch of this speculation stems from attempts to divine the rules of\ninheritance and succession for the Ñoldor. Among humans, the “divine\nright” implied by Tolkien follows the rules of primogeniture. On the\nother hand, elves are immortal, and can reincarnate even if they are\nphysically killed. Iron-clad rules for succession may simply not exist.\nSupporting this viewpoint is the controversy between Fingolfin and\nMaedhros. It can be read that Maedhros had, but gave up, the “right” to\nHigh Kingship; on the other hand, these might have simply been the two\nstrongest contenders for the position. Asserting but giving up a right\nwould automatically forestall claims from his younger brothers, and\nprovide legitimacy to Fingolfin that elves of every party would\nrecognize.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Ñoldor_ is a Quenya term meaning 'those with knowledge'. _LACHEND_ was\none Sindarin name that other Elves gave them, which translates as\n'flame-eyed'. \n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn the early versions of Tolkien's Middle-earth mythology (see: _The\nHistory of Middle-earth_), the ÑOLDOR were most often called _NOLDOLI_\n(not _Ñoldoli_) or “GNOMES”. They were still called Gnomes in early\neditions of _The Hobbit_. They were also the ones who spoke the language\nthat later became Sindarin (then called Gnomish). Beren and Luthien\n(2017) reintroduces the use of Gnomes and Noldoli in the complete tale.\n\nThe spelling _Ñoldor_ rather than _Noldor_ is used in later writings,\nbut even in earlier versions the name _Ñoldo_ came from a Primitive\nQuendian stem *NGolodō, which led to _NGoldo_ (Ñoldo) in Quenya and\n_GOLODH_ in Sindarin. However, by the Third Age, Quenya as it was spoken\nin Middle-earth had voiced the “ng” phoneme as a regular “n”, making the\neffective pronunciation during the Age as _Noldor_.\n\nThe family tree given above is correct in the placement of Orodreth and\nGil-galad: Orodreth was Angrod's son, and Gil-galad was Orodreth's son,\nthus the grandson of Angrod and great-grandson of Finarfin, and brother\nto Finduilas. These are wrongly placed in the published _Silmarillion_.\n(See Orodreth and Gil-galad articles for details). Argon, the third son\nof Fingolfin, does not appear in the published _Silmarillion_ at all."

    "page_id": "283",
    "text": "EASTERLINGS, known in early times as SWARTHY MEN, were a race of Men who\nlived in the vast and uncharted lands of Rhûn, east of Mordor and the\nSea of Rhûn. Easterlings were enemies of the Free Peoples and were\nallies of Sauron. There were many different nations and kingdoms of\nEasterlings living in the vast lands of Rhûn. These ranged from\ncivilized empires to barbaric horse nomads of the open steppes.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nEasterlings, being of many different races and people, were either tall\nand sallow-skinned or short and swarthy. However, there were also said\nto be a different type of Easterlings that appeared during the Siege of\nGondor from unknown eastern lands, who were broad, short, and\nbearded, and wielded axes like Dwarves. Easterlings were the most\nnumerous and deadly of the enemies of the Free Peoples, and it is said\nif the Blue Wizards had not been sent into Rhûn the hosts of the East\nwould have outnumbered the Western peoples. Their skin was either sallow\n(a pale yellow) or olive. Their eyes were dark (dark brown and black),\nand their straight hair was black. The “swarthier” Easterlings of the\nFirst Age and the Fourth Ages were not a related people, as those of the\nFirst came from the then-unknown lands east of the Blue Mountains, and\ncould have had more relation to the Dunlendings than the later Balchoth\nand Wainriders.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFirst Age\n\n\n\nDuring the First Age, the term was applied to the sons of Bór and\nUlfang, or the _Swarthy Men_, who came into Beleriand much later than\nthe Edain, and who were for a part secretly in league with Morgoth.\nBy some men of Dor-lómin that appear in the Wanderings of Hurin, they\nare called EASTRONS.\n\nBór was a leader of Men who came into Lothlann, in Beleriand, during the\nFA 463. His sons were Borlach, Borlad, and Borthand. Bór was welcomed\nby Maedhros, who gave him and his followers land north and south of the\nMarch of Maedhros. Bór and his sons swore allegiance to Maedhros, and\nremained faithful, though he was told by Morgoth to betray the banner of\nCaranthir. All of them were wiped out during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.\n\nUlfang also came in Lothlann, Beleriand, in 463, shortly after Bór.\nHe was the father of Ulfast, Ulwarth, and Uldor “the Accursed”. Ulfang\nwas welcomed by the sons of Fëanor, and he and his sons swore allegiance\nto Caranthir. They were given lands to dwell in the north and south of\nthe March of Maedhros. Ulfang and his sons were secretly in the employ\nof Morgoth, and betrayed the Eldar and Edain during the Nirnaeth\nArnoediad in what is now known as the Treachery of Men.\n\nRule in Hithlum\n\nAfter Nirnaeth Arnoediad at the bidding of Morgoth, the Easterlings\ninvaded Hithlum. They spread throughout the wide lands plundering,\ndestroying, and killing its inhabitants. The Eldar of Hithlum were able\nto escape from the invaders by taking refuge in the southern mountains\nthat later the Easterlings avoided out of fear of the Elves. The\nEasterlings soon withdrew northwards and apparently settled.\n\nHowever, the Easterlings were betrayed by their lord Morgoth, and locked\nsolely in Hithlum and denied the rich lands of the Beleriand that they\nso desired. Here the Easterlings governed with cruelty, robbing,\nstealing, and enslaving the remaining Men of Hithlum, who called the\nEasterlings the \" Incomers\". They took away the young and the able\nbodied and sometimes young women to be wives; the most widely known\nbeing Aerin of whom Brodda took to produce his heir. Despite these evil\ndeeds, they did not take Morwen nor her house from her for they feared\nher and believed her to be a witch and so her son had time to escape to\nDoriath. Tuor, the cousin of Túrin was also enslaved in Hithlum by the\nEasterlings but he was able to escape and evaded them by living as an\noutlaw, until he was contacted by the Vala Ulmo and went to\nGondolin.\n\nThe Easterlings ruled effectively in Hithlum as vassals of Morgoth from\nFA 473 to FA 583. After the War of Wrath, those that survived fled back\nover the Blue Mountains to Eriador and beyond where they sat themselves\nup as kings and chieftains of many of the Middle Men.\n\nSecond Age\n\nA King of the Easterlings, Khamûl, was given one of the Rings of Power\nand became a powerful sorcerer, until the power of the Ring corrupted\nhim. Around SA 2251, Khamûl became a Wraith and one of Sauron's\nservants.\n\nThird Age\n\n\n\nDuring the Third Age, the term was applied to the various nations and\ntribes of Men living in the uncharted lands east of the Sea of Rhûn and\nMordor who were usually allied with Sauron (for one of their leaders was\nthe second greatest of the Nazgûl, Khamûl) and frequently attacked\nGondor and the lands bordering Rhûn. However, Sauron's defeat at the end\nof the War of the Last Alliance diminished his presence for over one\nthousand years, and any territorial ambition was left to them alone. In\nTA 490 they invaded Gondor, passing through Dagorlad and starting a\nseries of wars that lasted sixty years until they were finally defeated\nin TA 550 by Turambar, the ninth King of Gondor. Afterwards, Gondor\nsubdued some of them and took from them a large area of land between the\nKingdom of Rhovanion and Mordor including the Sea of Rhûn.\n\nGondor held on to these territories for a few hundred years but slowly\nbegan to lose them over time, and the Easterlings once again initiated\nwarfare. In TA 1248 they once again clashed with Gondor in a series of\nskirmishes but were still not powerful or organized enough to stand\nagainst Gondor’s power. Though defeated the Easterlings would not\nhave to wait long, for Gondor soon fell into decline and civil war.\nAfterwards, the Easterling tribes remained peaceful for the most part\nuntil the mid-nineteenth century when they were again powerful enough to\nattack the west.\n\nThe War of the Ring\n\nDuring the War of the Ring at the end of the Third Age, the Easterlings\njoined with the forces of Mordor participating in the Northern battles\nthat nearly defeated the Elves of Mirkwood, Men of Dale, and the Dwarves\nof the Lonely Mountain.\n\nDespite being on the losing side in the war, some Easterlings still\ncontinued to remain a threat throughout the early Fourth Age but were\nfinally subdued in a series of campaigns led by King Elessar. In these\nbattles the Easterlings, aside from the hordes of Orcs, were the most\nnumerous and tenacious of Sauron's warriors.\n\n\nSpecific groups\n\nWainriders\n\nThe Wainriders were a confederation of Easterling and Haradrim tribes\nwho were united by their hate of Gondor, fueled by the Dark Lord Sauron.\nFollowing the Great Plague which weakened Gondor, they started their\nattacks in TA 1856, defeating a Gondor army at the Battle of the Plains\nand killing King Narmacil II. They rode in great chariots (which gave\nthem their name), and raided the lands of Rhovanion, destroying or\nenslaving its people. Gondor gradually lost all of its possessions east\nof Anduin to them.\n\nIn TA 1899, the thirtieth King of Gondor, Calimehtar son of Narmacil,\ndefeated the Wainriders at Dagorlad, buying some rest for his land.\nHowever the Wainriders struck back in TA 1944, allying themselves with\nthe Haradrim of Near Harad and the Variags of Khand. Before this they\nhad been expanding their power southward, beyond Mordor, and had come\ninto conflict with the tribes of Khand and the eastern Haradrim. But\neventually these men allied under their universal hate of the West. They\nmanaged to kill King Ondoher and all his heirs, but instead of riding on\nto Minas Anor and taking the city, they paused to celebrate.\n\nMeanwhile, general Eärnil of Gondor's southern army rode north to defend\nhis king defeating an inferior force of Haradrim in South Ithilien, he\ncame too late to rescue Ondoher, but he did manage to annihilate the\nWainriders for good at the Battle of the Camp. Eärnil was crowned king.\nAfter this defeat the might of the Wainriders was broken, and they\nretreated east. They still held Rhovanion, but never troubled Gondor\nagain until the War of the Ring.\n\nBalchoth\n\n\n\nThe Balchoth were a fierce race of Easterlings, who attacked Gondor\nwhile under orders of Dol Guldur. In TA 2510, they overran the plains of\nCalenardhon and almost destroyed the army of the Ruling Steward Cirion,\nbut were defeated by the Éothéod under Eorl the Young. Like the\nWainriders they rode in chariots and wagons, and they may have been\ndescendants of these people. However, they were notably far more\nprimitive and savage than the advanced Wainriders, so their origin is at\nmost obscure.\n\n\nWeapons\n\nNot much is known about the weapons used by the Easterlings. They had as\nfar as it is known among their arsenal spears, bows, axes and chariots.\nThey also seemed to favor the horse on many occasions, although all this\nprobably differed greatly among the Easterling tribes, kingdoms, or\nempires.\n\n\nCulture\n\nKnowledge of the culture of the Easterlings is limited. In the First Age\nthey could be quite savage; examples of this rise from Brodda's\ntreatment of the Men of the House of Hador in Dor-lómin. In the Third\nAge at least, the Easterlings fought with great valor, as displayed\nduring the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and the Battle of the Black\nGate. The numerous clans of the Easterlings were united by Emperors and\nKings of Rhûn (like Khamûl). An Emperor of the Easterlings was supposed\nto have led an army to the Battle of Dale and supported Sauron.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film trilogy\n\n\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers_, an army from Rhûn is seen by\nFrodo, Gollum, and Sam entering the Black Gate. The corresponding\npassage in the book describes them as Easterlings; in the movie they are\nthe same, quite distinct from the Haradrim passing through Ithilien\nlater in the film. During this encounter, Sam accidentally falls down a\nslope near to where Easterlings are passing by. Frodo goes after him,\nand two Easterling warriors notice the commotion; they leave the\nformation to inspect. Frodo hides himself and Sam under his elvish\ncloak, disguising them as a boulder. The Easterling soldiers almost find\nthem, but eventually return to their legion and march into Mordor.\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_ they are also seen\nbriefly after the gate of Minas Tirith has been breached. There they\nadvance upon the soldiers of Gondor, but they are not seen fighting.\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\n_The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_ depicts one of the Nazgûl in\narmor resembling that of the Easterlings; this is undoubtedly intended\nto be Khamûl.\n\nInspirations\n\nIn Peter Jackson's film series, the Easterlings are depicted as a\nheavily-stylized, vaguely Middle Eastern culture. This caused some\ncontroversy after the films were released. In the appendices of the\nSpecial Extended Edition of _The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers_, the\nartists claim that they were inspired by a variety of Persian cultures,\nparticularly Sassanid Persians, Mongol horsemen, and Ottoman Turks. They\nhave “crests” on the backs of their hat-like helmets that resemble\nfeudal Samurai crests. They also bear a rising sun emblem upon their\narmor. The full-body armor the Easterlings wear resembles armor which\nancient Chinese soldiers wore. Beneath their armor they wear veils,\nheadscarves, and robes. In some movie-models, their boots have upturned\ntoes, suggesting a Mongolic or Persian influence.\n\nVideo games\n\n-   Easterlings also appear in _The Lord of the Rings Online_, in the\n    Brown Lands bordering with the Parth Celebrant region, where they\n    established a couple of settlements, and in many other regions south\n    of this, where they threaten the eastern borders of Rohan and in\n    some cases join in invaders of Gondor. They belong to a few tribes:\n    the Balchoth, the Jangovar, the Khundolar, the Variags, and the\n    Wainriders.\n-   Easterling pikemen are a unit in all three _The Battle for\n    Middle-earth_ games, available to the Mordor faction.\n\nMilitary in adaptations\n\n\n\nThe armor of the Easterlings entering the Black Gates was made from\nbronze, along with the helmet; its dragon-skull-shape was made to\nintimidate enemies.\n\nTheir gold or brass overlayed steel lamellar armor consisted of a\nplacard (stomach plate), gorget (heart & neck coverage), groin-plate,\nrerebraces (upper arm), vambraces (forearm), cuisses (thighs), and\npoleyns (knees). The clothing that the Men of Rhûn wore consisted of red\nleather gloves, black leather tall boots, burgundy long pants, a\nburgundy tunic with long sleeves, a burgundy headscarf, and a black\nfacecloth . The undercut, brass helmet was worn over the headscarf, and\nfeatured cheek-and-eye guards, along with two horns from the back and a\ncrest on the front, to remind other beings of dragons, intimidating to\nthe enemy even before the battle began.\n\nDuring battle, these heavy infantrymen formed the core of Sauron's\narmies, for they were taller and better-equipped than the swarming Orcs\nthat fully comprised his forces.\n\nThe curved, rectangular, two-foot by three-foot Easterling shield had\nconcave top and bottom edges and was made with brass that surrounded a\ndark-brown square. It was held by an iron handgrip that was behind a\nbrass circular boss surrounded by a diamond shape that was itself\nenveloped by the square. It came with a dark-red leather “belt” if the\nMan of Rhûn was to strap the shield to the forearm for combat requiring\ntwo hands. Even archery was allowed by this big strap. One rather\nstriking detail on Rhûnic armor was that a sun was etched into their\nsternum-plate, resembling a burning of a grassland such as Rohan or\nDale.\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game_, the\nEasterlings have a unique type of cavalry known as _kataphrakts*_. These\nwere Easterlings mounted upon heavily armored horses and wielding a\nscimitar and broad shield. They were notorious for their ferocity of\ntheir attacks and defensive power when they were deployed side-by-side.\nThe brass lamellar armor on the fronts of their horses allowed them to\nsafely trample spearmen and pikemen. Rhunic composite short-bows were\nsometimes taken instead of shields. \n\n_Kataphrakts_ is from the ancient Greek derivative word ''Kataphraktos\n_meaning “the armored”, translating to_ Cataphract'' in English.\nCataphracts were heavily armored cavalry used as elite troops or\nbodyguards. The Sassanid Persian Empire had elite troops called the\n“Savaran Cataphracts”. Cataphracts are thought to have been developed as\nearly as the 8th century B.C. by Middle Eastern cultures such as the\nAssyrians and Achaemenid Empire. Such heavy horse troops were integrated\ninto the Roman Army sometime around the 2nd Century B.C. and became a\ndistinct troop regiment by the time of Hadrion in the 2nd Century A.D."

    "title": "Rohirrim",
    "page_id": "307",
    "text": "The ROHIRRIM were a race of Men who inhabited the land of Rohan, which\nwas named after their famous horses.\n\n\nDescription and Culture\n\nThe Rohirrim were a tall, blonde, and mostly blue-eyed people. They were\nconservative and fiercely independent, remaining within their own\nlanguage and culture. Their horses were very important assets in their\neveryday lives, with their entire culture based around the breeding and\ntrading of them. They lived mostly in villages on the plains of Rohan\nwhere their horses grazed, and had few cities.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Rohirrim were descended from the Éothéod, a race who lived in the\nvales of the Great River Anduin but were removed to Calenardhon, a\nplains-land granted them in perpetuity by the Ruling Steward of Gondor,\nCirion, in reward for the assistance that they offered Gondor at a time\nof great need. As a result, they were lifelong allies of Gondor bound by\nthe Oath of Eorl. At that time Calenardhon was renamed Rohan\n(_Horse-land_) after their many horses. By the Rohirrim themselves Rohan\nis usually called “The Mark”.\n\nThe terms RIDERS OF ROHAN and RIDERS OF THE MARK are commonly used and\nrefer specifically to their mounted soldiers. The former is a chapter\ntitle in _The Two Towers_. The “King's Riders” were specifically the\nhorsemen who formed the king's bodyguard.\n\n\n\nThe Dúnedain of Gondor believed that the Rohirrim were distantly related\nto them (having descended from the Atanatári of the First Age) and\ndescribe them as _Middle Men_, that being inferior to the Númenóreans in\nboth culture and descent, but superior to the _Men of Darkness_ who had\nworshiped and served Sauron.\n\nThe Rohirrim had contacts with Elves in their ancient history, and knew\nof Eru, but like the Dúnedain they did not worship him in any temples.\nThey seem to have highly valued the Vala Oromë the Hunter, whom they\ncalled _Béma_.\n\nThey are ruled by a line of kings descended from Eorl the Young, who had\nfirst brought them to Rohan, and in time of war every able man rode to\nmeet the Muster of Rohan.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Rohirrim_ is Sindarin for PEOPLE OF THE HORSE-LORDS (sometimes\ntranslated simply as HORSE-LORDS) and are mostly used by outsiders: the\nname they had for themselves are EORLINGAS, after their king Eorl the\nYoung who had first brought them to Rohan. _Rohirrim_ is a collective\nnoun, and when used grammatically as a subject or object is usually used\nwith the definite article (i.e. _the Rohirrim_). It can also be used as\nan adjective to modify another noun (e.g., a Rohirrim village, a troop\nof Rohirrim cavalry, etc.) The pure adjectival form, meaning “pertaining\nto the Rohirrim,” is _Rohirric_ (Rohirric tactics, Rohirric culture,\netc.)\n\n\nAnglo-Saxon Connection\n\nThe Rohirrim seem to resemble the ancient\nAnglo-Saxons, a Germanic people comprising three tribes, the Angles, the\nSaxons, and the Jutes, who invaded and conquered Britain around the 5th\ncentury. Tolkien was himself a distinguished professor of the\nAnglo-Saxon language (Old English).\n\nThe people of Rohan resemble the Anglo-Saxons in several ways. In\nappearance they are fair skinned and mostly blond haired, like the\nGermanic invaders, but they also have cultural links to those ancient\ntribes. This is shown in the type of armour used by Rohirric warriors,\nwhich includes an extensive choice of mail, both chain and scaled, and\nin their reverence for the sword as an expensive yet symbolically\nimportant weapon, to be given a title and passed down through\ngenerations.\n\nRohirric armies are also known to favour the shield-wall, which was a\nstrategy commonly employed by the Anglo-Saxons. Finally, common names\ngiven to the people of Rohan tend to resemble names of Old English. For\ninstance, the name Éomer is found in the Beowulf saga (an epic Tolkien\nbuilt much of his career around), and means “horse-famous” in Old\nEnglish. While these traits of the Rohirrim could be passed off as\ntypical of any agricultural, Northern society of Europe, such as the\nVikings, taken as a whole and with the knowledge that Tolkien was an\nacclaimed professor of Anglo-Saxon and indeed had set out to create a\nuniquely “English” mythology, it can be inferred that the descriptions\nof the Rohirrim were heavily drawn from those of the ancient\nAnglo-Saxons.\n\nHowever one aspect of the Rohirrim, their close affinity to horses as\nbeasts of warfare and their extensive and superb use of cavalry, is not\na trait that is shared with the ancient Anglo-Saxon tribes, who were\npredominately foot-soldiers in wartime. (It was, however, characteristic\nof the Ostrogoths, a Germanic tribe that dominated eastern Europe during\nthe late Roman period, whose language was also studied by Tolkien.)\nTolkien's choice to represent the Northern-descended Rohirrim as a\nhorse-loving people is in itself quite interesting, but is obviously\npart of his unique mythology. Yet it has been argued that one possible\nreason for the horse inclusion is the events of 1066 in England.\nAccording to Tom Shippey, Tolkien imagined the Rohirrim to be a\nhorse-culture because the only surviving Anglo-Saxon words for color\nwere all words for the colors of horses.\n\nAt this point the Anglo-Saxons were defeated by the invading Normans,\nwho were able to win the battle through their superior use of cavalry.\nTherefore, it has been stated that this inclusion may an idea influenced\nby this, that if the Anglo-Saxon had been horse-lords they could have\nwon the Battle of Hastings thus preserving the Anglo-Saxon culture which\nTolkien enjoyed. Certainly, whether the Rohirrim truly are partly or\nwholly based on the Anglo-Saxons can be a topic of debate among Tolkien\nfans and scholars."

    "text": "ITHILIEN was a region and fiefdom of Gondor bordering Mordor in eastern\nMiddle-earth.\n\nIthilien, or MOON-LAND, was the easternmost province of Gondor, the only\npart of Gondor across the Great River Anduin lying between the river and\nthe Ephel Dúath, subdivided by the stream of Morgulduin into North and\nSouth Ithilien.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIt was a fair and prosperous land during the Second Age and the first\npart of the Third Age, filled with many woods and gardens, when Gondor\nwas strong and Mordor deserted. Of old its chief city was _Minas Ithil_,\nbut when this was captured by Mordor in TA 2002 it was renamed Minas\nMorgul. After this ,the population gradually migrated across the Anduin\nto escape the looming threat of Ringwraiths from Minas Morgul.\n\nIthilien was reoccupied by hardy folk during the Watchful Peace, but in\nTA 2475 the Watchful Peace was broken when Uruks from Mordor devastated\nthe province; and although they were driven back to the Morgul Vale by\nBoromir I, raids never entirely ceased after this time. Several\ncenturies later attacks by Orcs and Haradrim continue and in TA 2901 the\nraids grew so severe that the remainder of the population of Ithilien\nfled across Anduin and Gondor withdrew from the province, and after the\nreturn of Sauron to Mordor the land was finally abandoned. However the\nStewards of Gondor still kept scouts in Ithilien, based on secret\nlocations such as _Henneth Annûn_, which were built shortly after\n2901. In TA 2954 Mount Doom burst into flame and those few farmers\nwho remained fled Westward over Anduin, leaving only the Rangers behind\nto harry the servants of Sauron.\n\n\n\nIn the narrative of _The Lord of the Rings_, Gollum leads Frodo Baggins\nand Samwise Gamgee through Ithilien on the way to the pass of Cirith\nUngol into Mordor. The land is described in the text as “a fair country\nof climbing woods and swift-falling streams”, with gentle slopes,\n“shielded from the east by the Ephel Dúath and yet not under the\nmountain-shadow, protected from the north by the Emyn Muil, open to the\nsouthern airs and the moist winds from the Sea”. It is also stated that\n“a wealth of sweet-smelling herbs and shrubs” and a vast array of tree\nspecies grew in Ithilien, some of them having been planted by men in\ndays of peace, and that despite desolation the land “kept still a\ndishevelled dryad loveliness”. After witnessing a battle with\nSouthrons of Harad accompanied by Mumakil, the hobbits are found by the\nRangers of Ithilien, under the command of Faramir, the son of the\nSteward Denethor II, but are allowed to continue when he is satisfied\nthey are not agents of Sauron.\n\nAfter the events of the War of the Ring, King Elessar granted to Faramir\nthe Princedom of Ithilien and the Lordship of Emyn Arnen (Faramir also\nmaintained the Office of the Steward, even after he tried to surrender\nit to King Elessar). Emyn Arnen, being the ancestral home of the\nStewards of Gondor, became the official home of the Steward Faramir and\nhis descendants.\n\nDuring the Fourth Age, the region was ruled by the Princes of Ithilien,\na line that started with Faramir and Éowyn (the White Lady of Ithilien).\nMinas Ithil maybe repopulated after Faramir cleaned the evil-remnants in\nMorgul Vale, and Faramir ruled as Lord of Emyn Arnen. A colony was\nsettled in Ithilien by the Elves of Mirkwood and former residents of\nElven kingdoms in the north, welcomed there by Legolas, and “it became\nonce again the fairest country in all the westlands”, until after\nsome time all Elves had departed over the Sea. The colony only lasted\nfor about a century, because many Elves left for Valinor after Elessar's\ndeath in FO 120\n\n\nPlaces\n\nHenneth Annûn\n\n\n\nHENNETH ANNÛN was a hidden outpost of Gondor in North Ithilien, founded\n(like all of Gondor's hidden refuges in Ithilien) by the command of\nSteward Túrin II shortly after Ithilien was made desolate by the\nincursions of Orcs of Mordor around TA 2901 and maintained the\nlongest of such refuges. Henneth Annûn was the longest-lasting of all\nthe refuges of Ithilien.\n\nThis secret refuge (the name means _Window of the Sunset_ in Sindarin)\nconsisted of a cave behind a west-facing waterfall overlooking a pool,\nthe “Window-curtain” stated to have been the “fairest of the falls of\nIthilien.” The cave had been excavated by the stream feeding the\nwaterfall, which originally fell from the hole in the cliff constituting\nthe window in the name, but that stream had since been diverted by the\nMen of Gondor to fall from doubled height, and the tunnel had been\nsealed, except for a concealed entrance along the brink of a deep pool\nbeneath the waterfall.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Faramir son of Steward Denethor II had his\nbase of operations there, and Frodo Baggins and his companion Samwise\nGamgee were taken there by his company.\n\nEmyn Arnen\n\nEMYN ARNEN is a series of hills at the centre of Ithilien, south of\nOsgiliath, standing opposite to Minas Tirith across Anduin and around\nwhich the river made a bend. Emyn Arnen means “Hills Beside the Water”\nin Sindarin, referring to its proximity to the Great River, Anduin.\n\nFrom this place originated the line of later Stewards of Gondor. It was\nhome to a family of Númenórean nobles, and from them came Húrin, chosen\nby King Minardil of Gondor to be his Steward. Later Kings of Gondor only\nchose their stewards from among Húrin's descendants, and eventually the\nStewardship of Gondor became hereditary (the stewards named themselves\nmembers of the House of Húrin).\n\nAfter the War of the Ring the Lordship of the hills was granted to\nFaramir, Prince of Ithilien and Steward to the King Elessar. The element\n_arnen_ in the name was stated by Tolkien to have been of\npre-Númenórean origin, while _emyn_ is a Sindarin word for “hills”.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_ITHILIEN_ is a Sindarin word that means 'Moon-land'."

    "title": "Maiar",
    "page_id": "312",
    "text": "The MAIAR (the singular of which is MAIA) were nearly-primordial spirits\nthat descended into Arda to help the Valar first shape the World. They\nwere supposed to be numerous, yet not many were named. Their chiefs were\nEönwë, banner-bearer and herald of Manwë, and Ilmarë, the handmaid of\nVarda.\n\nFive of these spirits, in the Third Age, were the incarnated Wizards.\n\n\nHistory\n\nEach of the Maiar is associated with one or more particular Vala, and\nwere of similar stock, though less powerful. For example, Ossë and\nUinen, as spirits of the sea, belonged to Ulmo the Sea-King, while\nCurumo (known in Middle-earth as Saruman) belonged to Aulë the Smith.\nOthers included Mairon (originally also of Aulë, known in Middle-earth\nas Sauron), Aiwendil (known in Middle-earth as Radagast), who belonged\nto Yavanna the Fruit-Giver, and Olórin, (known by the Elves as\nMithrandir but came to Middle-Earth as Gandalf), who belonged to Manwë\nthe Wind-King and Varda the Star-Queen. Gandalf's ways took him often to\nthe house of Nienna the Weeper, and from her he learned pity and\npatience, which perhaps aided him in his later struggles to unite the\nFree People of Middle-earth against the power of Sauron.\n\nAlatar and Pallando, later known as the Blue Wizards, travelled to the\nEast, never returning to the West; their fate is unknown, though Tolkien\nwrote that they had probably also failed in their mission, but\nestablished cults in the East. The Balrogs (_Valaraukar_ in Quenta) were\nassociated with Melkor, and were his most trusted and terrible servants.\nMelian served both Vána and Estë.\n\nThe Sun and Moon are also piloted by Maiar: Arien, a spirit of fire\nuncorrupted by Melkor, was chosen for her radiant beauty and fierce\ndevotion to the workings of the Valar, was chosen to guide the sun,\nwhile Tilion, a hunter in the company of Oromë, was chosen to steer the\nmoon.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\n\n\nMaiar, like Valar, do not array themselves in a fixed form, but can\nfreely change their form. Olórin, or Gandalf, walked among the several\npeoples of Middle-earth in an uncertain form for many years before being\nsent on the errand of the Valar as one of the _Istari_.\n\nAlso like Valar, however, this power can be lost when that power is\nspent in hate and mockery, Sauron, following the dark trails blazed by\nMelkor, took upon the form of - and remained - the Dark Lord in the\nSecond Age. And yet, Maiar retain their immortality. From all\nindications, when the physical body of a Maia is destroyed, their spirit\nwanders houseless and their power diminished, until they are either able\nto take a physical form once more, or are restored by their\ncorresponding Valar. Examples of this can be seen in the threat of\nLuthien to Sauron upon his defeat at the Tower of Werewolves, whereby it\nis said:\n\n_“Ere  spirit left its dark house, Luthien came to him and\nthat he should be stripped of his raiment of flesh, and his ghost sent\nquaking back to Morgoth; and she said 'There everlastingly thy naked\nself shall endure the torment of his scorn, pierced by his eyes, unless\nthou yield to me the mastery of thy tower.'”_\n\nFurther example includes the resurrection of Gandalf after he and the\nBalrog of Moria were both slain, one by the other, on the mountain peak\nof Zirakzigil:\n\n“_Naked I was sent back – for a brief time, until my task is done. And\nnaked I lay upon the mountain-top. There I lay staring upward, while the\nstars wheeled over, and each day was as long as a life-age of the\nearth._”\n\nIt is not clear how, or what, restored Gandalf, though it can be\ninferred that Manwë played some role in it. It was Manwë, after all,\nthat sent the Istari on their errand to check the power of Sauron in\nMiddle-earth; therefore, by Gandalf declaring that he was sent back\n“until  task is done”, indicates some level of Manwe's involvement;\nor as argued by some it was the direct intervention of Eru Ilúvatar that\nbrought about Gandalf's return.\n\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nLike most of the Ainur, the abilities and powers of the Maiar remain\nunknown and presumably diverse. Given the nature the Maiar were to aid\nthe Valar in the shaping of the world; they presumably have considerable\npower to augment the world around them. Maiar, as primordial spirit\nbeings, are functionally immortal and essentially immune to the ravages\nof time, even from physical destruction they remain in spirit form.\n\nBeing of divine origin, they can shapeshift if they so choose. They\nwander the world unseen or shape themselves in any fashion, be they\nElves or other creatures; called ''“Fanar” ''in Quenya could be\ndestroyed but their being not extinguished.\n\nIt is suggested that the Maiar, in their service to the Valar in shaping\nthe world, presumably had the ability to manipulate the elements and\nenergies like their Valar counterparts. They were able to be given a\nphysical body again over time or with help with the Valar. Presumably\nthe Maiar possessed the abilities to perform Magic, thus being able to\nperform blessings, spells, curses, exorcism, etc.\n\nGiven the vastness of the universe and the ability of the Maiar to\noccupy such points, they are capable of teleporting vast distances. By\ntaking the form of a flying creature like vampires, bats, birds etc. the\nAinur were able to fly.\n\n\nNamed Maiar\n\n-   Alatar (Morinehtar)\n-   Aiwendil (Radagast)\n-   Arien\n-   Curumo (Saruman)\n-   Eönwë\n-   Durin's Bane\n-   Gothmog\n-   Ilmarë\n-   Mairon (Sauron)\n-   Melian\n-   Olórin (Gandalf)\n-   Ossë\n-   Pallando (Rómestámo)\n-   Salmar\n-   Thorondor (speculation)\n-   Tilion\n-   Uinen\n-   Ungoliant (speculation)"

    "text": "The SINDAR (meaning _Grey People_, singular _Sinda_, although the latter\nterm was not generally used) were Elves of Telerin descent. They are\nalso known as the GREY ELVES. They are a sub-group of the Eldar and a\nfurther sub-group of the Teleri. They are the Elves that chose to remain\nin Beleriand and not complete the Great Journey.\n\nSindar was the name given by the Noldorin exiles to those of the Teleri\nwho lived in Beleriand and did not complete the Great Journey. The\nSindar are called “grey” perhaps because they were not Elves of the\nLight, never having actually set foot in Valinor, but neither were they\nAvari, since they did accept the invitation and set out on the journey\n(and therefore were technically counted among the Eldar). They are\nsometimes referred to as ELVES OF THE TWILIGHT. The term _grey_ may also\nrefer to Elu Thingol's grey cloak. It may also be related to _Lindar_,\nthe Telerin name for themselves. The name that the Sindar used for\nthemselves was simply _EDHIL_ (“Elves”, singular _Edhel_).\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Teleri were the greatest host of the Eldar. They had two kings, the\nbrothers Elwë Singollo (or Elu Thingol as he was later known in the\nSindarin tongue) and Olwë. When the Teleri reached Beleriand during the\nGreat Journey from Cuiviénen, Thingol went wandering in the forests. In\nthe forest of Nan Elmoth he met Melian, one of the Maiar. They fell in\nlove, and with Melian, Thingol stood spellbound in Nan Elmoth for\nseveral hundred years.\n\nIn the meantime, Olwë and many of the Teleri could not delay longer, and\nwent to Aman without Elwë and his following. Elwë's followers stayed in\nBeleriand, to search for their king. At long last, he awoke from the\nspell and set up a kingdom in the midst of Beleriand: Eglador (Land of\nthe Forsaken, or Land of the Elves). The Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost\nin the Blue Mountains were contracted to aid in the building of the city\nof Menegroth.\n\nOther Teleri also stayed behind: these were the friends of Ossë the\nMaia, who had fallen in love with the shores of Middle-earth, and did\nnot wish to depart. Their leader was Círdan, and they established cities\nat Eglarest and Brithombar. They were known as the Falathrim, or Elves\nof the Falas (Shore). They were not part of the realm of Eglador, but\nstill took Thingol as their High King.\n\nYet other stray bands of Teleri settled in Nevrast and Hithlum to the\nnorth of Eglador, although these did not form any realms. The Teleri of\nEglador, the northlands, and the Falas were also known as Sindar, in\nlater days, because they developed a civilisation all their own, which\nalmost equaled that of the Calaquendi.\n\nA last group of Teleri in Beleriand was the Laiquendi: they were\ndescended from the Nandor, who had split from the Great Journey before\nthe Hithaeglir, and gone south along the Great River Anduin. A part of\nthem, under Denethor, son of Lenwë, crossed the Blue Mountains, and\neventually settled in Ossiriand, or as it was later known: Lindon. They\nremained a people apart for long, although many of them removed to\nThingol's realm after Denethor was killed.\n\nThe friends of Elwë Singollo, who remained waiting for him while he was\nlost in Nan Elmoth, and the Falathrim, were persuaded to remain on the\nHither Shores by Ossë. Later the Laiquendi and the other Nandor who\nentered Beleriand were often counted among the Sindar. Although they\nwere Moriquendi Elves and thus never went to Aman, the Sindar achieved\ngreat wisdom during the Sleep of Yavanna, for they were guided by\nCírdan, Melian the Maia, and Elwë, who as Elu Thingol who had returned\nas a great overlord of Elves. Thingol's kingdom was to become the center\nof Sindarin power and culture. Many Sindar lived in Mithrim and the\nFalas, and some still wandered in the forests.\n\nThe Sindar were somewhat scorned but respected by the Ñoldorin exiles\nwho returned to Middle-earth to found great realms and wage war against\nthe Dark Lord Morgoth, and many Sindarin Elves considered them usurpers\nand to blame for Morgoth's return. The Sindar did not play a very active\noffensive role in the The Battles of Beleriand in the War of the Great\nJewels, although they did suffer heavily from the forces of Morgoth.\nTheir overall relationship with the Ñoldor was a somewhat contentious\none; the Ñoldor, for their part, held themselves in overall higher\nesteem than the Sindar, and were a bit contemptuous of the Sindar's\nrelative lack of will to fight Morgoth. The Sindar often saw their\ncousins as arrogant trespassers, and many also at least somewhat blamed\nthem for the return of Morgoth and all the misery it entailed. At the\nend of the First Age many Sindar went over the Great Sea, and throughout\nsucceeding ages, there was a steady migration of Sindar to the West.\nThose of the Sindar who remained in Middle-earth dwelt in Lindon or in\nElven-realms such as the Woodland Realm. In later ages the Sindar were\ncounted fully among the Eldar.\n\nThe Sindar were happy dwelling in Middle-earth, but once the desire for\nthe Sea was aroused in them, they could not be content until they sailed\nto Eldamar in the Far West. Although less learned and powerful than the\nCalaquendi and less interested in crafts than the Noldor, they were\nextremely gifted in music, and their voices were very fair.\n\n\n\nJust before the arrival of the Ñoldorin exiles, the Dark Lord Morgoth\nreturned to his old stronghold of Angband, and his activities increased.\nThingol had Melian use her magic to create a girdle of bewilderment\naround Eglador, so that nobody could enter without the king's\npermission. Ever after it was known as Doriath. After the return of\nMorgoth and the Ñoldor, Thingol remained High King of the Sindar and\nnominal Overlord of Beleriand, but the Ñoldor, though not openly\nopposing the claim, essentially ignored it, and answered only to the\nauthority of their own High King.\n\n\nSpoken Languages\n\nThe Sindar spoke Sindarin; they invented the Cirth. The language of the\nSindar diverged from common Telerin Elvish over the long ages they were\nsundered from their kin, and became known as Sindarin. By the time the\nÑoldor arrived in Beleriand, the languages had become mutually\nunintelligible, but the Ñoldor were quick to learn it. In the Second and\nThird Age, Sindarin became known as the Noble Tongue, and became the\nElvish tongue used in daily speech throughout Middle-earth (helped by\nthe decree of Thingol, who forbade the use of the Ñoldorin language in\nhis realm). It was also adopted for daily use by the Númenóreans, and\nremained somewhat in use in the Realms in Exile of Gondor and Arnor.\n\nSindarin eventually replaced Ñoldorin Quenya as the language used by the\nÑoldor in Beleriand, even in predominantly Ñoldorin settlements such as\nGondolin, although Quenya survived as a language of universal knowledge\nand ancient lore.\n\n\nHigh Kings of the Sindar\n\n1.  Elu Thingol\n2.  Dior Eluchil\n\n\nThe Half-Elven of Sindarin descent\n\nThe Half-elven, Elrond and Elros, were partially of Sindarin Elven\ndescent, as their mother Elwing was the daughter of Dior, the son of\nLúthien, the daughter of Thingol and Melian."

    "text": "The BATTLES OF THE FORDS OF ISEN were two battles between the forces of\nRohan and Isengard that took place at the Fords of Isen during the War\nof the Ring.\n\nFirst Battle of the Fords of Isen\n\nOutcome: Pyrrhic Rohirrim victory\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSaruman's problem with conquering Rohan swiftly was Théoden's son\nThéodred and his cousin Éomer, for these two men were strong-willed and\npowerful. Saruman knew he had to kill them as soon as possible in order\nto achieve victory, so he launched an attack on the Fords of Isen, which\nwas a very important strategic position in Rohan, for it was the only\nway for large armies to cross the Isen River. Prince Théodred personally\ncommanded the Riders to victory, but after the battle it was very\nobvious to the Rohirrim that Saruman had clearly given orders to his\ntroops to kill the crown prince of Rohan at all cost. If Saruman would\nhave sent his troops into battle with the aim to destroy the Rohirrim,\nthis would have surely been a victory for Isengard and not Rohan. He\nwould have been able to continue the conquering of the Westfold and\ndestroy the army sent out from Edoras before it reached Helm's Deep to\nreinforce the tiny garrison there. Even Gandalf's arrival at Edoras\ncould have not happened, and the war would have been won by Isengard.\n\nThéodred had heard of a troop-gathering in Isengard, and wanted to\ndefeat Saruman's army before it was fully gathered. He left three\ncompanies of cavalry on the eastern shore whilst he himself took eight\ncompanies and a company of bowmen to meet Saruman's troops. But Saruman\nhad already gathered all his troops and sent them south, where they dug\nin and expected Théodred and his army. Theodred defeated a troop of Orcs\nabout 20 miles north of the Fords and went\non to attack the main army, not knowing that they were expecting him. He\nran into them, and wanted to retreat, but fresh troops from Isengard had\nfallen into his western flank. The companies following Théodred's\narrived soon and defeated the enemies in Théodred's back. But as he\nlooked across the river, he saw another army of Isengard marching south\nto the Fords. Théodred immediately ordered the retreat to the Fords, but\nthey were followed by the Orcs. Grimbold took command over the troops on\nthe western shore, and Théodred took the little hill in the middle of\nthe river to safely guard Grimbold if he had to retreat. But Isengard’s\neastern army had now found the Rohirrim on the eastern shore and\nattacked with Wargs, followed by two battalions of Orcs. The unprepared\ntroops on the eastern shore were swiftly destroyed, and Théodred's\nretreating armies, who were on the eastern shore, fled south along the\nIsen, being chased by the Orcs all the while. As the Orcs had control\nover the eastern shore, they sent a troop of orcs armed with axes to\nattack the little hill Théodred was holding. At the same time, Grimbold\nwas attacked on the western shore. The Dunlendings had surrounded the\nhill and were closing in on Théodred and his men, who cried for help.\nGrimbold heard this and took a small company of Rohirrim around him to\naid Théodred. He hewed a path through the axe-men and reached Théodred a\nsecond too late, as he was struck by a big orc. Grimbold killed the orc\nand thought Théodred was dead; and if it not were for Elfhelm, he\nhimself would have died that very moment. Elfhelm had come from Edoras\nand led four companies of cavalry into the battle to reinforce the\nbeleaguered Rohirrim. Isengard's forces were surprised by this new army\ncoming from the east as the Sun rose over the horizon. In the blinding\nsunlight, the Orcs thought that Elfhelm brought a far larger army than\nhe actually did, and many fled from the field—the deserters were pursued\nby two companies of Rohirrim, while those that stood their ground were\nall killed. Elfhelm had ordered the other two companies to guard the\neastern shore and took his own guard to charge the hill where Grimbold\nwas fighting. The Dunlendings were being attacked from both sides and\nwere soon killed. The Rohirrim still held both shores, and Elfhelm\ncharged up the hill to where Grimbold was fighting for Théodred's\nwounded body. Elfhelm rescued Grimbold, and they bent over Théodred to\nhear his last words: “Let me lie here to protect the Fords, until Eomer\narrives”. He died soon after speaking those words. As night fell, the\nOrcs at the western shore retreated. The next morning Théodred’s troops\nthat were chased south by the initial Orcs force arrived, telling the\nsurviving Rohirrim that the Orcs had fled the battlefield, like at the\nwestern shore of the Fords.\n\nSecond Battle of the Fords of Isen\n\nThe command of the ford's garrison was given to Erkenbrand of the\nWestfold. However, until he arrived from Helm's Deep, Grimbold held the\nposition. Grimbold decided to place foot soldiers at the ford and put\nElfhelm's men on the east side where he expected the attack to come\nfrom.\n\nSaruman sent a force which was small, but which still outnumbered the\ndefenders. The attackers forced Grimbold to retreat across the ford with\nheavy losses. Grimbold held the eastern side of the ford and waited for\nElfhelm to come to his aid. More than half of Saruman's force was\nattacking Grimbold's position.\n\nSome Warg Riders and their followers went through the gap between the\ntwo Rohirrim forces and tried to surround Elfhelm. Although he knew\nGrimbold was in danger, Elfhelm retreated eastwards. Grimbold was still\nholding his position when he saw torches coming from the north and from\nIsengard - the vanguard of Saruman's reinforcements advancing towards\nhim. Before he knew it, they had crossed the ford. He could not hold the\nford so he retreated to his camp and made a shield wall around it.\n\nEven though the Rohirrim were surrounded, still the forces of Isengard\ncould not break through. Grimbold knew he could not hold out forever.\nWith no sign of Elfhelm and no help from Erkenbrand, he decided to try\nto break out. He mounted all the riders for whom he had horses and made\na gap on the east side of the wall through which the riders passed. They\nformed into two groups and attacked the north and south sides\nsimultaneously. In the ensuing confusion, the remaining Rohirrim\nretreated on foot as quickly as they could in the dark.\n\nSaruman's commander had finished his first task of creating a supply\nroute into Rohan and he now moved on to his more important task - the\nHornburg.\n\n\nSee Also\n\n-   Ford (disambiguation)\n\nde:Schlachten bei den Furten des Isen"

    "text": "The BATTLE OF THE HORNBURG, also known as BATTLE OF HELM'S DEEP, was the\nfirst grand-scale battle of the War of the Ring where the Rohirrim under\nKing Théoden defended the Hornburg from Saruman's army of Uruk-hai.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the battle\n\nAfter being freed by Gandalf from Gríma Wormtongue's influence, Théoden\nwent to the Fords of Isen where Erkenbrand was battling Saruman's orcs.\nWhen Théoden got there, he realized that the army was scattered, so\nGandalf told Théoden to help the refugees and send them to the Hornburg\nwhere many people from Westfold were also taking refuge. Soon Gandalf\nbrought the Rohirrim to defend Helm's Deep from Saruman's attacking\nforces. A local captain called Gamling the Old led the soldiers.\nUnfortunately, according to Gamling, “The soldiers  seen either too\nmany winters, or too few.”\n\nThe Battle\n\nThe army of Saruman was reinforced by the way due to casualties in the\nbattles of the Fords of Isen it was made up of Uruk-hai, Orcs, Wild Men\nof Dunland and Half-Orcs and they arrived in the middle of the night.\n\nThe Orcs quickly overran the first defence of Helm's Dike, but sustained\nmany losses in it “filling up the dike to the top”. After moving past\nthe Dike the orcs approached the fortress of Hornburg they sent arrows\ninto the fortress. However, they did not get any response. But when they\ngot closer they were met with a volley of arrows and rocks which made\nthem break ranks. The Orcs soon got close enough to Hornburg and\nattempted to break the gate down with tree trunks, but were scattered by\na small attack team led by Aragorn and Éomer from a postern-door that\nran between the brink of the cliff and the wall of the Hornburg. After\nthe team had driven back the Orcs with the ram, the team retreated from\nthe new assault upon the gate. While running back, two Orcs who had\nfaked their deaths knocked Éomer to the ground. As Aragorn ran back to\nsave him, a hidden Gimli hewed the Orcs' heads, saving Éomer and giving\nGimli his first two kills to Legolas' twenty.\n\nThe attackers then raised hundreds of ladders to scale the Deeping Wall;\nthe worn-out defenders threw down the ladders, but were attacked from\nbehind by Orcs who had crawled through the culvert at the base of the\nDeeping Wall. Gimli and Gamling the Old with a unit of men from the\nWestfold attacked the orcs who got through the hole. Gimli, after\ngetting twenty-one kills to Legolas' twenty-four, helped block the\nculvert with stones flooding the stream. Unfortunately, this blockage\nwas destroyed along with a good portion of the Deeping Wall by Saruman's\ndevilry; the fire of Orthanc.  Out from the new larger hole a huge host of Orcs\npoured in, and after a desperate battle in the Deep, the defenders led\nby Éomer, Gimli and Gamling retreated into the Glittering Caves while\nAragorn and Legolas fought their way into the keep via a large stairway\nfrom the Deep to the citadel. During the retreat, Aragorn was overcome\nby Orcs; but was saved by Legolas and a boulder that was cast down upon\nthe Orcs from the wall. Aragorn called for a parley and told the orcs\nthat they would die if they didn't surrender, but the Uruk-hai laughed\nat his threat and attempted to shoot Aragorn down, almost killing him.\nThe Orcs then made it to the gate and destroyed the arch with the\n'blasting-fire'. Suddenly, Théoden and Aragorn led a vicious cavalry\ncharge out of the keep to the blasts of the great horn of Helm, followed\nby the defenders of the Hornburg, driving the Uruks away from the\nremains of the gate. At the same time, Éomer and Gimli with the men from\nthe caves pushed the orcs out of the Deep. The army of the Mark drove\nthe enemy behind the Dike into the Deeping-Coomb. \n\nJust then, Gandalf on his horse Shadowfax arrived with Erkenbrand and a\nthousand swordsmen on foot. They charged the Orcs, trapping them between\nErkenbrand's army, Theoden's army, and the Huorns from Fangorn - and\nSaruman's army was defeated. The orcs and Uruks were driven into the\nforest of Huorns, where they were consumed, and the Dunlendings\nsurrendered and were spared, but were forced to swear never to attack\nRohan again.\n\nImmediate aftermath\n\nLess than half of the 10,000 Uruk-hai survived the main battle, after\nbeing driven into Huorns at most one fourth managed to escape into the\nplains of Rohan. The surviving Dunlendings were sent home and their\nslain were buried in a communal mound. The orc carcasses were simply\npiled off to the side of the battlefield and left to rot. One of the\nRohirrim dead was Háma, a captain of Théoden's personal guard and\ndoorman of Meduseld. Gimli had lost his helmet in the battle and was\nwounded badly on the head, but he had killed forty-two orcs to Legolas'\nforty-one.\n\nLater aftermath\n\nThe battle was critical to the survival of Rohan and their participation\nin the War of the Ring as a whole; had the Rohirrim lost the Battle of\nthe Hornburg, their nation as a whole would have been obliterated by the\nrampaging legions of Saruman's livid Uruk-hai. Merry and Pippin's\npersuasion of Treebeard to attack Isengard was critical as well, and\nguaranteed Rohan's survival for a time.\n\n\nPortrayal in Adaptations\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers_, the city of Edoras was\nevacuated to Helm's Deep. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli accompanied King\nThéoden and his people there. Along the way they were attacked by\nSaruman's Warg-Riders. During this fight, Éowyn led the evacuees on to\nHelm's Deep while the Riders of Rohan fought off the attack. Aragorn\nbecame entangled with the harness of a Warg and was dragged off the side\nof a cliff.After reaching Helm's Deep, the Rohirrim began to prepare for\na siege. During these preparations, Aragorn, who had been found by the\nhorse Brego, arrived with news of 10,000 Uruk-hai coming from Isengard.\nIn response to this, Théoden ordered every male able to bear arms,\nincluding some of the mature children and old men, to be armed and ready\nto fight. Aragorn suggested calling for aid but Théoden didn't believe\nanyone would come. Aragorn also tried lifting the morale of Haleth, one\nof the boy soldiers.\n\nThe Rohirrim were surprised by the arrival of Haldir from Lórien and his\narchers. They were sent by Elrond to support the Rohirrim, in honor of\nthe ancient treaty with the king of Gondor, represented by Aragorn.\nAragorn, Legolas, and Haldir's Elves were stationed on the Deeping Wall,\nwhich ensured that every fortification of the Hornburg was manned.\n\nThe battle began when an older man accidentally fired an arrow at\nthe Uruk-hai, killing one by hitting him in the neck. At first it\nconsisted primarily of volleys of arrows. The Elven Archers demonstrated\ntheir unmatched proficiency of archery, as they loosened devastating\nhails of arrows in seconds, felling many Uruk-hai. Despite their fine\nbowmanship, and the weight of fire being put out by the human and elf\ndefenders, the Uruk hordes moved steadily closer to the walls. At short\nrange, the Uruk Crossbowmen could finally hit back with their\nslow-loading, yet hard-hitting crossbows, killing several, one falling\nhorribly into the mass of Uruks below. Then the Uruk-hai began raising\nladders, each with a berserker on top. Many elves were killed during\nthis stage of the battle as the pressure increased. Despite that, they\nand the Rohirrim had managed to keep the Uruk-hai from getting a\nfoothold on the wall. While the elves were sword-fighting with the\nUruk-hai on the wall, the sappers, a group of four Uruk-hai, laid the\ncharges that were prepared by Saruman in the culvert under the wall. A\nberserker lit the blasting powder despite Legolas' repeated attempts to\nbring him down. The ensuing explosion sent Uruks, Elves, and huge chunks\nof rock high into the air. The falling debris brought great casualties\nto both sides of the conflict.\n\nOnce the wall was blown, the Uruk-hai poured into Helm's Deep through\nthe large gap that was made from the explosion, while another group of\nUruk-hai brought a wooden battering ram to the main gate and attempted\nto break it. Aragorn, having been thrown from the wall in the explosion,\nlay dazed right in the path of the advancing Uruk-Hai. Gimli leaped from\nthe wall amongst the enemy, forcing them to deal with the dwarf in their\nmidst. This bought Aragorn time to regain his senses and rally the\nremaining elves for a counter charge. The elves, despite being\noutnumbered, managed to stem the tide. Soon afterwards Aragorn, Gimli,\nand the elves were forced to retreat as the battle became more\ndesperate; Haldir, still fighting on the wall, was slain by two Uruk-hai\nbefore Aragorn's eyes. Aragorn rushed to his side, but he was too late.\n\nThe Uruk-hai shot grappling lines onto the walls and used them to anchor\nmassive ladders that carried dozens of Uruk-hai up to the main Hornburg\nwalls. Although Legolas shot one down, many more sprung up. At the main\ngate, the Uruk-hai had broken a hole into the wood of the gate and\nengaged the Rohan soldiers in a vicious struggle. King Theoden was\ninjured in this fight, but was able to fall back to a safer place to\nrecover. Théoden, when asked what he needed by Aragorn, requested\n''“Time, as much you can get me.” ''To do this, Aragorn and Gimli\nsneaked out the back of the fortress. To reach the crowd of Uruk-hai,\nthey had to cross a wide gap, which Aragorn had to throw Gimli across.\nBefore he was thrown Gimli said _“Don't tell the Elf”_, referring to\nLegolas and what he was likely to say about the incident. Aragorn and\nGimli managed to buy enough time for the Rohirrim to brace the door,\nthough it did little to slow the enemy's advance. Despite fighting\nferociously, the Rohirrim defenders were cut down quickly by the\noverwhelming Uruk numbers. With Helm's Deep being quickly overrun,\nTheoden ordered a retreat to the keep. Aragorn and Gimli, trapped\noutside the gate, were able to scale the wall up to the Hornburg, via a\nrope cast down to them by Legolas. During the retreat, many Rohirrim\nwere killed.\n\nOnce inside the keep, Théoden fell into despair while his men tried to\nbrace the door. Aragorn sent word to evacuate the caves.\n\nAt this point, Gimli noted that the sun was rising, and Aragorn\nremembered Gandalf telling him that he would arrive at dawn on the fifth\nday, and convinced Théoden to ride out with him. Gimli sounded the horn\nof Helm Hammerhand and what remained of the Rohirrim (amounting to\nbarely nearly 10), along with Aragorn and Legolas, mounted on their\nhorses and charged the Uruks just as they broke through the door, at the\ncommand of '''Forth Eorlingas'. ''Théoden's cavalry drove out all of the\norcs from the Hornburg, killing and knocking out hundreds of Uruks and\nbroke through the gate and the causeway, with Saruman's main host now\ngathered outside the fortress.\n\nOutside the keep, Théoden and Aragorn saw Gandalf arrive on Shadowfax.\nAlongside him was Éomer and his cavalry, and together they charged down\nthe valley. The Uruk-hai formed up a phalanx of spears to repel Eomer’s\nhorsemen; however, the Rohirrim charged down with the sun behind them,\nand the Uruk-hai defense was thrown into disarray when the sun crested\nthe hill and blinded them. Between the combined forces, the Uruk-hai\nwere forced to retreat.\n\nIn the extended edition, the remaining Uruks were driven into a Huorn\nforest that had appeared out of nowhere, and Éomer ordered his men to\nstop pursuing them. The Rohirrim watched from a safe distance as the\nHuorns slaughter the remaining Uruk-hai.\n\nIn the extended edition DVD, after the battle, Gimli is sitting on a\ncorpse nearby the gate and Legolas walks up to him, saying he killed\nforty-two Uruk-Hai, while Gimli responds by saying he was on\nforty-three. Legolas shoots the corpse Gimli is sitting on, startling\nGimli, and says he now has forty-three because the corpse was twitching.\nGimli insists the corpse was already dead, and that it was twitching\nbecause his axe was embedded in its nervous system. He proves his point\nby jerking the axe shaft twice, causing the corpse to twitch twice as\nwell.\n\nElves of Lórien\n\n The\nelves' involvement in the defense of the Hornburg proved critical in\ndelaying the enemy; as their superior archery and sword skills enabled\nthem to defend the Deeping Wall for a time. Around 400 Galadhrim\nWarriors marched to defend the Hornburg. Otherwise, the Rohirrim did not\nhave sufficient manpower to cover all of the Hornburg's fortifications\nand hold out long enough, being forced to supplant their ranks with\nteenage boys and old men. The elves' sacrifice bought enough time for\nGandalf, Eomer and the two thousand mounted Rohirrim horseman to arrive\nand turn the tide of the battle.\n\nBut the price that the elves paid was high indeed: most of them who left\nLothlórien including Haldir were slain in the battle. They were buried\nby the men of Rohan with honor in the land of their allies.\n\nIt is notable that the Elves are sent only in the film. The Two Towers\nhas no reference whatsoever to Elves being sent by Elrond and Galadriel\nfor the battle. It was made purely for the film, which has been known to\nanger many “Tolkien purists”.\n\n\nNotable deaths\n\n-   Háma, Doorward of Meduseld"

    "text": "For the latter half of the Third Age, the LONELY MOUNTAIN was the\ngreatest city in Middle-earth.\n\nIt was located in northeast of Rhovanion, and was the source of the\nRiver Running.\n\nThe mountain was named “EREBOR” in Sindarin.\n\n\nHistory\n\nYears of the Trees and First Age\n\nThe Dwarves of Durin's Folk discovered mineral wealth of the Lonely\nMountain sometime after the awakening of the first Durin. A mining\ncolony was soon set up and a road was laid out to connect the Dwarves to\ntheir great cities from the Iron Hills and as far west as their realms\nand possessions in the Blue Mountains.\n\nSecond and Third Ages\n\nIn the Beginning\n\nThe Dwarves have lived and mined in the mountain during the Second Age,\nbut it wasn't until the mid-Third Age that the colony had become a\nfirmly established Kingdom of the Longbeards, after the fall of the\nancient Kingdom of Khazad-dûm due to the awakening of a Balrog (who was\nlater known as Durin's Bane) in TA 1981. The survivors under Thráin I\nfollowed him to the Lonely Mountain and the colony became the ancestral\nhome of the King under the Mountain. By TA 1999, it had become a Dwarven\nstronghold, where the Dwarves became a numerous and prosperous people.\nIn this time, the Dwarves became very rich and amassed a large amount of\ngold and treasure which included the jewel known as the Arkenstone.\nThrain I used the Arkenstone as a symbol of his rule, and his sons and\ngrandsons under him who were to follow.\n\nFor two-hundred and eleven years the kingdom advanced, expanded,\nprospered, and endured until Thorin I abandoned it to join his kin in\nthe Grey Mountains, and the Lonely Mountain was abandoned for\nthree-hundred and eighty years. However, the Dwarves of the Grey\nMountains began experiencing attacks by the dragons that still lived in\nthose mountains, and became embroiled in a costly war against them,\nforcing the Dwarves to abandon the Grey Mountains in TA 2590. The\nDwarves went their separate ways with Grór and his followers settling in\nthe Iron Hills and Thrór and his followers settling in the Lonely\nMountain.\n\nUnder Siege\n\nWhile Thorin Oakenshield was out hunting one day in TA 2770, Smaug came\nfrom the mountains and invaded the Lonely Mountain, hoarding all its\nwealth for himself. Thráin II and several companions escaped by a secret\ndoor. For many years thereafter the Dwarves lived in exile in the Blue\nMountains until, by a seemingly chance meeting, Gandalf the Grey met\nThorin Oakenshield and together they planned to reclaim the mountain.\nThis is told in detail in _The Quest of Erebor_ and described by\nTolkien's song, “Far Over the Misty Mountains Cold”.\n\nThe Quest of Erebor\n\n\n\nIn TA 2941, Bilbo Baggins and Thorin's company traveled to the Lonely\nMountain to regain the treasure Smaug had stolen. Set into the side of\nthe mountain was a secret door, five feet high and wide enough for three\nto walk through abreast. Gandalf had managed to obtain the door's key,\nwhich fit a key hole which could be found only when the setting sun and\nthe last moon of autumn (also known as Durin's Day) were in the sky\nwould the light shine upon the keyhole. As told by Tolkien in The\nHobbit, it took many days to find the door, and luckily for Thorin and\nCompany they did not arrive on Durin's day so they had plenty of time to\nenter the mountain.\n\nSmaug was eventually slain, shot out of the sky by a well-aimed arrow to\nhis only weak spot by Bard the Bowman, a man of Laketown,he was a\ndescendant of the king of Dale Girion, who later became king of the Men\nin the area known as Dale adjoining the Lonely Mountain. Thorin thus\nreclaimed the mountain, but the Elves of Mirkwood and Men of Lake-town\nclaimed a part of the treasure, which Thorin refused to share. Dáin II\nIronfoot came to the aid of his cousin Thorin, and the three Free\nPeoples almost did battle with one another, but then Orcs attacked and\nthe Dwarves, elves, and men joined ranks together with the eagles\nagainst the Orcs, in what became known as the Battle of the Five Armies.\nDuring the battle Thorin was mortally injured, and the titles King under\nthe Mountain and King of Durin's Folk passed to Dáin.\n\nWar of the Ring\n\nBattle of Dale\n\n The demise of Smaug was not\nto be the last of Lonely Mountain's many troubles. In TA 3019 on the\n17th of March, a horde of Easterling soldiers from Rhûn swarmed over the\nRedwater river, opening up a second front in the northern theater of the\nWar of the Ring. The sheer force of the feared and renowned Easterlings\ncrushed the Men of Dale and routed their forces, which had to rally back\nto the protection of the Lonely Mountain.  The Dwarves and Men fought a pitched\nbattle against the invaders, in which King Dain and The king of Dale at\nthe time were killed, eventually emerging victorious over their\nopponents. The impenetrable gates and walls of the Lonely Mountain,\nfurnished and extensively worked with advanced, complex and intricate\nDwarven stonework, defense planning and smith-work, easily withstood the\nsiege equipment of the Easterlings. The Lonely Mountain itself was a key\nstrong-point and gave its defenders great tactical leverage against the\nattackers, being able to shoot arrows and fling stones down below in\nreprisal. The many years invested in improving the Lonely  Mountain's defences had paid\noff, and the defenders outlasted the Easterlings in the siege. The\nEasterlings then withdrew, suffering disproportionate casualties because\nof their botched campaign and their difficulty in combating the Dwarven\ntechnology, weapons, armor and defenses.\n\nFourth Age\n\nThe Lonely Mountain was a site of battle during the War of the Ring.\nDáin was killed during the War of the Ring, and was succeeded by his son\nThorin III Stonehelm, who ruled well into the Fourth Age. During this\ntime, Dwarves from the Lonely Mountain helped rebuild cities in Gondor\nand the fortress of Helm's Deep, and some went to the newly established\nDwarven colony in the Glittering Caves where Gimli was lord.\n\n\nPortrayals in adaptations\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\nPeter Jackson's _The Hobbit_ trilogy (2012-2014) featured\ncomputer-generated shots of the Lonely Mountain, Dale, and other Dwarven\ncities."

    "text": "The BAGGINS FAMILY is a prominent, respectable, and wealthy family of\nHobbits that lived in the Shire.\n\nThe Baggins family lives in the Shire, mostly in or near the town of\nHobbiton, hence they were often referred to as the family “BAGGINS OF\nHOBBITON”. They were seen as respectable until Bilbo Baggins set out on\nthe quest for Erebor with Gandalf the Grey and thirteen Dwarves: when he\nreturned he was seen as odd or queer, but also extremely rich.\n\nBilbo adopted his “nephew” Frodo Baggins, who inherited the _smial_ of\nBag End after Bilbo left. Frodo himself was involved in the quest of the\nLord of the Rings, which ended the War of the Ring.\n\nThe Baggins clan traces their origin to the first recorded Baggins, one\n_Balbo Baggins_, who was born in or near Hobbiton in 1167 of the Shire\nreckoning (2767 Third Age). Bilbo is a great-grandson of Balbo, as was\nFrodo's father Drogo.\n\nAfter Bilbo and Frodo left the only recorded Bagginses are the\ndescendants of Bilbo's great-nephew _Posco Baggins_, although many other\ndescendants of Balbo Baggins are also recorded, under the\n_Sackville-Bagginses_, as well as Peregrin Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck\n(through various interfamiliary marriages).\n\nThe name Baggins is a translation in English of the actual Westron name\n_Labingi_, which was believed to be related to the Westron word _labin_,\n“bag”.\n\n\nList of Bagginses\n\nNotable Bagginses\n\n  \n\n-   ANGELICA BAGGINS (born TA 2981) the daughter of PONTO BAGGINS.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BALBO BAGGINS (TA 2767 - TA 2863) is the first recorded Baggins, and\n    the ancestor of the Baggins family of Hobbiton. He married Berylla\n    Boffin and had five children: Mungo, Pansy, Ponto, Largo, and Lily.\n\n        _Note on Balbo's dates_: In the published Baggins genealogy,\n        only Balbo's birthdate is shown, but by looking at his children,\n        it is possible to estimate his deathdate.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   MUNGO BAGGINS (TA 2807- TA 2900) was the grandfather of BILBO\n    BAGGINS. Mungo was the eldest son of BALBO BAGGINS and BERYLLA\n    BOFFIN BAGGINS. Mungo had four younger siblings: PANSY, PONTO,\n    LARGO, and LILY. Mungo married LAURA GRUBB and had five children.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BUNGO BAGGINS (TA 2846 - TA 2926) was the father of Bilbo. He was\n    also the builder of Bag End. He and his wife Belladonna (née Took)\n    lived there until the end of their days. He had a brother named\n    BINGO.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BILBO BAGGINS (TA 2890 - ?) first Baggins to have a great adventure.\n    He became extremely wealthy, and was quite eccentric: known as “Mad\n    Baggins”.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   FRODO BAGGINS (TA 2968 - ?) nephew and heir of Bilbo, he was\n    instrumental in the war of the Ring, and was able to destroy the One\n    Ring with the aid of Samwise Gamgee and Gollum.\n\nOther Bagginses\n\n-   ROSA BAGGINS (TA 2856 - ?) was an ancestor of both MERRY and PIPPIN.\n    Rosa was the daughter of PONTO BAGGINS and Mimosa Bunce. She had a\n    younger brother, Polo. Her husband was _Hildigrim Took_ (TA 2840 -\n    TA 2941), one of the many sons of the OLD TOOK.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   LAURA (GRUBB) BAGGINS (TA 2814 - TA 2916) was the grandmother of\n    Bilbo Baggins. She was the wife of Mungo Baggins. Besides Bungo, she\n    had four other children; BELBA (TA 2856 - TA 2956), LONGO (TA 2860-\n    TA 2950), Linda, and BINGO (TA 2864 - TA 2963). Upon the death of\n    her husband, she became Head of the Family. She died and was\n    succeeded by her eldest son, BUNGO.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   LINDA BAGGINS (TA 2862 - TA 2963) was the sister of BUNGO BAGGINS.\n    She married BODO PROUDFOOT, and had a son named ODO (TA 2904 - TA\n    3005). Linda was also an aunt of Bilbo Baggins.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   PRIMULA BRANDYBUCK BAGGINS (TA 2920 - TA 2980) was a daughter of\n    Gorbadoc Brandybuck, Master of Buckland, and Mirabella Took, the\n    youngest daughter of the Old Took. She married DROGO BAGGINS, and\n    had one child, Frodo. In 2980, both she and Drogo drowned in the\n    Baranduin, leaving Frodo orphaned.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   DAISY (BAGGINS) BOFFIN (TA 2950 - ?) was a cousin of Frodo Baggins.\n    She was the daughter of Drogo's brother DUDO (TA 2911 - TA 3009).\n    She married GRIFFO BOFFIN.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   BINGO BAGGINS (TA 2864 - TA 2960), the brother of Bungo (see above),\n    married Chica Chubb; they had one son, FALCO CHUBB-BAGGINS. Falco is\n    most notable as Bilbo's cousin.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   POLO BAGGINS, son of Ponto Baggins and Mimosa Bunce, brother of Rosa\n    Baggins (see above), had two children, Posco and Prisca Baggins.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   FOSCO BAGGINS was the paternal grandfather of Frodo Baggins.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Cathell Baggins was very tall for a hobbit.\n-   Drogo Baggins was the father of Frodo Baggins .\n\n\nSackville-Baggins family\n\nThe SACKVILLE-BAGGINS family was founded by the marriage of _Longo\nBaggins_ to _Camellia Sackville_, heiress of the Sackville family\nheadship. Their son, _Otho Sackville-Baggins_, adopted a double name,\nkept by his wife _Lobelia_ (née Bracegirdle). They had a son Lotho, who\nwas murdered. At Lobelia's death, the brief-lived family disappeared.\n\n-   OTHO SACKVILLE-BAGGINS (TA 2910 - TA 3012) adopted the name of both\n    his parents, effectively founding a new family. His and his son\n    Lotho's ambition was to succeed Bilbo (and later Frodo) as head of\n    the Baggins family; had that happened, Lotho would have called\n    himself 'Baggins-Sackville-Baggins.'\n\n&nbsp;\n-   LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS (TA 2918 - TA 3020) married Otho, and had\n    a son, Lotho. Lobelia had tried to claim Bag End together with Otho\n    during Bilbo's disappearance, but could only move in when Frodo sold\n    it to her. Much of Bilbo's silverware vanished during his\n    disappearance; when Bilbo left the Shire permanently, he gave\n    Lobelia a box of silver spoons labeled “For Lobelia, from Cousin\n    Bilbo, as a present.” During the War of the Ring, she opposed\n    Saruman, and was imprisoned. Freed after the Scouring of the Shire,\n    Lobelia granted Bag End back to Frodo, and moved back to her\n    original family, She died in 3020, and she was over 100 years old.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   LOTHO SACKVILLE-BAGGINS (TA 2964 - TA 3019), nicknamed “Pimple”,\n    became an accomplice of Saruman during the War of the Ring. Trading\n    pipe-weed with Saruman for money, he began buying land in the\n    Southfarthing, where Men from Isengard were stationed. With the aid\n    of these Ruffians, Lotho was able to depose and imprison Will\n    Whitfoot, the Shire's lawful mayor, and declared himself Chief\n    Shirriff. Under his command the Shire was industrialised. Lotho\n    began to call himself THE BOSS. However, Lotho was soon stripped of\n    his power, and Saruman took over. Saruman's servant Gríma Wormtongue\n    killed Lotho, and either buried Lotho or ate him.\n\nThe name Sackville was a familiar “aristocratic” name in Tolkien's day,\nespecially in double-barrelled names such as Sackville-West, and he\npresumably used it (and the contrast with the more mundane Baggins) to\nimply the somewhat snobbish nature of the Sackville-Bagginses. Notes in\nthe guide for translators of the LotR show Tolkien also had the\n“sack”/“bag” connection in mind, which is kept in most translations,\ne.g. in Dutch the name becomes _Buul-Balings_, “buul” and “baal” both\nbeing words for sack or bag.\n\n\nPortrayal in Adaptations\n\nTranslation Around the World\n\nThe name Baggins is translated in most translations of The Hobbit and\nThe Lord of the Rings, often keeping the “bag” or 'sack' meaning:\n\n  Foreign Language       Translated name\n  ---------------------- -----------------\n  German                 Beutlin\n  Dutch                  Balings\n  French                 Sacquet\n  Norwegian              Lommelun\n  Finnish                Reppuli\n  Spanish                Bolsón\n  Brazilian Portuguese   Bolseiro\n  Swedish                Secker\n  Swedish (Ancient)      Bagger\n  Hungarian              Zsákos\n  Danish                 Sækker\n  Czech                  Pytlík\n  Slovak                 Bublík\n  Slovak (Ancient)       Lazník\n  Chinese (Hong Kong)    巴金斯\n  Asturian               Bolsona\n\nde:Beutlin it:Famiglia Baggins pl:Bagginsowie"

    "text": "YAVANNA (Quenya; IPA: - “Giver of Fruits”) was of the Ainur and Valar,\nand one of the Aratar who was responsible for the growth of all the\nfruits and growing things of Arda. She was also called KEMENTÁRI\n(Quenya; IPA: “Queen of the Earth”), IVON (Sindarin; IPA: “Giver of\nFruits”). She resided in the Pastures of Yavanna, in the south of\nValinor.\n\nShe is the wife of Aulë, older sister of Vána , and kin to Melian.\n\n\nBiography\n\nBeginning in the Years of the Lamps during the Spring of Arda, she\nplanted and caused to grow the first growing things of the world (trees\nand plants), which she had long prepared. At first, just as every other\nthing in the world that the Valar nurtured and cared for, these things\nprospered and thrived for a time. Melkor, however, had his own plans and\nthey involved taking the world from his brethren and ruling it for\nhimself. From his great fortress of Utumno in the far north, he sent\nforth his poisons into the veins of the world blighting the Spring of\nArda. Then the things of Yavanna fell sick and rotted and soon after\nMelkor assaulted and destroyed the Two Lamps, breaking the world.\n\nAfterwards, the Valar relocated to the continent of Aman where they\ncreated the Two Trees - the only light in the whole world at that time.\nMiddle-earth was left in darkness, and the living things that survived\nwere put into a great sleep by Yavanna until the rise of the Sun and the\nMoon many thousands of years later.\n\nAfter Eru allowed Aulë's creations, the Dwarves, to survive, Yavanna\nfeared that they would cut down all the trees in Middle-earth. Eru\nanswered her plea by creating Ents to protect the trees.\n\nIn the Song of the Ainur, Yavanna sang of branches of great trees that\nwould receive the rain of Manwë and Ulmo, and some trees sang\nto Ilúvatar. This is said to be the conception of the Shepherds of the\nTrees. Her thought also met with Manwe's, setting the arrival of\nthe Great Eagles.\n\nIn the beginning of days, Yavanna planted the first seeds of Arda and\nwatched over the Olvar and all growing things. As Morgoth was corrupting\nher beloved creatures, she contended with him and supported all the\nplans against him. After his expulsion from Arda she planted the seeds\nthat she had long devised and life came to Middle-earth during\nthe Spring of Arda, although in the beginning no flowers bloomed. When\nthe Two Lamps were destroyed much of the life on Middle-earth slumbered\nin the Sleep of Yavanna that lasted until the rising of the Moon and\nthe Sun.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Two Lamps the Valar withdrew to Aman and\ncreated Valinor. Upon the green mound of Ezellohar, Yavanna sat and sang\nwhile the other Valar sat and listened. Her song, with the aid of the\ntears of Nienna brought forth the Two Trees, her greatest creation,\nwhich gave light to the land. However, Yavanna did not forsake the Outer\nLands; at times she would come there and heal the hurts of Morgoth and\nurged the other Valar to wage war on him before the Awakening of the\nElves.\n\nAfter Eru allowed Aulë's creations, the Dwarves, to survive, Yavanna\nfeared that they would cut down all the trees in Middle-earth. Aulë, in\nreply, told her that even Elves and Men, the true Children of\nIlúvatar would have need of her trees as well. Yavanna lamented\nto Manwë, questioning whether anything she had made would be free from\nthe dominion of others. Manwë brought her concerns before Ilúvatar in\nprayer, and Eru did indeed have pity upon Yavanna: He answered her plea\nby creating the Ents to protect the trees.\n\nWhen the Elves built Tirion upon Tol Eressëa Yavanna fashioned the\ntree Galathilion, a lesser image of Telperion, for the court beneath\nthe Mindon.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Two Trees Yavanna examined their remains\nand told the other Valar that if she could use the light of\nthe Silmarils she could heal them. This light she was denied by the will\nof Fëanor. Doing what she and Nienna could, they managed to bring\nforth one silver flower from Telperion and one golden fruit\nfrom Laurelin. She gave these to her husband Aulë, who fashioned vessels\nfor them and thus created the Moon and the Sun.\n\nFor the Men who had stood with the Valar in the War of Wrath the land\nof Andor was raised by Ossë, established by Aulë, and enriched by\nYavanna. When the Edain came to this island they created the realm\nof Númenor. In the later centuries, when the Valar decided to\nsend emissaries to the mortal lands, Yavanna begged the Maia Curumo to\ntake her servant, Aiwendil, with him.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Quenya, _Yavanna_ means “Giver of Fruits”, from _yáve_ (“fruit”)\nand _anna_ (“gift”). KEMENTÁRI, her epithet, means “Queen of the\nEarth”, from _kemen_ (“the Earth”) and _tari_ (“Queen”).\n\nHer name in Sindarin is IVON, the “Giver of Fruits”. It is only attested\nin the compound _Ivonwin_(“Maidens of Yavanna”). The month\n_Ivanneth_ may have been named after Yavanna.\n\nEarlier names\n\n_PALÚRIEN_ was an earlier name for Yavanna. It means “Lady of the Wide\nEarth.”\n\n\nTrivia\n\n-   Yavanna could possibly be related to Aragorn, as she is said to be\n    kin of Melian, who is Aragorn's distant ancestor. Yavanna's possible\n    relation to Melian could result in her relation to many other\n    characters, such as Elros, Elrond, and Arwen.\n-   She is ranked fourth among the Aratar (eight most powerful of the\n    Valar) and second among the Valier (ladies of the Valar).\n-   Instead of Yavanna, in a few other versions, it was her sister Vána\n    that made Laurelin bear its last fruit.\n\n\nMaiar of Yavanna\n\nAiwendil (Radagast), is the third wizard sent to help the people of\nMiddle-earth stand against Sauron.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn early writings, Oromë was the son of Aulë and Yavanna.\n\nAs Palúrien, she was once the sister of Varda and Vána.\n\n\nGallery"

    "text": "_For other uses of TREEBEARD see Treebeard (disambiguation)_\n\nTREEBEARD, also known as FANGORN, was the oldest of the Entsleft in\nMiddle-earth, an ancient tree-like being who is a “shepherd of trees”.\nHe has a very tall and stiff-limbed appearance, with bark-like skin and\nleafy hair.\n\nIn Chapter 5 of _The Two Towers_, Gandalf calls Treebeard “...the oldest\nliving thing that still walks beneath the Sun upon this Middle-earth.”\nIn _The Return of the King_, chapter 6, “Many Partings”, Celeborn\naddresses Treebeard as “Eldest.”\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the Third Age\n\nTreebeard was the oldest Ent who ever lived. He was so old that he\nremembered the time of Elves teaching the trees to speak, recalling how\nthey wanted to talk to everything. In the time when Middle-earth was\nmerely a giant forest, Treebeard roamed the land, presumably with his\nlove, Fimbrethil. But after the loss of the Entwives, he and the\nremaining Ents dwelt in the Forest of Fangorn, isolating themselves from\nthe outside world.\n\nThird Age and War of the Ring\n\n\n\nWith the arrival of the Istari in the year TA 1000 of the Third Age,\nSaruman came to Fangorn and befriended Treebeard, and would often visit\nhim. The two would talk, discussing various subjects, with Saruman\ngathering information about the forest itself, and in particular its\nintertwining paths.\n\nAs the years passed and with no Entings due to the loss of the Entwives,\nthe number of Ents fell. Some Ents in their old age became still and\nsilent, almost becoming tree like as they slumbered. Treebeard, Finglas,\nFladrif, Quickbeam and around fifty remained, some younger, some older.\nWhen Sauron's shadow began to spread across the land once more,\nTreebeard and the Ents remained in Fangorn, continuing to tend the\ntrees, and taking no part in the affairs of Men, Elves and Wizards.\nHowever, they were brought into the war when Meriadoc Brandybuck and\nPeregrin Took escaped from Saruman's Orcs, became lost in Fangorn Forest\nand befriended Treebeard. Upon learning that Saruman was cutting down\nthe forest to power his war effort, an angry Treebeard called all the\nents together for an Entmoot. After three days of deliberation, they\ndecided to attack Isengard, in an event known as the Last March of the\nEnts.\n\nLeading the attack, Treebeard helped to bring down Isengard's walls and\nutterly destroy them, save the tower of Orthanc and Saruman himself who\nsat in his tower with his manservant Grima Wormtongue. The Ents also\nbroke the dam wall which had starved the once green and beautiful\nWizards Vale of all its water, flooding Saruman's pits, mines, and\nmachines of war. Once Isengard was cleansed, Treebeard remained to guard\nover Saruman, but was ultimately unable to keep him, due to the power of\nSaruman's voice and the fact that Treebeard could not bear to lock any\nliving thing up.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring and Beyond\n\nAfter Aragorn was crowned king, he promised Treebeard that the Ents\ncould prosper again and spread to new lands with the threat of Mordor\ngone, and renew their search for the Entwives.  However, Treebeard sadly\nlamented that forests may spread once more, but the Ents would not,\npredicting that the few remaining Ents would remain in Fangorn forest\nuntil they slowly dwindled in number.  However, he still held some hope\nfor finding the Entwives, as he asked Merry and Pippin to watch for them\nnear the Shire, and to bring word if they were to find them.\n\nTreebeard's ultimate fate is not known.  While he aged very slowly and\nwas extremely long-lived, he was not immortal.  He most likely underwent\nthe same fate of all the Ents: eventually settling down in one place,\ngrowing roots and leaves, and essentially becoming a tree himself,\nceasing conscious thought.\n\nIn her final words to Treebeard during their parting at Isengard,\nGaladriel says she will “Not  in Middle-earth, nor until the\nlands that lie under the wave are lifted up again.  Then in the\nwillow-meads of Nan-tathren we may meet in the spring.  Farewell!” This\nsuggests that in the future, perhaps after the Dagor Dagorath, when the\nlands of Beleriand will be recovered again, Treebeard and, possibly all\nthe other Ents, will awaken again and that he will meet her again in\nNan-Tathren.\n\n\n\n\nAppearance in adaptations\n\nPeter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy\n\nIn Peter Jackson's films _The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers_ (2002)\nand _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_ (2003), Treebeard is\na combination of a large animatronic model and a CGI construct; his\nvoice is performed by John Rhys-Davies, who also plays Gimli.\n\nIn the movie _The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers_ (2002), the Ents at\nthe Entmoot initially decline Merry and Pippin's request for help.\nTreebeard is carrying the hobbits through the forest, when Pippin gets\nan idea. He asks Treebeard to carry them towards Isengard, because that\nis the last place Saruman would look for them. When Treebeard gets close\nto the forest's edge, he sees the devastation wrought by Saruman's orcs.\nThe trees have all been chopped down to serve as fuel for Saruman's war\nmachine. Treebeard then makes a momentous decision, and calls for the\nother Ents. They attack Isengard and manage to flood it. In the book,\nTreebeard and the Ents decide to attack Saruman without any such\ncoercion. They were already most likely aware of this situation.  When\nGandalf arrives at Isengard in _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the\nKing_ (2003), Treebeard refers to Gandalf as “young master Gandalf”.\n\nVideo games\n\nTreebeard is featured in _The Lord of the Rings: Conquest_ in both the\ngood and evil campaigns. In the first he appears in the Battle of\nIsengard level, where the player must deliver Gríma Wormtongue's key to\nOrthanc to him. In the second, an alternate timeline in which Frodo took\nthe One Ring for himself sees Treebeard killed by the Balrog known as\nDurin's Bane.\n\nHe also appears in LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game, in which\nhe is a playable character when one of the Hobbits is riding on his\nshoulder.\n\n\nTrivia\n\n-   It's believed that many of Treebeard's mannerisms were based on\n    Tolkien's friend C.S. Lewis, a loud, bombastic man known for his\n    powerful stride and overwhelming presence.\n-   The Top Trumps card game lists Treebeard as being 17,051 years old.\n\n\nAppearances\n\n-   The Two Towers (film)\n-   The Return of the King (film)"

    "title": "Shelob",
    "page_id": "497",
    "text": "SHELOB was a Great Spider, that was the greatest offspring of Ungoliant,\nthe primordial spider. During the Third Age she lived in Mordor and was\nknown to feed indiscriminately, preying on the inhabitants. She was\nencountered by Frodo and Sam in their quest to destroy the One Ring.\nShelob's early history is completely unknown, save for the assumption\nthat she was born in the Ered Gorgoroth and that she was the “last\nchild” of Ungoliant. By the Second Age, she often feasted on her own\nchildren, and that at some point after fleeing from Beleriand, yet long\nbefore Sauron took the land of Mordor for himself she spun a dark lair\nin the Ephel Duath (Mountains of Shadow), near Cirith Ungol in the\npasses above Minas Morgul. For hundreds of years, she resided there\nmaking a labyrinth of webs within a network of caves to better trap her\nprey, which included all creatures great and small. She feasted\nprimarily on those who wandered into her webs, though if a particularly\njuicy morsel was available, she would silently pursue and kill it.\n\nSauron was aware of Shelob's presence in the mountains and allowed her\nto dwell there, for she made an excellent, if incidental, guard for the\npassage of Cirith Ungol. Sauron was known to be somewhat fond of her,\nand in a rare show of humor, was even known to refer to her as his cat.\nSauron would sometimes give her food in the form of prisoners that he\nhad no more use for or servants who had displeased him. Reports of the\nmassacre made by Shelob would be carried back to Barad-dur to further\nplease the Dark Lord's humor. She would also sometimes eat Orcs that\nmanned the tower of Cirith Ungol. However, as she was a more effective\nguard for the pass than they, Sauron never made any serious attempt to\nstop her (though Orcs would occasionally try to barricade her lair with\nstones).\n\nAt one point after being set free from Mordor, Gollum stumbled into her\nlair while attempting to escape the barren country. She caught him, but\nhe survived the encounter by promising to bring her tastier meats than\nhe. Orcs of Cirith Ungol had seen him on several occasions and\nbelieved that he was too thin and wiry for Shelob to bother eating.\n\nGollum would attempt later to fulfill this promise by leading Frodo and\nSam into her lair and abandoning them. His hope was that once Shelob\nfinished consuming the two hobbits, she would throw away the Ring with\nthe other parts of the hobbits that she could not eat, allowing Gollum\nto retrieve it. The two hobbits eventually happened upon a passageway\nthat was too choked with Shelob's dark cobwebs to proceed, but as\nfortune would have it, Frodo's sword Sting, being of Elvish make, was\nable to slice through them. Using the Phial of Galadriel, they managed\nto fend her off the first time. Earendil's Star the Light from the\nPhial, caused unbearable stabbing pain to Shelob's darkened senses, but\nshe returned to attack Frodo poisoning him with her stinger in a\nsurprise attack just as they had reached the exit of the cave on the\nMordor side.\n\nSam then assaulted the creature using Sting in order to save his master,\nwho lay poisoned after Shelob's surprise attack. In a pitched battle,\nSam managed to stab one of her great eyes, injuring her leg, and pierce\nher great belly, the most grievous wound. Sam was lucky indeed as Shelob\ncaused this wound herself, when she tried to stab him with the venomous\nstinger in the underside of her abdomen. None had ever wounded her so\nbadly before.\n\nIt is not known if Shelob recovered from the battle, or if she succumbed\nto her wounds, as the book specifies that her fate will remain unknown\nto the people of Middle-earth. The last time she is mentioned is when\nSam wears the one ring, and hears Shelob “bubbling” in her misery far\naway, as his sense of hearing is vastly improved by wearing the Ring.\n\nWhile Shelob's ultimate fate was unknown, her offspring (which were\nlucky enough to escape her hunger) continued to produce new generations\nof spiders. Nests of these spiders are known to have existed in\nMirkwood.\n\n\nCharacter\n\nLike most spiders, Shelob had spindly legs, multiple eyes, and venomous\nchelicerae. She usually immobilized her prey with her paralyzing sting\nthat enabled her to feed on her victims at her leisure, but could also\ncrush her prey to death by swiftly dropping on them. Her head was\nCris-crossed with scars and she had a number of missing eyes. The Orcs\ncomment she usually would paralyze her victims and trap them in webs,\nkeeping them alive for some time before killing them.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nRalph Bakshi version\n\nGollum gives an indirect mention of Shelob near the end of the film,\nsaying that “she might help us...”, but she doesn't appear.\n\nRankin/Bass\n\nShelob doesn't appear nor is she mentioned in Jules Bass and Arthur\nRankin Jr's 1980 animated film.\n\nLord of the Rings film trilogy\n\nUnlike in the books, Shelob makes her first appearance in Peter\nJackson's _The Return of the King_, rather than _The Two Towers_,\nbecause (as explained) if she had appeared in _The Two Towers_, there\nwould be very little for Frodo and Sam to do in the final film. In this\nadaptation, Shelob appears as a CGI animated creature, roughly eight\nfeet in length and seventeen feet across.\n\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of War\n\nShelob in _Middle-earth: Shadow of War_ is visible as a human in the\nwraith world. In the game, she has the new ring for quite some time\nwhile giving Talion visions about the fate of Minas Ithil (Minas Morgul)\nand the Ringwraiths. It is also seen in the game that Shelob was working\nwith Sauron during the period he was posing as Annatar, and was implied\nto be his lover before he betrayed her. The mobile version of _Shadow of\nWar_ classifies Shelob as a Maia. However, her actual classification is\nunknown as she is a spawn of Ungoliant, who was not a Valar.  \n\n\nGallery"

    "text": "GLAMDRING (also called the FOE-HAMMER) was a hand-and-a-half sword,\nforged for Turgon, the King of Gondolin during the First Age, and later\nowned by the wizard Gandalf.\n\n\nHistory\n\nGlamdring was used in battle only twice in the First Age; Turgon wielded\nit in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, and in the Fall of Gondolin. For over\n6,000 years it went missing, surviving the War of Wrath, until Gandalf\n(and company) found it (along with _Sting_ and _Orcrist_) in the Troll's\ncave in _The Hobbit_, and claimed it for himself. He continued to use\nGlamdring through the events of _The Lord of the Rings_, and by the end\nit was kept safe in the treasure vault of Minas Tirith.\n\nIt was called '''Beater '''by the Goblins. They called Thorin's weapon,\nOrcrist, “BITER”.\n\nGlamdring was used by Gandalf to slay the Great Goblin and both Gandalf\nand Thorin Oakenshield used “Glamdring” and “Orcrist” to slay Goblins in\nthe Goblin's caves.\n\n\nAppearance\n\n\n\nGlamdring, along with Orcrist its mate, are described in _The Hobbit_ as\nhaving “...beautiful scabbards and jeweled hilts”, and Glamdring was\nreferred to by Elrond as “Foe-hammer that the King of Gondolin once\nwore”. In _Unfinished Tales_, one of the footnotes to the story “Of Tuor\nand his Coming to Gondolin” mentions that the sword of Turgon was\n“...white and gold...in a ruel-bone (ivory) sheath,...” While Glamdring\nis not mentioned by name, it is reasonable to assume that the same sword\nis described.\n\nOften it is forgotten that _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of The Rings_ are\n'historical accounts' written by the Hobbits, Bilbo, Frodo and Samwise.\nAs a linguist and by default an historian of modes, Tolkien would not\nhave been ignorant of the historical devices put place within ancient\ntexts, both mythic and historical, where the specific details of\nimportance are not altered, in this case, the wording and appearance of\nGlamdring, but in fact, for poetic effect, the speaker may change. The\npoetic effect, or adding of depth in this case, is that Turgon was\nElrond's great-grandfather, which to accommodate the significance,\nrequires Gandalf to appear buffoonish, or perhaps to be considered to\nwithhold information which would be far too detailed and ruin the poetic\ndepth later on. This may be a 'meta' literary device employed within the\ntechnical stance that Bilbo is recording his history of events. Of\ncourse this cannot be fully true, as stated above the work with the rest\nof Arda was not to be so intrinsically included, but it may help to see\nit in this light.\n\nLike all High-elven swords, Glamdring was like Orcrist and Sting in that\n“being the work of Elvish smiths in the Elder Days these swords shone\nwith a cold light, if any Orcs were near at hand,” and so warned\ntheir bearers of nearby evil. Glamdring was “bright as blue flame for\ndelight in the killing of the” Great Goblin, but that could have\nreferred to its brightness in that situation; everywhere else in\nTolkien's writings, Glamdring's color when glowing is always described\nas white. \n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _GLAMDRING_ is the Quenya for “Foe-hammer”, from the Ñoldorin\nword _dring_ (“beat, strike”).\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film trilogy\n\n\n\nIn Peter Jackson's films, Glamdring is one of Gandalf's primary weapons,\nthe other being his staff. As mentioned above, it has runes engraved in\nthe Cirth script. Weta Workshop designer Richard Taylor stated that this\nwas done with the intention that Elves put magic inscriptions on the\nblade to strengthen it. This idea is repeated with various other\nweapons, such as Anduril. In the _Hobbit_ trilogy, Gandalf is able to\nrecognise it as a sword of Gondolin, but Elrond identifies it by name.\nThe design of the blade is also different to the Elvish curved swords\nregularly seen, likely because the blade was made in the First Age,\nwhere sword design was different.\n\nWhile it does not glow in the films it is still powerful, especially in\nGandalf's fight with the Balrog. It is strong enough to pierce the\nBalrog's flesh without damage, and can even be used by Gandalf to cast\nspells. Gandalf uses it to summon a bolt of lightning to the blade. The\nblade receives the lightning and stores it, allowing Gandalf to use its\npower to kill the Balrog.\n\nGlamdring is inscribed with runes in the Elven language. In the movies,\nthe runes say “_Turgon Aran Gondolin, Tortha gar a matha Glamdring,\nVegil Glamdring gud daelo. Dam an Glamhoth._” which translates to\n“Turgon, King of Gondolin, wields, has, and holds the sword Glamdring,\nFoe of Morgoth's realm, Hammer of the Orcs.” This inscription, however,\nwas not mentioned in any of J. R. R. Tolkien's writings. All Tolkien\nsays in _The Hobbit_ is that the names of the swords were given in the\nrunes, but nothing else is clearly stated. The invented inscription for\nthe movie sword, however, does sound plausible, since Elrond was able to\nidentify that the sword belonged to Turgon.\n\nOne problem, though, is that the inscription is given in Sindarin, but\nin an essay written late in J. R. R. Tolkien's life, he explicitly\nstates that Turgon had re-established Quenya as the language of his\nhousehold in Gondolin (see _The Peoples of Middle-earth_, pg. 348).\nCuriously, it is mentioned in _The Hobbit_ that Gandalf could not read\nthe runes, but that Elrond could, suggesting they were inscribed not in\nnormal Cirth but in some special mode which Gandalf did not know—or, as\nis more likely, it was at first an inconsistency on Tolkien's part,\nkeeping in mind that _The Hobbit_ had not originally been intended to be\nso closely woven into the Silmarillion legends. Although the inscription\nin the film version is _Lord of the Rings_-era Sindarin and Cirth, the\nElvish languages had certainly changed since Turgon's time, so it may be\nthat since Elrond was a survivor from the First Age, he would have been\nable to read the inscription, whereas Gandalf, who had lived in Aman\nuntil the middle Third Age, was not acquainted with it. This seems\nhighly unlikely though, as Quenya originates as an Elvish language from\nthe Undying lands of Aman and is the mode of speech for the Noldorin\nexiles in Beleriand; which Gandalf would have known in his life as the\nMaia Olorin.\n\n\nReproductions\n\nIn addition to the licensed reproduction sword linked below, Del Tin\nAntiche of Italy made unlicensed interpretations of both Glamdring and\nOrcrist, which were sold through Museum Replicas, Ltd. back in the mid\nto late 1980s. These were very high quality steel and well constructed\n(if quite plain).\n\nAnother rather ornate version of Orcrist created by Greg Hildebrandt was\nissued by Franklin Mint in 1998.\n\nUnited Cutlery currently manufactures an officially licensed replica of\nthe movie prop.

    "title": "Dol Amroth",
    "page_id": "548",
    "text": "DOL AMROTH was a feudal principality which formed part of the Kingdom of\nGondor in the southern reaches of that realm. It was ruled by the Prince\nof Dol Amroth; the banner of the Silver Swan of Dol Amroth flew\nalongside that of the White Tree throughout the Third Age.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nElven refugees from Beleriand settled the area and established an Elven\nsettlement about 50 miles north of the promontory, at Edhellond.\n\nDol Amroth dated back to the late Second Age, when “the Faithful” began\nsettling there. The first Lord of Dol Amroth was Galador, son of Imrazôr\nof the Númenóreans. Imrazôr was the son of Adrahil I, who was already\nknown as the Prince of Belfalas. At some point, Imrazôr moved to the\narea where once was the elven haven of Edhellond. According to\ntradition, there he married Mithrellas, a Silvan Elf of Lórien who had\naccompanied Nimrodel, the beloved of Lórien's king Amroth, on her\njourney towards Edhellond, but had become lost along with her mistress.\nTherefore Galador and his descendants had claim to Elven blood.\n\nAfter Imrazôr's death (Mithrellas' fate is nowhere described, only that\nshe eventually left Imrazôr and Galador), Galador went on to found the\ncity and later the Principality of Dol Amroth. He is counted as its\nfirst Lord. The specific date of its foundation is nowhere recounted.\n\n\n\nThe city of Dol Amroth was built south of Edhellond at the inlet of\nCobas Haven in the Bay of Belfalas. The standard of the city was a\nsilver swan, as seen in the banners carried by the knights from there at\nthe Battle of the Pelennor Fields.\n\nThe lands of Dol Amroth were also known as _DOR-EN-ERNIL_, or 'Lands of\nthe Prince': initially this name was applied to the area of Belfalas\nwhere Adrahil I and Imrazôr lived, but after Galador it was also applied\nto the area of Dol Amroth itself.\n\nImrahil was one of the commanders of the army of Gondor during the War\nof the Ring, and for a while commanded the city of Minas Tirith. After\nthe War he went back to Dol Amroth, remaining a counselor to King\nElessar. He was succeeded by his son Elphir. Imrahil's sister Finduilas\nmarried Denethor II, Steward of Gondor and was the mother of Boromir and\nFaramir. Lothíriel, daughter of Imrahil, married Éomer, the King of\nRohan.\n\n\nPopulation\n\nThe first settlers of the area were Sindar from Beleriand until The\nFaithful from Númenor came to the premonitory. The last Elves left in TA\n1981.\n\nThe people of Dol Amroth were tall, grey-eyed, and dark-haired. They\nwere famous as the most skillful harp players in all of Gondor, and\nplayed at the coronation of Aragorn II. The inhabitants of Dol Amroth\nand in the lands nearby were some of the few people of Gondor who\nspoke Sindarin on a daily basis.\n\nThe southern Dúnedain that settled in Dol Amroth never intermarried with\nso-called “Middle Men” so that as a result, the entire population of Dol\nAmroth consisted of people with pure Dúnedain and Elvish ancestry. The\nprinces of Dol Amroth (House of Dol Amroth) were of high Númenórean and\nElvish descent due to the union of Mithrellas and Imrazôr.

    "text": "THARBAD was a fortified town on the River Greyflood, in the southern\nedge of Eriador in Middle-earth.\n\n\nHistory\n\nSecond Age\n\nTharbad was originally the name given to a ford, high up along the once\ndensely forested banks of the Gwathló, where;\n\n_..the land was almost flat, and the waters became sluggish, tending to\nspread into fenland._ Above Tharbad the river was forked, with both\nbranches having converged from out of _a network of swamps, pools and\neyots, where the only inhabitants were hosts of swans, and many other\nwaterbirds._\n\nIn the early Second Age, this huge fenland north-east of Tharbad, which\nthe elves named 'Nîn-in-Eilph', the 'Swanfleet', entered the southern\npart of the Ñoldorin realm Eregion, and Tharbad is first mentioned in\nthe sixth century of that Age;\n\n_...no records are now left of the later voyages that Aldarion made, but\nit is known that he went much on land as well as sea, and went up the\nRiver Gwathló as far as Tharbad, and there met Galadriel._\n\nSuch early river voyages were made by “hardy explorers” of Númenor, in\n“ships of smaller draught” (UT), but such journeys up the Gwathló\nincreased rapidly after the Númenóreans constructed a small harbour at\nthe river's estuary to exploit the local timber: 'Vinyalondë', 'the New\nHaven'.\n\nBy SA 1695, the Númenóreans were devastating the forests below Tharbad,\nand had been obliged to build forts both at the Haven and along the\nriver, to protect their shipbuilding yards and “great wood-stores” (UT)\nfrom the local population, who were understandably hostile:\n\n_..the Númenóreans treated them as enemies, and became ruthless in their\nfellings, giving no thought to husbandry or replanting._\n\nDespite overrunning all of Eriador in the war which began in that year,\nSauron:\n\n“..had not enough force to spare for any assault upon the forts..”(UT),\nbut late in the war it is recorded that he\n\n_summoned more forces, which were approaching from the south-east, and\nwere indeed in Enedwaith at the Crossing of Tharbad, which was only\nlightly held._\"\n\nWhether Tharbad's defences - which presumably consisted of the most\nnortherly of the Gwathló's river forts - were overcome is uncertain, but\nTharbad did become the site of Battle of the Gwathló, where after having\nhis army caught in the rear by Ciryatur, who had hurried up river from\nLond Daer, “Sauron was routed utterly..”\n\nTharbad is not mentioned in surviving records for more than 1500 years\nafter the war: the whole region was largely ignored by the elves and the\nNúmenóreans following the destruction of Eregion and the forests “and\nthe continued hostility of the surviving natives.”(TPoMe)\n\nThe site of the ford became very important after the founding of Gondor\nand Arnor in SA 3320, however, and saw extensive development;\n\n_In the early days of the kingdoms the most expeditious route from one\nto the other (except for great armaments) was found to be by sea to the\nancient port at the head of the estuary of the Gwathlo and so to the\nriver-port of Tharbad, and thence by the road._\n\nA need had arisen “..to undertake the great works of drainage and\ndyke-building that (would make) a great port on the site where Tharbad\nstood..”\n\nThird Age\n\nTo this end, the ford was deepened to receive seagoing vessels, and the\nmassive fenlands above it were extensively drained, until a much smaller\nSwanfleet was all that remained. Tharbad's new river-port was spanned by\na bridge, the immense labour of which “was shared by the North and South\nKingdoms”, and included “a fortified town and haven about the great\nbridge over the Greyflood..”\n\nThese fortifications around the town were “raised there on great\nearthworks on both sides of the river..” (UT), and 'The Great South\nRoad', which was built at the same time to connect the two nations,\npassed across the bridge via “long causeways that carried the road to it\non either side across the fens..” (UT).\n\nSome things did not change, however: Tharbad was the only settlement of\nNúmenóreans in Enedwaith, because the area beyond the fortified town\n“was of little concern to them, except for the patrolling and upkeep of\nthe Great Royal Road” (UT). Nevertheless, “A considerable garrison of\nsoldiers, mariners and engineers  kept there until the seventeenth\ncentury of the Third Age..” (UT).\n\nFrom about TA 1150, it is incidentally recorded that a tribe of hobbits\nmigrated to the fens above Tharbad, and spread onto the land along the\nCauseway south-east of the town over several centuries, but they left\naround TA 1630;\n\n_..because the land and clime of Eriador, especially in the east,\nworsened and became unfriendly._\n\nTheir departure and the deterioration in the weather occurred around the\ntime of the Great Plague of TA 1636, which almost completely depopulated\nCardolan, one of Arnor's 'successor states' with whom Gondor would have\nshared Tharbad's maintenance. Cardolan's few surviving Dúnedain -\nincluding those in Tharbad - fled west to Arthedain. Gondor too was\ndevastated, and in the years following the Plague, traffic along the\nroad through Tharbad declined considerably, as “many parts of Eriador\n(had become) desolate.” (LR): little wonder that “from then onwards, the\nregion fell quickly into decay..” (UT).\n\nSurvivors of the Plague did remain in Tharbad, however, and the road\nthrough it continued to be a significant trade route for another 350\nyears, until the fall of Arthedain in TA 1974. The town's importance\ncontinued to decline, however, and by TA 2050, the nearby native\nDunlendings, as well as the people left in Tharbad no doubt;\n\n_..ceased in fact to be subjects of Gondor; the Royal Road was unkempt\nin Enedwaith, and the Bridge of Tharbad became ruinous, and was replaced\nonly by a dangerous ford._\n\nTharbad was still inhabited for another 862 years, despite the absence\nof any sort of central government, presumably by a people akin to the\nBree-men and Dunlendings. During this period, the decrepit remains of\nthe Great South Road above Tharbad became known as 'The Greenway', even\nafter Tharbad itself was finally “ruined and deserted” (LR) in TA 2912,\nwhen great floods devastated Enedwaith following the Fell Winter.\n\nBy the time of the War of the Ring a century later;\n\n_When Boromir made his great journey from Gondor to Rivendell - the\ncourage and hardihood required is not fully recognized in the narrative\n- the North-South Road no longer existed except for the crumbling\nremains of the causeways, by which a hazardous approach to Tharbad might\nbe achieved, only to find ruins on dwindling mounds, and a dangerous\nford formed by the ruins of the bridge, impassable if the river had not\nthere been slow and shallow - but wide._\n\nOthers occasionally crossed the ruined bridge - at their peril -\nincluding the Ringwraiths, servants and spies of Sauron, as well as the\nRangers of the North who sought Aragorn in Rohan in TA 3019.\n\nFourth Age\n\nIn the early Fourth Age, the “ruined town” was probably rebuilt and\nresettled at last by King Elessar, and repopulated by both Rohirrim and\nMen of the Reunited Kingdom.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nTharbad was a Sindarin word that meant 'The Crossing Place'. or 'across\nway'"

    "text": "UMBAR was a Mannish realm to the far south of Gondor in\nMiddle-earth where the descendants of the King's Men lived, and in\nduring the Great Years was known for the sea-faring Corsairs who reigned\nthere in the havens that were built during the reign of the Kings of\nGondor.\n\nThe great cape and land-locked firth of Umbar south of the Bay of\nBelfalas formed a natural harbour of enclosing rock, but the “great\nfortress of Númenor” that was located within it was not built until SA\n2280. It was only by this time that Sauron had dared to threaten\nNúmenor;\n\n    _..the strength of his terror and mastery over men had grown\n    exceedingly great, he began to assail the strong places of the\n    Númenóreans upon the shores of the sea._\n    (from the “Akallabêth”, in The Silmarillion)\n\n\nHistory\n\nLike the earlier New Haven in Enedwaith, and the later Pelargir on the\nAnduin, Umbar became a base from which Númenórean influence spread over\nMiddle-earth. It was at Umbar that the last King of Númenor, Ar-Pharazôn\nthe Golden, landed in SA 3261, to challenge Sauron:\n\n    _The fleet came at last to that place that was called Umbar, where\n    was a mighty haven that no hand had wrought. Empty and silent under\n    a sickle moon was the land when the King of the Sea set foot upon\n    the shore. For seven days he journeyed with banner and trumpet. Then\n    he sent forth heralds, and he commanded Sauron to come before him\n    and swear to him fealty._\n    ('Akallabêth' from “The Silmarillion”)\n\nAfter the Downfall of Númenor 58 years later, Umbar remained in the\nhands of the Númenóreans, in essence a Realm in Exile alongside Arnor\nand Gondor. But unlike these others, Umbar had been used by the 'King's\nMen', who had turned to the worship of Melkor in the last days of\nNúmenor. These 'King's Men' were not friendly to the Elves or to their\nfellow Númenórean survivors who were allied to the elves, and became\nknown as Black Númenóreans.\n\nTwo Black Númenórean lords known as Herumor and Fuinur, probably from\nUmbar rose to power at the end of Second Age they became very powerful\namongst the Haradrim, a neighbouring people of whom they were allied.\nTheir fate is unknown, but they likely shared Sauron's defeat at the\nhands of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.\n\n\n\nThe rulers of Umbar retained much influence over the Haradwaith well\ninto the Third Age. When not part of Gondor, its system of government\nwas no doubt tyrannical, but it may also have been a duumvirate: Black\nNúmenórean and Corsair Lords are paired when mentioned; Herumor/Fuinur\nfor example, and later Angamaitë/Sangahyando.\n\nGondor's power, however, eclipsed that of Umbar as the Third Age\nprogressed, and in TA 933 Gondor's King Eärnil I captured Umbar in a\nsurprise attack, although this was “at great cost.”\n\nFor the following 500 years, Umbar was an important city of Gondor: not\nonly a major seaport, but as the site of the submission of Sauron to\nAr-Pharazôn, and so served as a proud reminder of the might of the\nDúnedain of old:\n\n    _on the highest hill of the headland above the Haven they (…) set a\n    great white pillar as a monument. It was crowned with a globe of\n    crystal that took the rays of the Sun and of the Moon and shone like\n    a bright star that could be seen in clear weather even on the coasts\n    of Gondor or far out upon the western sea._\n    ('The Heirs of Elendil' from “The Peoples of Middle-earth”)\n\nUmbar's Golden Age\n\nUmbar's power reached its Golden Age under the four “Ship-Kings”:\n\nThe Heirs of Castamir\n\n-   Castamir the Usurper the first Ship-king of Umbar- TA 1975 - TA 2106\n\n&nbsp;\n-   CASTAHER- TA 2106- TA 2177\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Angamaitë- TA 2177- TA 2247\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Sangahyando- TA 2247 - TA 2319\n\n    Many Black Númenóreans had fled Umbar from the assault of TA 933, to\n    their subjects in Near Harad, but 82 years later, in a vain attempt\n    to recapture it,\n    _the Men of the Harad, led by the lords that had been driven from\n    Umbar, came up with great power against that stronghold.._\n    ('Annals of the Kings and Rulers' from Appendix A to “The Lord of\n    the Rings”)\n\nThis 'great power' availed the Men of Harad little, however, for despite\ninvesting and besieging the fortress of Umbar for 35 years, they failed\nto take it, as its supply was easily maintained, “because of the\nsea-power of Gondor”. In TA 1050, the late King Earnil's son Ciryandil,\n\n    _came down from the north by sea and by land, and crossing the river\n    Harnen his armies utterly defeated the Men of the Harad.._\n    ('Annals of the Kings and Rulers' from Appendix A to “The Lord of\n    the Rings”)\n\nGondor's possession of Umbar came to an abrupt end In TA 1448, but not\nat the hands of an external foe. Following the disastrous Kin-strife,\nthe sons of Castamir the Usurper arrived there with many men and most of\nthe fleet of Gondor.\n\n    _There they made a refuge for all the enemies of the king, and a\n    lordship independent of his crown. Umbar remained at war with Gondor\n    for many lives of men.._\n    ('Appendix A' ~ “The Lord of the Rings”)\n\nThese men became known as the “Corsairs of Umbar”, and within two\ncenturies became a major threat to Gondor. In TA 1634 Castamir's\ngreat-grandsons Angamaitë and Sangahyando raided Pelargir, from Umbar,\nkilling King Minardil, but Gondor could not retaliate as it was ravaged\nby the Great Plague. Vengeance, if not swift, was certainly devastating:\n78 years after Minardil's death, his great-grand nephew succeeded in\nbriefly recapturing Umbar, and even renamed himself Umbardacil. However,\n\n    _..in the new evils that soon befell Gondor Umbar was again lost,\n    and fell into the hands of the Men of Harad._\n    ('Annals of the Kings and Rulers' from Appendix A to “The Lord of\n    the Rings”)\n\nThroughout the rest of the Third Age, Umbar was home a new generation of\n'Corsairs of Umbar', who must have been closely related to the Haradrim,\nif not even merely Haradrim themselves. These new Corsairs were cruel\nslavers who often raided the coasts of Belfalas and Anfalas in Gondor:\nin TA 2746 for example, Amrothos, the 15th Prince of Dol Amroth fell\ndefending Dol-en-Ernil against them.\n\nIn TA 2758 Umbar joined a massive coordinated attack with Men of the\nHarad and even of Dunland, against Gondor and the new realm of Rohan:\n\n    _Three great fleets, long prepared, came up from Umbar and the\n    Harad, and assailed the coasts of Gondor in great force; and the\n    enemy made many landings, even as far north as the mouth of the\n    Isen._\n    ('Annals of the Kings and Rulers' from Appendix A to “The Lord of\n    the Rings”)\n\nIn TA 2885 Umbar supported the Haradrim who claimed Harondor, although\nthis had long “been a debatable land between the Corsairs and the\nKings”, and when Sauron declared himself openly in TA 2951, Umbar\ndeclared its allegiance to him, and the great monument commemorating\nAr-Pharazôn's triumph at Umbar was thrown down.\n\nUmbar's fleet was largely destroyed 29 years later, when Thorongil\n(Aragorn, as it later turned out) in the service of the Steward of\nGondor Ecthelion II led a taskforce south and burned them, killing the\nCaptain of the Haven in the process.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Umbar had not fully recovered from this, but\ncould still send 50 'great ships' and smaller vessels “beyond count”, to\nraid the coastlands of Gondor and draw off major forces from the defence\nof Minas Tirith. They were once again defeated by Aragorn, and the Army\nof the Dead. With the Fall of Barad-dûr, Umbar, weakened and defeated,\nfinally lost its sovereignty and submitted to the crown of King Elessar.\n\nUmbar appeared on the bottom edge of the maps found in earlier editions\nof _The Lord of the Rings_, but it is absent from modern editions, which\nregrettably map a slightly smaller area of Middle-earth.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_UMBAR_ was a Quenyan word that meant 'fate-'."

    "title": "Ainulindalë",
    "page_id": "570",
    "text": "AINULINDALË (Quenya; IPA: ; _Music of the Ainur,_ also known as The\nGREAT MUSIC, and THE GREAT SONG) is the initial chapter of _The\nSilmarillion_, edited and published by Christopher Tolkien after his\nfather's death. As part of the Tolkien Middle-earth cycle, _Ainulindalë_\nplays the role of its , or creation story. Many of the themes and\nstorylines revealed in the later histories (in _The Lord of the Rings,_\nfor example) find their first expression in _Ainulindalë._\n\n\nSummary\n\nThe Ainur and the Matter of their Music\n\nThe opening paragraphs of _Ainulindalë_ concern the time before the\ncreation of the World and before the beginning of Time. First to be\nnamed is Eru Ilúvatar ('Father of All', also called Eru – 'the One, He\nthat is Alone'). Ilúvatar makes the Ainur (meaning 'Holy Ones', singular\nform Ainu) by manifesting his concepts as living beings. Upon their\ncreation, when nothing else yet is made, Ilúvatar teaches the Ainur the\nart of 'Music', which becomes their life and work.\n\nThe next lines speak to the maturation of the Ainur and the cultivation\nof Heaven’s Music into the First Theme. Heaven becomes filled with the\nmaking of Music. With each Ainu comprehending at first only those\nsecondary ideas and themes most closely related to that primary\nidea-theme-thought of Ilúvatar’s which pre-figured itself, these\ncreative musical elaborations only gradually, through exposure to each\nother, become collaborative. The compositions revolve around themes\ngiven to each Ainu by Ilúvatar, which themes correspond respectively to\nthose primary themes/concepts embodied in each Ainu – that indeed are\neach Ainu. Through listening and contemplation, an Ainu becomes aware of\nother Ainur, other musics, and the cultivation and adornment of other\nthemes.\n\nAfter a time of Music, Ilúvatar proposes a first 'great'\ndesign/theme/plan to all the Ainur at once. He charges them with the\ncollective elaboration of this great design/plan/theme.\n\nWhile it is true that the Ainur are Ilúvatar’s thoughts embodied, they\neach have a life of their own, and are expected to utilize their\n'freedom' by cultivating the grand theme. Only in the future, at the\n'end of days', will all the created beings of Ilúvatar fully understand\nnot only the divinely provided concepts and themes they each personally\nembody, but how each relates to all the others and fits (as per\nIlúvatar’s intentions) in the entire greater scheme.\n\nMelkor and the Great Music of the Ainur\n\n1. Melkor is introduced, and the Ainur begin their Chorus. The first\nAinu to be named in the histories, Melkor ('Arises in Might') is\ndescribed as the most powerful of the Ainur and as knowing much of\nIlúvatar’s thoughts, including something of each of the primary themes\nthat prefigure the other Ainur. He develops impatience with the\nschooling process of thematic elaboration: like a precocious child,\nMelkor begins thinking of certain musical ideas and themes as being 'all\nhis own', and he feels compelled to develop them apace. Melkor even\nharbors the desire to externally manifest his ideas (private ideas, as\nhe thinks them) and to become a creator of beings himself. When the\nchoirs of the Ainur finally embark on the fully collaborative\nelaboration of Ilúvatar’s grand plan, Melkor participates with all the\nothers, yet he stands forth and inserts his very different thematic\nadornments, which disrupts the harmony. One reason his music is so\ndifferent is that he has spent too much time alone, so his themes appear\nto have a singular, rather than contextual, origin. The 'battle' in the\nchoir of the Ainur rages back and forth with the Music akin Ilúvatar\ndescribed as “deep and wide and beautiful, but slow and blended with an\nimmeasurable sorrow, from which its beauty chiefly came”. Melkor’s\nmusic, on the other hand, is said to have been \"loud, and vain, and\nendlessly repeated  and it essayed to drown the other music by the\nviolence of its voice … \" (Ibid.). But, despite Melkor’s best efforts to\nmar and utterly overthrow the Great Music, his discordant music's “most\ntriumphant notes were taken by the other and woven into its own solemn\npattern” (Ibid. [Compare Book of Lost Tales – Vol. 1, “One was very\ngreat and deep and beautiful, but it was mingled with an unquenchable\nsorrow, while the other was now grown to unity and a system of its own,\nbut was loud and vain and arrogant, braying triumphantly against the\nother as it thought to drown it, yet ever, as it essayed to clash most\nfearsomely, finding itself but in some manner supplementing or\nharmonising with its rival”. also Compare The Lost Road “The other had\ngrown now to a unity and system, yet an imperfect one, save in so far as\nderived still from the eldest theme of Ilúvatar...”).\n\n2. The Great Music of the Ainur progresses thus: Ilúvatar introduces a\nFirst Theme to the choir of the Ainur and Melkor 'spoils' it, converting\nmany of the Maiar to his cause in later years (these fallen Maiar become\nin the later histories characters like the Balrogs, Ungoliant and Sauron\nhimself.) Next, Ilúvatar imposes a Second Theme, and again Melkor\ncorrupts it. Ilúvatar then proposes a Third Theme, which is also\ninfected by Melkor and devolves into a raging disharmonious conflict.\nIlúvatar puts an end to the disharmony with the conducting of “…one\nchord, deeper than the Abyss, higher than the Firmament, piercing as the\nlight of the eye of Ilúvatar…” (Ibid.) After the Great Music stops,\nIlúvatar promptly chastises Melkor and then leaves the room. This causes\nMelkor to be ashamed which in its turn causes him to become angry.\n\nThe Great Vision: Water, Ulmo, the Music and Fate\n\n1. Ilúvatar next 'shows' the Ainur a 'Vision'. The Vision is of what the\ntransliteration of their collaborative Great Music into a material\nreality would be like. They are shown that the Music has a point, has a\nresult and effect beyond its composition and singing: it amounts to no\nless than a highly detailed template commensurate with the entire\nhistory – beginning to end – of a material, 'physical' Universe that\ncould exist inside 'time'. During this sneak preview of the Birth, Life\nand Death of the Universe, the Ainur behold and contemplate all the\naspects of material reality, which aspects are each associated with\nthemes associated with particular Ainu. As the Ainur gaze out on this\npreview, Melkor sees now in detail how even his most private ideas and\nthemes, even his most disruptive and destructive efforts, in the end\nserve only to fully elaborate Ilúvatar’s master plan, design, theme and\nwill. Melkor is shown that his private themes (as Melkor thought them)\nare in fact elements of that plan/design/will and “tributary to \nglory.”\n\n2. Now the Third theme and the Children (Eldar and Edain) are discussed.\nThe Ainur see in the Vision that there are things none of them remember\ncomposing, and things they perhaps remember composing but did not at the\ntime fully understand. The Children of Ilúvatar are first mentioned\nhere, the future home of the Children (Arda –'the Realm', i.e. the\nEarth) is spotted, and some positively fascinating advice is given:\ndon’t read too much into the relative size of the Earth as compared to\nthe entire Universe, or be overly impressed with the immensity of Space\ncompared to, say, the delicacy and complexity of design in a mustard\nseed. Many of the Ainur, including Melkor, become enamored of the Earth,\nthough Melkor still wants to dominate it and the Children. The Ainur,\nlooking out at the preview of all creation, come to believe that Water,\nof all the substances and energies of material reality, most completely\nechoes the collaborative elaboration that was the propounding and\ncultivating of Ilúvatar’s entire creative plan (i.e., the Great Music of\nthe Ainur. ) The Ainur rejoice in Light, but at the sounds of the Sea,\nthey feel “a great unquiet.” (Ibid, p 19. [Compare “…and for the great\nroaring of the ocean they {Ainur} were filled with longing.” Book of\nLost Tales, Vol. 1)\n\n3. Ulmo is introduced. While Melkor is the first Ainu properly named,\nand the first Ainu to whom Ilúvatar directly speaks in the histories,\nUlmo ('The Pourer' or 'The Rainer') is the second on both counts: right\nafter the point is made that Water is the fullest echo of the Music of\nthe Ainur, Ulmo is introduced as the Ainu most identified with that\nelement, and the Ainu most educated in the matter of Music. Ulmo is the\nsecond Ainu to whom Ilúvatar specifically speaks in the histories when\nHe points out to Ulmo that Water has from Melkor’s meddling benefited\nbeyond Ulmo’s earlier conceptions. Melkor’s attempts to disrupt with the\nuse of fierce heat and severe cold do nothing to ruin Water (as Melkor\nmust have hoped), but rather leave the World with the beauties of snow\nand frost and clouds and rain; this does no less than push Manwë and\nUlmo more closely together. Ulmo, first of all the Ainur (Melkor\nincluded), has his words quoted in the histories when he says, “'Truly,\nWater is become now fairer than my heart imagined, neither had my secret\nthought conceived the snowflake, nor in all my music was contained the\nfalling of the rain. I will seek Manwë, that he and I may make melodies\nfor ever to thy delight!'” (Ibid.), and so Ulmo and Manwë are revealed\nas the two chief servants of Ilúvatar’s intentions.\n\nGenesis\n\n1.  The Vision ends: Ilúvatar’s sneak preview is snatched away before\n    any of the Ainur can fully see or comprehend the whole work of their\n    music-made-into-substance. Because of this, and because of their\n    nature as beings that must grow to an understanding of themselves in\n    the context of the interplay of all creation, the Ainur know quite a\n    bit of the past, present and future of the Universe and its\n    inhabitants, yet they don’t know everything (the later days,\n    especially, are hidden from them). When the vision is taken away,\n    the Ainur are restless, having fallen in love with the Universe, the\n    Earth and the Children. Even Melkor thinks that he wants to be a\n    benign part of their manifestation, though his tendencies must lead\n    more toward dominance than cultivation.\n2.  Time begins. In the end (of the Beginning), Ilúvatar takes the\n    entire musical work of the Ainur, including Melkor’s destructive\n    efforts, and makes it manifest, material, real, objective and\n    existing as Eä ('It is', or 'Let it Be'), or what can be called the\n    Universe. Many of the most powerful and influential Ainur enter into\n    Eä, but they enter on condition that the life of the Universe, which\n    has a beginning, middle and end, corresponding to the Great Music of\n    the Ainu, will be binding on them, and will become their lives as\n    well. The Valar (‘The Powers’, the most powerful Ainur that enter\n    into the Universe) enter into and became a part of the World at the\n    very beginning of Time, but Melkor is amongst them.\n\nThe Struggle to Fulfill Fate\n\n1.  The remaining paragraphs of _Ainulindalë_ summarize the first\n    efforts of the Valar to fulfill the destiny described in the vision\n    of the Universe they have foreseen in Heaven. The Valar enter into\n    Eä only to find it at the very beginning of its history – unformed\n    and embryonic. The history of the Universe has been only 'forsung'.\n    The Valar must labor to unfold that history and to build its\n    constituent parts from scratch. The four Valar who are most involved\n    in the crafting of the Earth are Manwë, Ulmo, Aulë and Melkor.\n    Melkor lays claim to the Earth as his own, and makes the initial\n    going very rough indeed. Manwë collects those Valar and Maiar\n    (lesser Ainur who entered into Eä with the Valar) friendly to him\n    and he sets up on Earth a resistance to Melkor. At the moment of\n    this act, a reminder is provided of the fact that Manwë was the\n    chief instrument of Ilúvatar in the Second Theme of the Great Music.\n    Melkor withdraws from Earth and Manwë’s resistance, but later\n    formally (and quite impressively) reenters and makes open war on\n    Manwë's throne, but Manwë’s rule is established nonetheless: it sees\n    the Earth finished and made habitable and ready for Elves and Men.\n2.  The First War inside Time: The Valar assume physical forms as others\n    wear clothes, though the Valar do have temperaments commensurate\n    with the genders these forms reflect. Melkor re-enters the Earth in\n    a form of terrible majesty, and the war for Earth begins in earnest.\n    The history of the first battles are little recorded, but the\n    reports point to Melkor trying to undo everything the Valar do,\n    which things the Valar do mostly to prepare the Earth for the\n    Children. Melkor's actions can change, but not destroy or wholly\n    spoil, the original (as they were understood) plans and intentions\n    of the Valar. Despite Melkor, the Earth is made ready.\n\nDagor Dagorath and the second song of Illuvatar\n\nAfter the prophesied war of all wars, the Dagor Dagorath, the final war\nthat will decide the fate of all beings on Arda. It is said that the\nAinur will sing the second song of Eru Ilúvatar, not knowing what will\nbe created. Yet greater it will be, more races borne of the melodies.\nReforming life. It is said the the Dwarves will assist Mahal (Aulë) in\nrecreating the materials of Arda, to rekindle the flames that spark\nindustry. To give birth to a new age.\n\n\nAppearances"

    "text": "DUNLAND was the land of the wild men, or 'Dunlendings'. _Dunland_ means\n_Hill Land_ in the language of neighboring Rohan, whose people named it\nafter arriving in nearby Calenardhon in the later Third Age.\n\n\nInhabitants\n\nDunland was inhabited by the Dunlendings, Men who were mostly bearded\nand had dirty faces, and long matted hair. They wore clothes of leather\nand animal skin and carried weapons that were simple but effective for\ntheir purpose. They usually fought with clubs and pitchforks, and at\ntimes they carried torches to act as lights at night and to burn\nbuildings by day. The buildings that Dunlendings lived and worked in\nwere crude shacks of wood and animal skin that were often sabotaged by\nWargs and sometimes the Rohirrim.\n\nThe vernacular of this land's inhabitants, including possibly the\nStoors, was Dunlendish.\n\nAncestors of the Dunlendings inhabited the forested regions of\nMiddle-earth on either side of the Gwathló in the early Second Age; thus\nthe early Númenóreans called them _Gwaithuirim_. They spoke a language\nrelated to that of the Second House of Men, the Haladin, rather than the\nvastly different Bëorian-Marachian tongue which stood at the base of\nAdûnaic, and this lack of mutual understanding led to outright\nhostility. The Númenóreans greedily harvested _Gwaithuirim_ forests for\ntimber, and after much war and bloodshed, the _Gwaithuirim_ from south\nof the Gwathló fled east to the Hithaeglir while others scattered to the\ncape of Eryn Vorn and the White Mountains.\n\nAt the end of the Second Age, the land north of the Gwathló and south of\nthe Baranduin was named Minhiriath “Land between the Rivers”, although\nthe land south of Minhiriath remained unnamed. Its inhabitants were\nlargely ignored despite the fact that the Gondor colonial city of\nTharbad grew up on the Gwathló west of the Misty Mountain hillfolk who\nhad been _Gwaithuirim_ long before. It was not until Gondor abandoned\nthis city in TA 2050 that the people and their land were renamed: both\nbecame known as Enedwaith “Middle-Folk, Middle Region”, because they\nowed no allegiance to the North or South Kingdom.\n\nThe Hillfolk of the Hithaeglir kept their hatred of the descendants of\nNúmenor (unlike those of Eryn Vorn and the White Mountains, who\nnevertheless remained uncooperative). The Dead Men of Dunharrow who\nbetrayed Isildur were descended from _Gwaithurim_.\n\nIn T.A. 2770, Smaug the Dragon destroyed the Kingdom under the Mountain.\nDwarves fleeing from this disaster settled in Dunland, from\nwhere Thrór departed when he and his companion Nár journeyed\nto Moria in T.A. 2790. After the Battle of Azanulbizar, provoked by\nthe Orcs' brutal slaying of Thrór, Thráin II and Thorin led the remnants\nof their followers back to Dunland but soon left (to eventually settle\nin the Blue Mountains).\n\nWhen Gondor decided to give the depopulated province of Calenardhon to\nthe numerous people of Éothéod in TA 2510, the Hillfolk of the\nHithaeglir felt threatened by these _Forgoil_ “Strawheads” (a demeaning\nreference to the blonde hair of the refugees from Calenardhon). The\nHillfolk had slowly colonised Calenardhon during the dwindling of the\nDúnedain and had already reclaimed all the land between the Adorn and\nIsen. Still, open war was not waged until the reign of Helm Hammerhand\n(TA 2741 - TA 2759). Freca, the Lord of the Hillmen (whom the Rohirrim\nnow called Dunlendings) tried to get the throne of Rohan for himself by\npetitioning for the marriage of his son Wulf to the daughter of Helm.\nThe Hill-men leader Freca was killed and Wulf led the Dunlendings into\nopen war with Rohan. They unsuccessfully besieged the Hornburg during\nthe Long Winter of TA 2758 - TA 2759. Wulf did take Edoras and killed\nHaleth, the son of Helm, in front of the golden hall of Meduseld.\nNonetheless, Helm's nephew Fréalaf held out against the Dunlendings in\nthe refuge of Dunharrow. He recaptured Edoras at the end of the Long\nWinter and killed Wulf personally. The Dunlendings were driven out of\nRohan, and Fréalaf succeeded the deceased Helm Hammerhand.\n\nGuarding the Gap of Rohan was the fortress of Isengard, where a\nhereditary guard watched for Gondor. However, by the time of the Steward\nof Gondor Beren, these guards had mixed with Dunlendings, and it had\nbecome hostile to Gondor. To remedy this situation, Beren gave Saruman\nthe keys to Orthanc to guard Isengard for Gondor.\n\nSaruman used the historical hostility against outlanders to tempt the\nDunlendings into supporting him during the War of the Ring. In The Two\nTowers extended edition, the Dunlending warlord is shown giving a\nblood-oath to Saruman.\n\nAfter the battle at Helm's Deep, the Rohirrim allowed the surviving\nDunlendings to return to their homes. The Rohirrim required that all\nhostilities cease and that the Dunlendings again retreat behind the\nIsen.\n\n\nNearby locations\n\n-   North: Galanduin River\n-   East: Misty Mountains\n-   South: Isengard\n-   West: Enedwaith\n\n\nPortrayal in Adaptations\n\nIt is represented in _The Lord of the Rings Online_, where it's entirety\nis available for exploration and adventuring."

    "title": "Regions of the Shire",
    "page_id": "653",
    "text": "THE SHIRE is subdivided into several regions.\n\n\nFarthings\n\nThe original parts of the Shire were subdivided into four FARTHINGS\n(“fourth-ings” or “quarterings”): the Three-Farthing stone marked the\npoint where the borders of the Eastfarthing, Westfarthing and\nSouthfarthing of the Shire came together, by the Great East Road.\n\nThe Northfarthing\n\nThe Northfarthing is the least populated part of the Shire. This was the\nsite of the historic Battle of Greenfields.\n\n-   LONG CLEEVE was the home of the small part of the Took clan known as\n    the _North-Tooks_, descendants of Bandobras “Bullroarer” Took, who\n    settled here after the Battle of Greenfields.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   The village of HARDBOTTLE was the home to the Bracegirdle family of\n    Hobbits, to whom Lobelia Sackville-Baggins belonged. Some maps\n    erroneously place Hardbottle in the Southfarthing.\n\nThe Westfarthing\n\nThe western and most populated part of the Shire, this is the site of\nthe towns Michel Delving, Tuckborough (part of Took-land), and Hobbiton.\n\n-   MICHEL DELVING is the chief town of the Shire, located in the White\n    Downs. Its name means simply “large excavation”.\n\n        The Mayor of Michel Delving is the only elected official of The\n        Shire, elected on a seven year term.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   HOBBITON is the village where Bag End is located. This is the home\n    of Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins and the site of the beginning and\n    conclusion of the novels _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_.\n    Sam Gamgee and his grandfather, the “Gaffer”, live on the lane of\n    _Bagshot Row_, below Bag End.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   Bywater is a village a short walk east of Hobbiton. It is best known\n    as the home of two inns, The Green Dragon Inn and The Ivy Bush.\n\nThe Southfarthing\n\nA rural and fertile area, the Southfarthing is the site of the towns\nGamwich (original home of the Gamgee family), Cotton, Longbottom and\nmuch pipe-weed production.\n\n-   LONGBOTTOM, a name meaning “long valley”, was founded by Tobold\n    Hornblower with the introduction of pipe-weed, in TA 2670, allowing\n    the region to become well established due to the success of the\n    pipe-weed industry.\n\nThe Eastfarthing\n\nBorders on Buckland, contains the towns Frogmorton and Whitfurrows and\nthe farms of the Marish. Originally, the Eastfarthing was under the\ncontrol of the Oldbuck family. Even after these became the Brandybucks,\nthe farmers of the Eastfarthing followed the Brandybucks rather than the\nThain and Mayor.\n\n-   THE YALE is the name of the low-lying lands of the Shire's\n    Eastfarthing that lay along the northern side of the long road from\n    Stock westwards to Tuckborough. This seems to have been a sparsely\n    populated area, and in fact the map of the Shire in _The Lord of the\n    Rings_ marks only a single building here.\n    -   The meaning of the Yale's name is obscure. The well-known\n        English personal and placename “Yale” has its origins in a Welsh\n        expression meaning “fertile upland.” Its use may suggest that\n        the Hobbits who named it had contacts with “strange” languages,\n        possibly those of Dunland.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   THE MARISH is the name of fertile, yet boggy farmlands located in\n    the Shire's Eastfarthing. It is where the Oldbuck family is believed\n    to have lived before Gorhendad Oldbuck removed the family across the\n    Brandywine to Buckland and changed their name\n\n\nOther parts of the Shire\n\nThe Buckland and Westmarch are sometimes reckoned part of the Shire,\nthough they are not part of any Farthing. Buckland was described in\nChapter V _A conspiracy unmasked_ in Fellowship of the Ring as being\n_“virtually a small independent country.. a sort of colony of the\nShire.”_ Westmarch became part of the Shire only after the end of the\nevents portrayed in Lord of the Rings, in the fourth age.\n\nBuckland\n\nLocation, villages and borders\n\nBuckland is located east of the Baranduin (Brandywine) river. The\nhobbits living in Buckland grew the High Hay, a hedge, to protect\nthemselves against evil from the nearby Old Forest, which borders\nBuckland to the east. Buckland is bordered in the north by the Hay Gate,\nthe only entrance to Buckland near the Brandywine Bridge. In the south\nthe borders of Buckland follow the High Hay until the Withywindle joins\nthe Baranduin near the village of Haysend. The most important town of\nBuckland is _BUCKLEBURY_ where the Brandy Hall is located, home of the\nMaster of Buckland, one of the important officials of the Shire.\n\nAn important landmark is the _BUCKLEBURY FERRY_, a raft-ferry used as\nthe second main crossing point of the Brandywine River from the Shire to\nBuckland, after the Brandywine Bridge (which is twenty miles further\nsouth). It is apparently left unmanned to be used by hobbit travellers\nas needed. En route to the new house at Crickhollow, Frodo, Sam, Merry\nand Pippin crossed using the Ferry just before the arrival of a Black\nRider, who was forced to go around to the Brandywine Bridge as there\nwere no boats kept on the western bank of the river. (In the film\nversion by Peter Jackson, the encounter is more immediate.)\n\nHistory and Culture\n\nBuckland was settled around TA 2340 by Gorhenhad Oldbuck, the ancestor\nof Meriadoc Brandybuck. Gorhenhad Oldbuck thus became the first Master\nof Buckland. He renamed himself Brandybuck, which remained his family's\nname.\n\nBecause Buckland is east of the Baranduin it isn't part of the land\ngiven to the Hobbits by King Argeleb II of Arthedain. It was thus not\npart of the Shire proper until the beginning of the Fourth Age when King\nElessar made Buckland and the Westmarch officially a part of the Shire.\n\nThe Bucklanders are unlike other hobbits as they are prepared for danger\nand are thus less naive than the Shire-hobbits. They close the Hay Gate\nand their own front doors at night and are prepared to rush to arms when\nthe Horn of Buckland is blown. Most Bucklanders were originally of Stoor\nstock, and they were the only Hobbits known to use boats.\n\nThe Westmarch\n\nAfter the events of the War of the Ring at the start of the Fourth Age\nof Middle-earth, King Aragorn Elessar granted the Hobbits of the Shire\neffective self-rule inside his Reunited Kingdom, banning any men from\nentering the land.\n\nHe also granted the Shire a stretch of new land: this reached from the\nancient western borders of the Shire, the White Downs, to the Tower\nHills.\n\nThe area between the downs and the hills became known as the WESTMARCH.\n\nThe eldest daughter of mayor Samwise Gamgee, Elanor the Fair, married\nFastred of Greenholm, and they moved to the Westmarch. After the passing\nof master Samwise, they and their children became known as the\n_Fairbairns of the Towers_ or _Wardens of Westmarch_, and the Red Book\nof Frodo and Bilbo Baggins passed into their keeping, becoming known as\nthe _Red Book of Westmarch_.\n\nGovernmentally, the Westmarch was a region of itself, and like Buckland\nacross the river Brandywine it was not part of any of the four Farthings\nof the Shire.\n\n Category:The Shire"

    "page_id": "676",
    "text": "Before Oromë found the Elves at Cuiviénen, Melkor enslaved some of them\nand cruelly tortured them, turning them into ORCS.\n\nMany Orcs (along with fallen Maiar and other evil servants of Melkor)\nsurvived in the deep caves, pits, chambers, and tunnels of Melkor's\ngreat underground fortresses of Utumno and Angband. They multiplied and\nlater spread through northern Middle-earth. They were first seen by the\nDwarves who reported them to King Thingol, the High King of the Sindar,\ncausing the latter to seek weapons of war for the first time. For\nover a millennium, the orcs were only a minor problem, but when Melkor\n(Morgoth) returned with the Silmarils he took full charge of them and\nsoon unleashed them on Beleriand. The newly organised orcs killed\nDenethor, the King of the lightly armed Laiquendi, but were eventually\ndefeated by Thingol and his allies. They besieged the Havens of the\nFalas under Círdan, and the siege wasn't broken until the arrival of the\nÑoldor. The heavy losses that the Sindar suffered at the hands of the\nOrcs frightened them to the point that Melian, Queen of Doriath raised a\ngreat enchantment to protect their kingdom. The Laiquendi, who suffered\nthe most in the battle, hid themselves in the Ossiriand under the cloak\nof secrecy, or took refuge in Doriath.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore First Age\n\nMelkor was the first to learn of the Awakening. He soon began sending\nevil spirits among the Elves, who planted seeds of doubt against the\nValar. It is also rumoured that some of the elves were being captured by\na Rider if they strayed too far, and the elves later believed these were\nbrought to Utumno, who cruelly tortured and twisted them into ORCS.\n\nFirst Age\n\nIn the First Age, thousands of Orcs were bred in Angband by Morgoth and\nto participate in the Battles of Beleriand, which lasted 587 years. They\nfirst appeared in the Battle of Lhammoth, where they were defeated by\nthe Noldor. When the House of Fëanor returned to Middle-earth Morgoth\nsent a force of Orcs against them. Although the Orcs outnumbered the\nexiles they were no match for the power and wrath of the Ñoldor, and\nwere quickly and easily defeated. However, Fëanor could not defeat the\npower of Morgoth alone and he was killed, leaving the Orcs to continue\nto breed under the Dark Lord. Years later, when the House of Fingolfin\narrived in Middle-earth, Orcs were sent against them as well, but they\nwere utterly defeated in the Battle of the Lammoth.\n\nAfter their crushing defeat in the Dagor Aglareb and in a minor raid on\nHithlum, the Orcs nevertheless regained their numbers and fought again\nin large numbers in the Dagor Bragollach and Nirnaeth Arnoediad. They\nwere nearly destroyed in the War of Wrath, and those that survived fled\neastwards into the Mountains of Angmar and the Grey Mountains.\n\nSecond Age and on\n\nSometime around SA 1000, Sauron reappeared in Middle-earth and made the\nland of Mordor his realm, and then started to build the foundations of\nBarad-Dûr. During the War of the Elves and Sauron in SA 1700, the Orcs\nformed the main host of Sauron's power. Despite the immeasurable number\nof Orcs present, the battle was won by the Elves and the Numenoreans due\nto their united force and numbers.\n\nUntil Sauron's final downfall in the Third Age, Orcs remained the\nbackbone of the armies of Mordor, and of Isengard when Saruman ruled it.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nAppearances\n\nIn Tolkien's writings, Orcs were evil, cruel, wicked, hateful,\nblackhearted, and hated everybody and everything, particularly the\norderly and prosperous. Physically, they were short in stature\n(unless of the Uruk variety) and humanoid in shape. They were generally\nsquat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, bow-legged, with wide mouths\nand slant eyes, long arms, dark skin, and fangs. Tolkien describes one\n“huge Orc chieftain” as “almost Man-high”, and some must have been close\nto Hobbit height, as Sam and Frodo are able to disguise themselves as\nOrcs in Mordor. They were shaped in mockery of the elves(and possibly\nmen) they descended from. They were humanoid in shape with pointed ears,\nsharpened teeth and grimy skin. Their appearance was considered\nrevolting by most of the other races.\n\nOrcs made no beautiful things, but many clever ones including machines,\ntools, weapons, and instruments of torture, were delighted by wheels,\nengines, and explosions, and could tunnel and mine as well as any but\nthe most skilled Dwarves. This was so since the day they were bred by\nMelkor from corrupted, tortured and mutilated Men. They hate themselves\nand have an even deeper hatred of the Dark Lord who has brought them to\nthis end. The result is a violent and warlike race in a perpetual state\nof chaos with itself and others. Despite their abominable nature, they\nare not dim-witted and are clever and crafty and make good tools,\nweapons, and machines of war but produce no beautiful things nor do they\ntrade or share anything with others, unless ordered to by a Dark Lord\nfor the purposes of war and conquest. Their tools and weapons, however,\nare of poor quality when compared to those of the Free Peoples.\n\nThey also developed tunnel-making, for living underground away from the\nlight. Wickedness and violence were their nature, and they were known to\nquarrel and kill each other over petty things. An example of this\ndestructiveness was its effect on nature such as was the case with\nforests and trees, which were often destroyed to fuel their war-making.\nSee: Fangorn forest during the War of the Ring and the western part of\nMiddle-earth after Sauron's War on the Elves in the mid-Second Age.\nHowever, perhaps the best example of this was during the War of the\nRing, when two different groups of Orc soldiers captured the Hobbit\nFrodo Baggins, and then killed each other to the last in the Tower of\nCirith Ungol due to a quarrel over his belongings. This allowed Samwise\nGamgee to rescue Frodo and ultimately caused the destruction of the One\nRing. Orcs generally hated all Elves, Dwarves, and Men, and yet some\nwere said to make alliances with wicked Dwarf groups and others with\ncorrupted Men. Without the leadership of a Dark Lord, Orcs usually live\nin tribal communities in underground lairs under mountains under the\nrule of brutal chieftains, raiding and pillaging settlements of other\nraces that are unfortunate enough to live near them. Thus, they were\nhated by almost every race that knows them, even those allied with them.\nWithout firm leadership, Orcs presumably went into battle often in\ncomplete disarray and without any semblance of formation or tactics.\nTheir strength in combat came from numbers and sheer violence. Due to\nsuperior organization, training and weaponry, Men, Dwarves, Elves, and\nat times even Hobbits, were able to defeat larger numbers of Orcs,\nprovided an ability to withstand the horror and shock of the initial\nonslaught.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Tolkien's Sindarin language, “Orc” is _orch_, plural _yrch_. In his\nlate, post-_Lord of the Rings_ writings (published in _The Peoples of\nMiddle-earth)_, he preferred the spelling “Ork”, evidently mainly to\navoid the form _Orcish_, which would be naturally pronounced with the c\nas /s/ instead of /k/. (In Tolkien's languages the letter _c_ was always\npronounced /k/.) It is also possible that the word is a Common Tongue\nVersion of 'orch', the Sindarin word for Orc. The original sense of the\nword seems to be “bogey”, “bogeyman”, that is, something that provokes\nfear, as seen in the Quenya cognate _urko_, pl. _urqui_. In the old\nEnglish Orc means “demon.” The term _Uruk-hai_ merely means\n“orc-folk” in the Black Speech, and was the Uruk-hai's name for\nthemselves.\n\nOther names\n\n“GORGÛN” was the name that Ghân-buri-Ghân of the wild men of the Drúadan\nForest used for the Orcs in their own language.\n\n'''“Yrrch” '''was the name used by Haldir and his brother, Elves of\nLothlorien. This same variation on “orc” was also used by Legolas\nindicating that it is Sindarin.\n\n\nNotable Orcs\n\n\n\n-   Azog\n-   Balcmeg\n-   Boldog\n-   Bolg\n-   Golfimbul\n-   Gorbag\n-   Gorgol\n-   Gothmog\n-   The Great Orc\n-   Grishnákh\n-   Lagduf\n-   Muzgash\n-   Radbug\n-   Shagrat\n-   Snaga\n-   Ufthak\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nPeter Jackson's film trilogy\n\nIn the Peter Jackson films, orcs range greatly in appearance. Skin\ncolour ranges from bone white (Azog and Bolg) and peachy colours (orcs\nlike Gothmog) to shades of green. Most Orcs however, are shown as having\ndarker shades of black or brown skin. Some orcs are also much more\nhuman-like than others, Azog looks like a large and muscular but pale\nand hairless human whilst Gothmog looks much more deformed and less\nhuman-like. In general the Orcs tend to be shorter than most men. Early\norcs shown are particularly slack with poor posture and broad with long\narms (Grishnakh is a good example of this shape) but some later Orcs are\na more human shape. Another variety of Orc appears in The Hobbit: An\nUnexpected Journey. These orcs are short mutated creatures covered in\ndubious warts and unidentified growths. They have pallid pinkish-white\nskin, large heads, and bat-like or porcine facial features. Many of\nthese orcs also had small amounts of thinning white hair, and cataracts\non their sensitive eyes. Also notable is the size of these orcs: while\nsome were easily as big as a man, others were so small they'd be hard\npressed to reach a Hobbit's shoulder height.\n\nThe clothing and armour they wear also ranges greatly. The orcs seem to\nwear an assortment of different styles of armour and clothing and also\ncommonly have various piercings and tribal scars. The clothing and\narmour was probably scavenged. Other Orcs wear specifically designed and\nmade uniform armour for battle. Orcs are often bald or balding, but\nthere are also Orcs who have longer matted hair. The Orcs' hair is\nnearly always dark or greying in colour, but in The Return of the King\nsome orcs with blonde hair and beards can be seen marching from Minas\nMorgul. The favourite weapon of the Orcs is an Orc Scimitar, used by\nOrcs from all areas.\n\n\nGallery"

    "title": "Battle of Isengard",
    "page_id": "745",
    "text": "The BATTLE OF ISENGARD was described as an assault launched by a large\ngroup of Ents and Huorns. Persuaded by Treebeard to take action, they\nattacked Isengard and liberated the fortress, although they could not\nbring down Orthanc. It wasn't very well protected, as all the Uruk-hai\nhad been sent to Rohan, leaving only weak Orcs behind.\n\nTreebeard tore down the gates of Isengard as many Orcs fled and were\nkilled by the many Huorns now surrounding Isengard. Saruman was on the\ngrounds when the attack began and retreated to Orthanc, almost caught by\nthe Ent, Quickbeam. Once Saruman was inside he started up the machinery\nhoused underground, with several Ents scorched by the fumes and fires\nthat erupted. Treebeard then calmed the enraged Ents and put them to\nwork on tearing down the dam, releasing the river and cleansing Isengard\nof Saruman's treachery.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nAfter a three day long Entmoot, an army of Ents and Huorn set off for\nthe tower-fortress of Isengard, making a terrifying racket. They arrived\nand began their attack on March 2. The time of their assault was\nfortunate, because they arrived just when the wizard Saruman was\nemptying Isengard for a final assault on Rohan. As a result, there were\nfew left to defend Isengard besides Saruman himself.\n\nOnce the army of Isengard had left for Rohan, the Ents launched their\nattack on the walls. Attempts were made to hinder them with arrows, but\nthese only served to irritate the attackers further, and, in a matter of\nminutes the Gate and much of the Southern wall was reduced to ruin.\n\n\nThe Battle\n\nAs the Hobbits Merry and Pippin, who were present during the battle,\nlater recounted to their friends, Ents are so strong that their _punches\ncan crumple iron like tinfoil_, and they can _tear apart solid rock like\nbreadcrusts._ A ring of Huorns surrounded Isengard and killed all\nescaping Orcs.\n\nOnce the Gate and walls had been reduced to rubble, a young Ent named\nQuickbeam in the Westron tongue, spotted Saruman, and made for him,\nshouting 'The Tree Killer!', for his people and all Fangorn forest in\ngeneral had suffered from heavy deforestation to fuel the furnaces of\nSaruman. Other Ents followed him, but Saruman succeeded in escaping into\nthe tower of Orthanc. Once in the tower, he activated spouts and vents\nall over the plain, scorching many Ents who had entered the fortress.\nOne Ent, Beechbone, was unlucky enough to be caught fully in one of the\nfiery blasts, and the death of this Ent by Saruman's fire caused the Ent\nhost to go berserk. Merry and Pippin recounted the incident, saying that\nthe enraged roars of the Ents were enough to crack the stones. They\ndestroyed the buildings and machinery on the plain, but could do nothing\nto hurt the tower itself.\n\nAt this point, the Ents took counsel and came up with a new plan of\nattack. By digging trenches and destroying Saruman's dam, the Ents and\nHuorns were to divert the course of the river Isen itself. As the Ents\ndid work destroying the dam, Gandalf appeared to Treebeard and the\nhobbits during the night. Gandalf took counsel with Treebeard, resulting\nin the Huorns' involvement at the Battle of the Hornburg. At midnight,\nthe Ents succeeded in destroying the dam, and the river flooded the\n'bowl' of Isengard, submerging everything but the tower and filling in\nall the tunnels and holes where the machinery of war had been. The\ndestruction of Isengard was complete, although Saruman was still\nuntouched in the tower. Some men from Dunland surrendered and were\nallowed to leave.\n\nThe sound defeat of Saruman's hosts at the Battle of the Hornburg and\nthe destruction of his fortress rendered him incapable of causing the\nWest any further military harm, although he still had the power of his\npersuasive and commanding voice, with which he could still do (and did\ndo) harm. Had the Ents not destroyed Isengard, despite the destruction\nof Saruman's main army, he still could have withstood a siege with his\nfew remaining forces behind Isengard's normally impregnable walls,\nbiding his time until he could renew his strength.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Two Towers film\n\nThe battle is depicted in Peter Jackson's film adaptation of _The Two\nTowers_ (2002). There are a few differences between the novel and film.\nSaruman is already in Orthanc when the Ents arrive, as is Gríma\nWormtongue. There are also many Orcs and Uruks left over at Isengard,\nwhom the Ents destroy while the Huorns leave for Helm's Deep. Merry and\nPippin are also more involved in the battle, sitting on Treebeard's\nbranches and pelting Orcs and wildmen with rocks. Later (Extended ROTK\nversion only) Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Gandalf and Théoden arrive at the\nfoot of Orthanc to extract information from Saruman, but only to be\ngreeted by Saruman's magical voice. He attempts to charm Théoden into\naccepting his offer of peace, but Théoden refuses leaving Saruman to\nretaliate with “Dotard”. The treacherous wizard tries to kill Gandalf\nafter Gandalf offered him mercy, but Gandalf destroys his staff. Théoden\ntries to convince Wormtongue to leave Saruman, but Saruman slaps\nWormtongue in the face in anger. In response, Wormtongue stabs Saruman\nin the back, who falls from Orthanc and lands on a spike. Legolas then\nshoots Wormtongue dead.\n\nVideo games\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: Conquest\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings: Conquest_ game, both the Ents and the\nRohirrim participate. The Rohirrim capture the Pits of Isengard, slaying\nthe Uruk-hai Captain in charge and destroying Saruman's fire machines.\nThis prevented the Ents from taking further fire damage. The Rohirrim\nthen proceed to kill Wormtongue and take the keys to Isengard to\nTreebeard. The Ents take over, destroying all the watchtowers and\ncapturing the Gates of Orthanc. Gandalf then arrives to climb Orthanc\nand kills Saruman."

    "text": "The BATTLE OF OSGILIATH was a battle during the War of the Ring at the\nruined city of Osgiliath - and a prelude to the Battle of the Pelennor\nFields.\n\n\nHistory\n\nPrelude\n\nPrior to this, Sauron had regained all his military strength and was\nprepared to attack Middle-earth. He first planned to attack his most\npowerful enemy, the land of Gondor, where “the hammer stroke will fall\nhardest”, but in order to destroy Gondor's capital, Minas Tirith, he\nfirst needed to capture Osgiliath, a ruined fortress-city strategically\npositioned on the river. Fords across the river were located in\nOsgiliath (half of the city was located on each side of the river) that\nwere the only path a large army could cross the Anduin for hundreds of\nmiles up or downstream (from Cair Andros to Pelargir). If captured,\nSauron could freely move his main army across the river and to the\nprimary target of his strategy in the war, Minas Tirith.\n\nThe Battle\n\nThe battle to control the ruins of Osgiliath had actually been fought,\non and off, for over a century since the fall of Ithilien to Mordor. A\nrenewed offensive by Mordor to take the city had begun several years\nprior to the Quest of Mount Doom (several years before TA 3018), and was\nfought continuously after that point with occasional lulls. The forces\nof Gondor, led by their captain-general Boromir, engaged in fierce urban\nwarfare during this long siege. Under Boromir's command the enemy was\npushed out of the half of the city on the west bank of the river, and on\na strike force including Boromir and his younger brother Faramir was\nable to destroy the last bridge in the city that connected the two banks\nof the river. This prevented Mordor's army from making an easy crossing,\nalthough the fords remained. Sauron not sending more troops to\nOsgiliath, but instead massing them within Mordor for a killing-blow\nmonths later probably caused this lull in the Mordor-offensive. During\nthis break in heavy fighting, Boromir left Gondor to seek counsel at\nRivendell; he would never return.\n\nDuring this time, Faramir led several Ranger attacks deep into\nMordor-occupied Ithilien, ambushing enemy armies moving to the Black\nGate; Frodo and Sam stumbled into one such attack, as told in _The Two\nTowers._\n\nWhen the Great Signal from Mordor went up and another answered from\nMinas Morgul, the War of the Ring properly began, even though Isengard\nhad been fighting before this and Sauron had been pursuing his other\nfronts. Thus, the Battle of Osgiliath was the first battle of the war in\na strict sense.\n\nWhile there were men defending the west side of Osgiliath, the Steward\nDenethor ordered Faramir to lead a force to reinforce them. Faramir\nregarded the order ill advised and certain to result in death, but\ncomplied.\n\nHowever, Mordor was prepared. Months beforehand, the Orcs in East\nOsgiliath had been secretly constructing massive numbers of boats and\nrafts, and swelled with reinforcements from Harad they swarmed across\nthe River Anduin to the Gondor positions on the other bank. After long\nand heavy fighting, the garrison under Faramir and his troops were\nforced to flee back to Minas Tirith, behind the Rammas Echor. Faramir\nhimself was badly wounded in the retreat, when a poisoned Southron arrow\npierced him; more severe damage was done by the Black breath of the\nNazgûl. When the retreat was sure to be a disaster, the knights of the\nDol Amroth sortie led by Imrahil arrived; the pursuing hordes were\ndriven back and the garrison reached the city safely.\n\nIn the meantime, the Orcs made makeshift repairs to several destroyed\nbridges. The main combined army of Mordor then arrived, formed from\nthose that Frodo saw leaving Minas Morgul, but this was “but one and not\nthe greatest of the hosts that Mordor now sent forth”: for on their way\nfrom The Morgul Vale, the orcs the Minas Morgul cavalry led by the\nWitch-king of Angmar had been joined with the Haradrim from the south,\nand a far greater host that had massed at the Black Gate joined them at\nOsgiliath, and the combined forces now entered the western bank of\nOsgiliath. More also came from the fords at Cair Andros, which was\nrecently captured, but they would not reach Minas Tirith until later.\n\nAftermath\n\nOsigiliath now completely in the hands of Mordor, the vast army of\nSauron marched from the city and surrounded Minas Tirith, beginning the\nsiege of Gondor and leading directly into the Battle of the Pelennor\nFields.\n\n\nPortrayal in Adaptations\n\nThe Return of the King\n\nFor cinematic purposes, the movie version of _The Lord of the Rings: The\nReturn of the King_ by Peter Jackson condensed the battle and made\nGondor look much weaker and unfit to fight to add to the cinematic drama\nand add sense of desperation. The Orcs crossed the river at night in\nboats, and immediately join battle with Faramir's men, slaying the Men\nof Gondor easily and brutally defeating them in battle (as opposed to\nthe book were they fought valiantly). By morning, the Men of Gondor lost\nalmost 350 of their men and then abandon the city and retreat in a\nmiserable failure. The Nazgûl riding on top of their Fellbeasts killed\n50 more soldiers, but Gandalf rescues them. In Minas Tirith, Denethor\norders Faramir to retake Osgiliath. Faramir leads a cavalry company of\nthe 100 remaining men and tries to retake Osgiliath, but runs into a\nshower of arrows from the orcs. The whole company is killed except\nFaramir, who is dragged back to Minas Tirith by his horse, unconscious\nwith two arrows in him."

    "title": "Battle of the Black Gate",
    "page_id": "748",
    "text": "The BATTLE OF THE BLACK GATE, also known as the BATTLE OF THE\nMORANNON, was the final major battle of the War of the Ring. It resulted\nin the ultimate defeat of Sauron not by victory on the battlefield, but\nby means of the destruction of the One Ring by the hobbit Frodo.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nAfter the victory of the Free Peoples in the Battle of the Pelennor\nFields, the enemy retreated to Mordor. Sauron was defeated but he still\nhad thousands of Orcs at his disposal in Mordor. He was aware that the\nOne Ring was somewhat close to the vicinity of his territory, but he did\nnot know that the Hobbit Frodo Baggins and his companion Samwise Gamgee\nhad entered Mordor via Morgul Vale with the intention of destroying the\nRing.\n\nPlot against the Dark Lord\n\nAfter the Last Debate, the Men of the West assembled the Host of the\nWest, 10,000 strong, led by Aragorn, who marched on the Black Gate as a\ndiversionary feint to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo and Sam,\nwho were carrying the One Ring through Mordor to be destroyed in the\nfires of Mount Doom. It was hoped that Sauron would think Aragorn had\nthe Ring and was now trying to use it to overthrow him in Mordor.\n\n\n\nMustering\n\nInitially, the Host of the West consisted of 10,000 men, but 3,000\nRohirrim were sent to guard the crossroads, leaving Aragorn with 7,000\nmen. Before they reached Ithilien they were ambushed by Haradrim and\nEasterlings, but they drove them away easily with no casualties.\n\nThen, as they approached Dagorlad, some of the farmers of Lossarnach and\nRohan were too afraid to continue to pass the Desolation of the\nMorannon. Aragorn dismissed the faint-hearted, ordering them to liberate\nCair Andros on the river Anduin. This resulted in the departure of an\nestimated 1000 men, leaving Aragorn with 6,000.\n\nParley with the Dark Lieutenant\n\nBefore the battle began, the Black Gate opened slightly, letting out a\nsmall embassy. At the head was a high servant of Sauron, a Black\nNúmenórean called the Mouth of Sauron, who had been ordered to speak\nwith the Captains of the West. He reasoned that the Army of the West\ncould not defeat Sauron's host on the battlefield, and demanded the Army\nsurrender. The Lieutenant then brought forth several items that had\nbelonged to Frodo and Sam (Sam's sword, an Elven cloak, and Frodo's\nMithril shirt). Gandalf asked for the terms of their surrender, which\nwere to allow Sauron dominion over Isengard and Rohan, as well as\nGondor's vassalage. Gandalf vehemently refused.\n\nRealizing the Army intended to fight and being outnumbered, fear and\nanger overcame the Lieutenant, and he retreated to the Morannon, which\nthen opened to reveal a massive army of Sauron's forces. Thousands of\nOrcs also emerged from the hillsides around the Morannon. In the film\nAragorn, not believing what happened to Frodo, beheads The Mouth of\nSauron.\n\nThe Battle\n\nAgainst the Host of the West was arrayed a large hordes of Orcs, Trolls,\nand Mannish allies such as the Easterlings and Haradrim. An exact count\nis not given of the number of Sauron's forces, but it is said that they\nwere “ten times and more than ten times” greater than the Host of the\nWest, making it a force of at least 60,000. Sauron's forces surrounded\nthe Armies of the West on three sides, with the Easterlings on the left\nflank, the Orcs held the center, and the Haradrim on the right.\nInitially, Sauron's forces found difficulty in getting to the Army of\nthe West, due to the large slag pools and pits of waste surrounding\nparts of the Morannon, which impeded their progress. The Armies of the\nWest always had cohesive stability within their center and kept the\nEnemy from breaking through by force of numbers. The solid infantry\nsquares of Gondor infantry beat off their inferior Orcish opponents\nwhile the Rohirrim cavalrymen staved off the archers of the Harad. The\nsmall force of Easterlings launched a quick attack before being repulsed\nby the armies of Gondor and Rohirrim while the larger Haradrim force\nslowly retreated to the hills. By now, pressure had eased off of the\nflanks of the Armies of the West, who smashed into the lines of the\nOrc-host, slowly beating them off and forcing a retreat back through the\nBlack Gate (though not without suffering sizable losses of their own).\n\n\n\nDuring the course of the battle, the remaining eight Nazgûl emerged and\nattacked the Army of the West. Shortly thereafter, however, the Great\nEagles of the Misty Mountains, led by Gwaihir the Windlord, arrived and\nattacked the Ringwraiths, preventing them from pressing their aerial\nadvantage. Trolls began to crash through the lines of infantry, and the\nOrcs and Easterlings made renewed assaults on the Army of the West,\nencircling it. Many of the soldiers of the West began to become\ndistraught. That was when Frodo put on the One Ring and Sauron realized\nthat Frodo and the Ring were inside Mount Doom.\n\nThe Fall of Barad-dûr and Sauron\n\nThe Nazgûl immediately left the battle to intercept Frodo. Before they\ncould get there however, Gollum bit the Ring off Frodo's finger and\ndanced with joy accidentally falling into the Crack of Doom, destroying\nthe Ring, and Sauron's power was overthrown.\n\n\n\nBarad-dûr, the Black Gate, and the Towers of the Teeth collapsed to\nruin. The Orcs and other creatures of Sauron were completely\ndirectionless with the Dark Lord's demise and were easily defeated and\ndestroyed by the remaining troops of the Host of the West. Some of the\nEasterlings and Haradrim fought on stalwartly, though eventually many\nthrew down their weapons and surrendered (later to be sent home in peace\nby Aragorn).\n\nThe Rest of the Battle\n\nDespite the destruction of Mordor and its armies, the fight against\nSauron's remaining forces would continue in the northern theater of the\nWar of the Ring for several weeks, notably at Dol Guldur in Mirkwood and\nat The Lonely Mountain, but the power of Sauron, the Dark Lord of\nMordor, was no more.\n\nMonths later, the Battle of Bywater in the Shire against Ruffians men\nled by Saruman, and the subsequent killing of Saruman by Wormtongue who\nthen was later slain, ended the War of the Ring.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nRankin-Bass\n\nThe Return of the King\n\nIn the Rankin-Bass version of _The Return of the King_, Aragorn, now in\nfull command of Gondor's armies, chooses to march on the Black Gate\ndespite the odds. When Aragorn comes to the Black Gate, he calls on the\nDark Lord to come forth and “atone for his evils” and depart these\nlands. The gate opens and the Mouth of Sauron comes out and refutes his\ndemands in an insulting manner. Aragorn refuses to even acknowledge him\nand dismisses him as merely one of Sauron's slaves angering the Mouth.\nThe Mouth rides away laughing in an evil manner. (_The Return of the\nKing (1980 film)_)\n\nPeter Jackson's The Return of the King\n\nIn Peter Jackson's _The Return of the King_ the Slag Hills are absent,\nas is Imrahil. The confrontation with the Mouth of Sauron was cut,\nthough in the extended edition of the film it was put back in, but with\nAragorn decapitating the Mouth of Sauron in anger (in the book the Mouth\nof Sauron rode back to Cirith Gorgor).\n\nIn Jackson's version, the Dark Lieutenant is portrayed as the “Mouth of\nSauron”, a disfigured emissary rather than a soldier. The Mouth at first\nseems angered by what Gandalf says, but then regains his stature and\nspeaks in a mock-friendly manner, calling him “Old Greybeard”. He tells\nGandalf that he has “a token he was bidden to show” and then takes out\nFrodo's mithril vest and throws it at Gandalf. He seems to be getting\nenjoyment out of seeing the shocked and horrified faces of Frodo's\nfriends. Seeking to hurt Gandalf even more, he begins lying about how\nFrodo suffered greatly before dying, and smiles when a tear runs down\nGandalf's face.\n\nAt this, Aragorn approaches on his horse. The Mouth of Sauron seems\nspiteful towards Aragorn, saying that “It takes more to make a king than\na broken elvish blade”. He's then beheaded by Aragorn, an action which\nshocks Gimli, causing him to say sarcastically, “Well, I guess that\nconcludes negotiations!” Aragorn then turns around, saying he does not\nbelieve that Frodo is dead. At this point, Sauron's eye moves towards\nthe Black Gate. The Mouth of Sauron's death was never shown in the book,\nbut rather left his fate unknown.\n\nOriginally, Aragorn was going to fight Sauron, who was to appear in a\nbright blinding light in the form of Annatar, and then was to turn into\nthe armored Sauron from the prologue of the first film, at which Aragorn\nand Sauron would begin to duel. This idea was later dropped to stay more\nconsistent with the battle in the novel; instead Aragorn fights a troll\nin the film, using the same choreography as the Sauron fight, but with a\nTroll replacing Sauron via CGI. In another difference from the book,\nMerry fights in the battle, while in the book he remained in Gondor.\n\nIn the movie, during the last debate Gandalf makes it clear that there\nare a force of ten thousand Orcs at the Black Gate, but the army of Men\nof the West is still unknown, possibly 500 because when one looks at the\ncircle, the Men of the West seem to have about 500 men. The battle\nstarts after Aragorn killing the mouth of Sauron. He gives an epic\nspeech to the small force of men then gets off his horse and they\nprepare for battle:\n\n  \"_Sons of Gondor! Of Rohan! My brothers! I see in your eyes the same\n  fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage\n  of Men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of\n  fellowship, but it is not this day. An hour of wolves and shattered\n  shields when the age of men comes crashing down, but it is not this\n  day! This day we fight! By all that you hold dear good on this earth,\n  I bid you stand, Men of the West!_\n\nA force of 10,000 Orcs surround the Men of the West who after having\nAragorn run towards the enemy lines charge bravely into the Orcs.\nDespite having only about 300 soldiers of Gondor and 200 Rohirrim they\nkill many Orcs while sustaining light casualties, although it later\nbecomes clear that unless the Ring is destroyed they will be completely\nwiped out as their casualties start getting heavy. When Aragorn is being\nstepped on by a troll the One Ring is destroyed and the forces of Mordor\nwere almost completely destroyed with only a few hundred fleeing (the\naforementioned troll being one of the first to take flight. _The Lord of\nthe Rings: The Return of the King_ (2003)"

    "title": "Tengwar",
    "page_id": "827",
    "text": "The TENGWAR, or the FËANORIAN CHARACTERS, was a script invented by\nFëanor, used to write originally a number of the languages of\nMiddle-earth, including Quenya and Sindarin. However, Tengwar can also\nbe used to write other languages, such as English. The word _Tengwar_ is\nQuenya for “letters”. The corresponding singular of the term is\n_tengwarr_, “letter”.\n\n\n\n\nInternal history and terminology\n\nAccording to HoME 11 (Appendix D to _Quendi and Eldar_), Fëanor when he\ncreated his script introduced a change in terminology. He called a\nletter, i.e. a written representation of a spoken phoneme (_tengwë_) a\n_tengwa_. Previously, any letter or symbol had been called a _sarat_\n(from _*sar_ “incise”), especially the alphabet of Rúmil of Valinor on\nwhich Fëanor supposedly based his was known as Sarati, but later also\nknown as “Tengwar of Rúmil”. The plural of _tengwa_ was _Tengwar_, and\nthis is the name by which Fëanor's system became known. Since, however,\nin commonly used modes, an individual _Tengwa_ was equivalent to a\nconsonant, the term _Tengwar_ in popular use became equivalent to\n“consonant sign”, and the vowel signs were known as _ómatehtar_. By\nloan-translation, the Tengwar became known as _tîw_ (singular _têw_) in\nSindarin, when they were introduced to Beleriand. The letters of the\nearlier alphabet native to Sindarin were called _cirth_ (singular\n_certh_, probably from _*kirte_ “cutting”, and thus semantically\nanalogous to Quenya _sarat_). This term was loaned into exilic Quenya as\n_certa_, plural _certar_.\n\n\nExternal history\n\nPrecursors\n\nThe Sarati, described in _Parma Eldalamberon 13_, a script developed by\nJ. R. R. Tolkien in the late 1910s, anticipates many features of the\ntengwar, especially the vowel representation by diacritics (which is\nfound in many Tengwar varieties), different Tengwar shapes and a few\ncorrespondences between sound features and letter shape features (though\ninconsistent).\n\nEven closer to the Tengwar is the Valmaric script, described in _Parma\nEldalamberon 14_, which J. R. R. Tolkien used from about 1922 to 1925.\nIt features many Tengwar shapes, the inherent vowel found in some\nTengwar varieties, and the tables in the samples V12 and V13 show an\narrangement that is very similar to the one of the primary Tengwar in\nthe classical Quenya “mode”.\n\nJim Allan (_An introduction to Elvish_, ISBN 0-905220-10-2) compared the\nTengwar with the _Universal Alphabet_ of Francis Lodwick of 1686, both\non grounds of the correspondence between shape features and sound\nfeatures, and of the actual letter shapes. A corresponance between shape\nfeatures and sound features is also found in the Korean Hangul alphabet.\nIt is not known whether Tolkien was aware of these previous scripts.\nHowever, considering the sarati and the valmaric script, it is\nconceivable that Tolkien developed the idea of a general correspondence\nbetween shape features and sound features by himself.\n\nThe Tengwar\n\nThe Tengwar were probably developed in the late 1920s or in the early\n1930s. _The Lonely Mountain Jar Inscription_, the first published\nTengwar sample, dates to 1937 (_The Hobbit_, most editions). The full\nexplanation of the Tengwar was published in Appendix E of _The Lord of\nthe Rings_ in 1955.\n\nThe _Mellonath Daeron Index of Tengwar Specimina_ (DTS) lists 67 known\nsamples of Tengwar by Tolkien.\n\nThere are only few known samples predating publication of _The Lord of\nthe Rings_ (many of them published posthumously):\n\n-   DTS1 _The Lonely Mountain Jar Inscription_, published 1937\n-   DTS 22 - _Ilbereth's Greeting_ from The Father Christmas Letters,\n    dating to 1937\n-   DTS 50/51 - _Edwin Lowdham's Manuscript_ from The Notion Club Papers\n    has Old English language text written in Tengwar (with a few Adûnaic\n    and Quenya words), dating to 1945/6.\n-   DTS 10 - The Brogan Tengwa-greetings, appearing in _The Letters\n    of J. R. R. Tolkien_, No. 118, tentatively dated to 1948.\n-   The following samples presumably predate the Lord of the Rings, but\n    they were not explicitly dated: DTS 16, DTS 17, DTS 18 - _Elvish\n    Script Sample I, II, III_, with parts of the English poems\n    _Errantry_ and _Bombadil_, first published in the _Silmarillion\n    Calendar 1978_, later in _Pictures by J. R. R. Tolkien_, as well as\n    DTS 23 - _So Lúthien_, a page of the English _Lay of Leithan_ text\n    facsimiled in HoME 3:299.\n\nA few other samples, e.g. a Tengwar mode for Gothic are known to exist,\nbut remain unpublished to date 1.\n\n\nSpelling and pronunciation\n\nModes\n\nJust as with any alphabetic writing system, every specific language\nwritten in Tengwar requires a specific orthography, depending on the\nphonology of that language. These Tengwar orthographies are usually\ncalled _modes_.\n\nSome modes, called _ómatehtar_ (or _vowel tehtar_)\nmodes, represent vowels with diacritics called TEHTAR (“signs”;\ncorresponding singular: _tehta_, “sign”), while other modes, called\n_full writing_ modes, represent vowels by normal letters. Some modes map\nthe basic consonants to , , and , while others use them to represent , ,\nand . Some modes follow pronunciation, while others rather follow\ntraditional orthography. The “full writing” modes are sometimes called\n_Beleriandic modes_ because a well-known “full writing” mode is called\nthe “mode of Beleriand”.\n\nSince the publication of the first official description of the Tengwar\nat the end of _The Lord of the Rings_, others have created modes for\nother languages such as English, Spanish, German, Polish, Esperanto and\nLojban.\n\nTengwar letters\n\nThe most notable characteristic of the Tengwar script is that the shapes\nof the letters correspond to the features of the sounds they represent.\n\nThe letters are constructed by a combination of two basic shapes: a\nvertical STEM (either long or short) and either one or two rounded BOWS\n(which may or may not be underlined, and may be on the left or right of\nthe stem).\n\nThe principal letters are divided into four series (“témar”) that\ncorrespond to the main places of articulation and into six rows\n(“tyeller”) that correspond to the main manners of articulation. Both\nvary among modes.\n\nEach series is headed by the basic signs composed of a vertical stem\ndescending below the line, and a single bow. These basic signs represent\nthe voiceless stop consonants for that series. For the classical Quenya\nmode, they are , , and , and the series are named _tincotéma_,\n_parmatéma_, _calmatéma_, and _quessetéma_, respectively; téma means\n“series” in Quenya.\n\nIn rows of the _general use_, there are the following correspondences\nbetween letter shapes and manners of articulation:\n\n-   Doubling the bow turns the voiceless consonant into a voiced one.\n-   Raising the stem above the line turns it into the corresponding\n    fricative.\n-   Shortening it (so it is only the height of the bow) creates the\n    corresponding nasal. It must be noted though that in most modes, the\n    signs with shortened stem and single bow don't correspond to the\n    voiceless nasals, but to the approximants.\n\nHere is an example from the parmatéma (the signs with a closed bow on\nthe right side) in the general use:\n\n-   The basic sign (with descending stem) represents (it happens to look\n    much like the letter _p_).\n-   With the bow doubled, it represents .\n-   With a raised stem, it represents .\n-   With a raised stem and a doubled bow, it represents .\n-   With a short stem and double bow, it represents .\n-   With short stem and single bow, it represents .\n\nIn the classical Quenya mode, the rows are used differently:\n\n-   With descending stem and double bow, we have .\n-   With raised stem and double bow, we have .\n\nThere are additional letters that don't have regular shapes. They may\nrepresent e.g. , , and . Their use varies considerably from mode to\nmode. Some aficionados have added more letters not found in Tolkien's\nwritings for use in their modes.\n\n\nEncoding schemes\n\nNon-Unicode\n\nThe contemporary de facto standard in the Tengwar user community maps\nthe Tengwar characters onto the ISO 8859-1 character encoding following\nthe example of the Tengwar typefaces by Dan Smith. This implies a major\nflaw: if no corresponding tengwar font is installed, an awful string of\nnonsense characters appears.\n\nSince there are not enough places in ISO 8859-1's 191 codepoints for all\nthe signs used in Tengwar orthography, certain signs are included in a\n“Tengwar A” font which also maps its characters on ISO 8859-1,\noverlapping with the first font.\n\nFor each Tengwar diacritic, there are four different codepoints that are\nused depending on the width of the character which bears it.\n\nOther Tengwar typefaces with this encoding include Johan Winge's Tengwar\nAnnatar, Måns Björkman's Tengwar Parmaite, Enrique Mombello's Tengwar\nÉlfica or Michal Nowakowski's Tengwar Formal (note that most of these\ndiffer in details).\n\nThe following sample shows the first article of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights written in English, according to the\ntraditional English orthography. It should look similar to the picture\nat the top of the page, but if no Tengwar font is installed, it will\nlook a random jumble of characters because the corresponding ISO 8859-1\ncharacters will appear instead.\n\n  j#¸ 9t&5# w`Vb%_ 6EO w6Y5 e7~V 2{( zèVj# 5% 2x%51T`Û 2{( 7v%1+º 4hR\n  7EO 2{$yYO2 y4% 7]F85^ 2{( z5^8i`B5$i( 2{( dyYj2 zE1 1`N ]Fa 4^(6 5%\n  `C 8q7T1T W w74^(69~N2º\n\nUnicode\n\nA proposal has been made to include the Tengwar in the Unicode standard.\n\nThe following Unicode sample is meaningful when viewed under a typeface\nsupporting Tengwar glyphs in the area defined in the Tengwar proposal\nfor the ConScript Unicode Registry (U+E000–U+E006F; see External links).\n\nAt the moments, the only typefaces that support this proposal are James\nKass' Code2000 and Code2001 (see also the Tengwar Telcontar Unicode\nfont).\n\nThe following sample repeats the above one according to the Unicode\nproposal.

    "page_id": "862",
    "text": "The WAR OF WRATH, also called the GREAT BATTLE, was the war of Elves,\nMen, Dwarves and Valar against Morgoth at the end of the First Age,\nwhich marked the end of his rule in Middle-earth. It was the largest\nbattle of the First Age and possibly the largest battle ever to have\ntaken place in Middle-earth. It resulted in the expulsion of Morgoth\nfrom Arda and the ruin of the Thangorodrim, but the violence of the\nclashes between the forces of the Valar and Morgoth shattered the\nnorthwestern portion of Middle-earth, Beleriand, and caused it to sink\nbeneath the ocean.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nBy the early sixth century of the First Age, Morgoth's dominion had\nbecome completely uncontested in Middle-earth. The power of the Elves,\nMen, and Dwarves to resist him had been utterly destroyed, and all the\ngreat kingdoms of the Elves had been overthrown. Morgoth was now master\nof nearly all of Beleriand, save for the havens in Arvernien, which he\ngave little heed to. To make matters worse, and to the great amusement\nof Morgoth, the Sons of Fëanor, seeking the Silmaril of Beren and\nLúthien, had launched two devastatingly brutal Kinslayings in which they\nhad destroyed both Doriath and the Havens of Sirion. In this time of\nneed, the mariner Eärendil, by the guidance of a Silmaril which he wore\non his forehead, searched for and came to Valinor on behalf of Elves and\nMen. There, he begged the Valar to pardon and aid the overmatched\npeoples of Middle-earth.\n\nThe Battle\n\nDespite having pledged to leave the Ñoldor to reap the bitter harvest of\ntheir folly in pursuing Morgoth, Manwë was moved by Eärendil's plea.\nAlong with the Vanyar and the remaining Ñoldor in Aman, the host of the\nValar came to Middle-earth in the mightiest gathering of arms in the\nhistory of Arda. The Teleri of Alqualondë granted the use of their ships\nto ferry the hosts of Aman to Middle-earth, but they remembered still\nthe Kinslaying of their people long ago and harbored much bitterness\nover it. As such, they sent only what mariners were needed to man the\nships, and none of them set foot on Middle-earth once they arrived. The\ngreat force of Aman marched across Beleriand, and met the armies of\nMorgoth in the plains of Anfauglith. Morgoth marshaled the entirety of\nhis forces, which had by this point grown so vast that Anfauglith could\nnot contain their numbers.\n\nThough the war lasted for over 40 years, the host of the Valar utterly\ndestroyed the Orc armies of Morgoth, as well as most of the Balrogs.\nWhile the Three Houses of Men fought alongside the Valar, many other Men\nfrom the East fought for the forces of Morgoth and were either destroyed\nor forced to flee back to the far eastern parts of Middle-earth. Facing\nfinal defeat, Morgoth released his ultimate weapon, the winged Dragons,\nwhich had never been seen before. Their terrible onslaught was\naccompanied by lightning storms and tempests of fire, and they drove the\nValar back and nearly destroyed the host of the West.\n\n\n\nFortunately, Eärendil came with his sky-ship Vingilot, along with the\nEagles of Manwë led by Thorondor. In the skies above Angband, they\nconfronted the dragons, and Eärendil himself slew their captain, the\nmighty Ancalagon the Black, who broke the towers of Thangorodrim in his\nfall. Angband was then leveled and Morgoth was finally captured in the\ndeepest of his mines. He sued for peace and pardon, but he was bound\nagain with the old chain Angainor and the two Silmarils still in his\npossession were taken by the Maia Eönwë, the herald of Manwë. Morgoth\nwas taken to Aman and tried for his crimes. In the end, the Valar\nun-housed Morgoth by beheading him and “thrust him through the Door of\nNight”, beyond the Walls of the World, into the Timeless Void, the doors\nof which are forever guarded by Ëarendil.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe geographical wreckage of the war was immense; most of the land west\nof the Blue Mountains was destroyed and sank beneath the waves. Though\nit is not known exactly how many casualties the Host of the West\nendured, the war dragged on for decades before they managed to approach\nAngband, and the attack of Morgoth's winged dragons was known to have\nbeen nearly catastrophic for the forces of the Valar. While the hosts of\nMorgoth were utterly defeated, the creatures that composed them were not\neradicated, and many (particularly Orcs) remained to trouble the world\nunder the power of Sauron. Additionally, it was noted that a few Balrogs\nfled and hid deep in the Earth, though only one, known by the title of\nDurin's Bane, was ever noted by history to have appeared again. Some\nnumber of dragons, particularly Cold-drakes, also hid themselves away in\nthe mountains. These dragons bred over time, and became particularly\ntroublesome for the Dwarves in ages to come. Nearly all of the winged\nFire-drakes were destroyed by Ëarendil, Thorondor and his Eagles, but\nsome managed to escape, as at least one of the species, Smaug the\nGolden, was known to have been active during the Third Age.\n\nThe remaining Elves were bidden by Ëonwë to return with him to the lands\nof Aman. Most of the Elves went into the West, while others still\nrefused the summons and rather journeyed eastward where they would\nbecome lords of the remaining Eldar or those Elves who still dwelt in\nthe East. Gil-galad, Galadriel, Celeborn, and Elrond were chief among\nthese. Additionally, the victory was made even more bitter by the loss\nof the Silmarils. Maedhros and Maglor, the two surviving sons of Fëanor,\nwere compelled by their oath to recover the gems. Though sick at heart\nat the burden of the terrible oath, they conspired to sneak into the\ncamp of the victorious Host of the Valar, where they slew the guard\naround the Silmarils and took them. The camp was roused against them,\nand though they were prepared to fight to the death to keep the gems,\nthey were permitted to go. But they soon discovered that, due to the\nwicked deeds they had performed in recovering the jewels, first among\nthem the three Kinslayings, they could not hold the Silmarils without\nsuffering terrible pain. And so Maedhros cast himself and the Silmaril\nhe bore into a fiery pit, and Maglor threw his into the Sea. And so both\nwere lost to the Host of the Valar, and they returned to Aman empty\nhanded.\n\nFor those men of the Edain who fought for the host of the Valar, the\nland of Númenor (in the full Quenya form Nùmenórë) was given to them.\nThis land was neither of Aman nor of Middle-earth, but was closer to\nAman.\n\n\nTrivia\n\nA prophecy given in _Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth_ in _Morgoth's Ring_\ngives the slaying of Ancalagon to Túrin instead of Ëarendil. It is also\nnot stated how exactly Eärendil managed to slay Ancalagon. This is\nsomething of a curiosity considering that Ancalagon's size was great\nenough to break the three mountains of Thangorodrim when he fell upon\nthem, each of which were stated to be 5 miles across and 35,000 feet\nhigh. It must be noted, however, that Durin’s Bane caused considerable\ndamage to a mountain upon crashing to his death despite being only 12-15\nfeet tall. This indicates certain beings could cause far more damage on\nimpact than one would assume."

It had many\ndifferent groups who ultimately fought together and were in Sauron's\nservice.\n\n\nOverview\n\n“Rhûn” is a name used for all lands lying east of Rhovanion, around and\nbeyond the inland Sea of Rhûn, from where many attacks on Gondor and its\nallies came during the Third Age.\n\nWe know almost nothing of the lands beyond the great Sea of Rhûn that\nstood on its borders with the western lands. Even Gandalf had never\nexplored there, and although Aragorn visited once, his activities are\nnot recounted.\n\nOf its ancient geography we can glean a little from _The Silmarillion_;\nfar beyond the Sea of Rhûn was another inland sea, the Sea of Helcar,\nand beyond that a range of mountains known as the Orocarni (Red\nMountains). Somewhere in the lost east, too, lay Cuiviénen and\nHildórien, where Elves and Men first awoke: all the Children of Ilúvatar\ncould trace their ancestries back to the eastward regions of\nMiddle-earth.\n\nEasterlings were a race of Men of Darkness who were ready to follow both\nDark Lords and fought as their allies in war in different parts of\nhistory.\n\nDuring the Third Age, Rhûn was visited by three Wizards; Saruman,\nAlatar, and Pallando, and though Saruman returned to the west, the two\nBlue Wizards remained. Their fates are unknown and whether they were\nsuccessful in inspiring the peoples they had contact with to resist\nSauron's influence is unknown. Sauron himself journeyed into the\neastward lands, in hiding from the White Council during the centuries\nknown in the west as the Watchful Peace.\n\nThe land of Dorwinion lay in Rhûn, and the Easterlings of the Balchoth\nand Wainriders lived there.\n\nGondor conquered western edge of Rhûn twice: under the Kings Rómendacil\nI and Rómendacil II, but the Númenóreans never had full control over it.\n\nThe people of Rhûn were finally subdued in the Fourth Age under King\nElessar (Aragorn) and his son Eldarion. King Elessar eventually made\npeace with the Easterlings, and they were allowed to remain in Rhûn.\n\n\nTrade\n\nIt is possible that colossal quantities of ore and other critical raw\nmaterials were shipped from Rhûnic mines in the eastern territories and\nthe Orocarni mountain range to the Black Land.\n\nIn times of peace (or unstable lulls between Easterling attacks), the\nMen of Rhûn traded their products to their erstwhile enemies as well. As\nseen in ''The Hobbit, ''a number of Elvish guardsmen in the cellar of\nKing Thranduil's subterranean palace drank themselves into a stupor and\nblindly let Bilbo Baggins and his Dwarf companions escape down the River\nRunning to Lake-town. The massive, wild white Kine of Araw (from which\nBoromir's Horn of Gondor was crafted) would also prove to provide a\nsource of rare, sumptuous, and mouth-watering meat that was famed around\nthe land and was greatly desired by the monarchs of every sort of\nkingdom, from the Elvenking to the Steward of Gondor.\n\n\nGeography\n\nThe western part of Rhûn was given in maps of the Westlands of\nMiddle-earth. It contained the great Sea of Rhûn, connected the River\nRunning in the northwest. A forest lay to the north-east of the Sea, and\nnear the south-western shores, there were many hills. South-west of the\nSea of Rhûn lay also the land of Dorwinion.\n\nThe Inland Sea of Rhûn was located in western Rhûn on the border between\nRhûn and Wilderland. There were mountains on the southwest side of the\nSea of Rhûn and a forest on the north-east side. Wild white Kine of\nAraw, or oxen, lived near the shores of the Sea of Rhûn.\n\nFurther east in Rhûn were ancient regions where the Children of Ilúvatar\nfirst awoke: Cuiviénen for the Elves, which lay on the shores of Sea of\nHelcar near the Orocarni (Red Mountains); and Hildórien for Men. Four\nDwarven clans were also located in Rhûn (Orocarni); their mansions were\nat least as far east from Mount Gundabad in the Misty Mountains as Mount\nGundabad lay east of the Blue Mountains. Additionally, Sauron maintained\na fortress in Rhûn in the Third Age.\n\nThe Dwarves of Rhûn\n\nDwarves emerged in Middle-earth in the Years of the Trees: after Elves\nbut before Men. When the seven Fathers of the Dwarves awoke in far-flung\ncorners of Middle-earth, some of them found themselves in Rhûn, and\nthere they founded kingdoms under the mountains of Orocarni. The\nfollowing clans are the Houses that resided in the Orocarni: Ironfists,\nStiffbeards, Blacklocks, Stonefoots. In the Third Age, Dwarves of those\nkingdoms journeyed out of Rhûn to join all Middle-earth's other Dwarf\nclans in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, which was fought in and under\nthe Misty Mountains. After this war, the survivors returned home. Late\nin the Third Age, when war and terror grew in Rhûn itself, considerable\nnumbers of its Dwarves left their ancient homelands. They sought refuge\nin Middle-earth's western lands, where some of them met Frodo Baggins.\n\n\n\nMilitary\n\nRhûn was known for numerous fighting forces, nearly spelling the doom of\nGondor and almost heralding Sauron's complete victory over the entirety\nof Middle-earth. (See the article entitled “Easterlings” for a complete\ndigest of their military structure.) However, we can assume that their\nmilitary was not of the quality of the three houses of the Edain.\nBecause of their distance from the high culture of the Eldar, their\nweaponry and armor would most likely be inferior to that of their Edain\nbrothers that were armed by the Elves of Beleriand. On their other hand,\ntheir work with Morgoth's Orcs would place them in a position to utilize\nhis weaponry after large losses and attrition.\n\nThe main weapon of the infantry of Rhûn that marched upon Gondor seemed\nto be the spear although there were reports of short, swarthy men\nwielding axes during Battle of the Pelennor Fields.\n\nHowever, they are not all footmen. In the books, they are described as\nhaving bowmen upon horses and then they are described as companies of\nhorsemen. Both the Wainriders and the Balchoth also used chariots. These\nwere supremely effective in the flat no-man's lands that characterized\nmuch of Rhovanion in the wide corridor between the southern eaves of\nMirkwood and the northern flanks of Mordor, routing and destroying the\narmies of Gondor under King Narmacil II in the Battle of the Plains.\nThey were to take a considerable toll on the Eotheod as well.\n\nThe Easterlings that fought in the War of the Ring established and built\non the solid foundation of military excellence and fearsome savagery\nthat characterized their all-conquering ancestors. Often, the\nEasterlings in a mixed contingent of Orcs, Haradrim, Variags, Corsairs,\nor Uruk-hai would be the first to clash with the enemy and the last to\nleave the field. The Rhûnic tradition of bravery and self-sacrifice was\nimbued within every warrior of Rhûn, instilling him with a concoction of\nbloodlust and fury that would ensure that he fought to the last. As\nevidenced in countless battles during the Third Age, the Easterlings\nwould always stand their ground and fight to the last man unless ordered\notherwise. This was proven in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. The\nEasterlings' resolve to fight to the death was also exemplified the next\nday when the tables turned against Sauron. While the host of Mordor\ndropped their weapons, shed their armor, and fled en masse across the\nbridge to Osgiliath, the host of the Easterlings halted with their backs\nto the River Anduin and stood their ground. None survived, despite\ninflicting numerous casualties upon their hated enemies.\n\nThe vast Rhûnic army that besieged Dale and the Lonely Mountains in TA\n3019 most likely had a sizable support element traveling along with\nthem, for one does not simply win a siege with footmen. It is likely\nthat the siege weapons brought along by the Easterlings differed greatly\nfrom their primitive and savage Orc allies.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe first Elves awoke far east of the Sea of Rhûn, and many of them were\nled to the Westlands by Oromë. Some Elves forsook this Great Journey and\nchose to remain in the east; they were called the Avari.\n\nThe first Men also awoke in the far east, where they first met\nDwarves and Avari. The ancestors of the Edain and Drúedain traveled\nwest out of Rhûn. At the shores of the Sea of Rhûn, some of the Mannish\ntribes traveling west separated and their languages soon diverged.\nOther men remained in Rhûn, and many of them came under the dominion of\nMorgoth and, later, Sauron. These men were called Easterlings, and they\nled many attacks against Gondor and its allies during the Third Age.\n\nThe most western parts of Rhûn were conquered by Gondor twice, under the\nKings Rómendacil I and Rómendacil II, but the Númenóreans never had full\ncontrol over it. Western Rhûn was finally subdued in the Fourth Age\nunder King Elessar and his son Eldarion.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name Rhûn is Sindarin for 'east', as opposed to the Quenya _romen_.\nLikewise, Harad means 'south' in Sindarin, Forod means north, and Dûn\nmeans west."

    "text": "'''Orthanc '''was the black, impenetrable tower of Isengard built by the\nDúnedain. By the Great Years and the War of the Ring it was possessed by\nthe wizard Saruman the White. It stood in the centre of the Ring of\nIsengard, surrounded by great defensive walls fortified by the early Men\nof Gondor.\n\n\nDescription\n\n''“A great ring-wall of stone, like towering cliffs, stood out from the\nshelter of the mountain-side, from which it ran and then returned\nagain... one who passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel,\nbeheld a plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed like a vast shallow\nbowl: a mile it measured from rim to rim. Once it had been green and\nfilled with avenues, and groves of fruitful trees, watered by streams\nthat flowed from the mountains to a lake. But no green thing grew there\nin the latter days of Saruman. The roads were paved with stone-flags\ndark and hard; and beside their borders instead of trees there marched\nlong lines of pillars, some of marble, some of copper and of iron,\njoined by heavy chains, to the centre all the roads ran between their\nchains. There stood a tower of marvelous shape. It was fashioned by the\nbuilders of old, who smoothed the Ring of Isengard, and yet it seemed a\nthing not made by the craft of Men, but riven from the bones of the\nearth in the ancient torment of the hills. A peak and isle of rock it\nwas, black and gleaming hard: four mighty piers of many-sided stone were\nwelded into one, but near the summit they opened into gaping horns,\ntheir pinnacles sharp as the points of spears, keen-edged as knives.\nBetween them was a narrow space, and there upon a floor of polished\nstone, written with strange signs, a man might stand five hundred feet\nabove the plain.” ''\n\n- Orthanc as depicted by J.R.R Tolkien\n\nThe tower was constructed out of four piers of stone and then hardened\nby an unknown process. No weaponry or magic that existed on Arda was\nknown to be able to harm it. Until the Ents that besieged Isengard\nduring the War of the Ring managed to inflict slight damage on the\ntower, but their efforts ultimately proved to be futile. When Grima\nthrew the Orthanc stone it fell on the stairs; the rail snapped and part\nof the staircase broke.\n\nThe only entrance to the tower was reached by a stair of twenty-seven\nsteps, the door could only be opened with the Keys of Orthanc. Above the\ndoor there was a balcony, and many tall windows higher up.\n\n\nHistory\n\nSecond Age\n\n\n\nThe exact date of construction of Orthanc and establishment of Isengard\nis unknown; however it must have been built between SA 3320, the time of\nthe establishment of Arnor and Gondor, and SA 3430, when the Last\nAlliance of Elves and Men was formed. Within the fortified walls of the\ntower was placed one of the Palantíri, the Stone of Orthanc. Thus,\nOrthanc was now known as one of the seven towers of the Dúnedain,\nhousing the seventh seeing stone brought back from Númenor by Elendil.\n\nThird Age\n\nOrthanc suffered greatly during the Great Plague of TA 1636, and many of\nthe Númenóreans that inhabited it gradually migrated eastward.\nEventually the tower itself became deserted and its keys being moved to\nMinas Tirith to be kept by the Stewards of Gondor.\n\nAfter the Battle of the Field of Celebrant in TA 2510, a small group of\nMen of Gondor travelled to Isengard and maintained the fortress on their\nown. However, the Keys of Orthanc still officially belonged to the\nStewards of Gondor.\n\nOver time, Orthanc lost its connections with Minas Tirith and the Men of\nGondor failed to maintain the tower successfully. The Dunlendings then\ntook over the fortress and launched many attacks on the Westfold. In the\nLong Winter of TA 2754, the Dunlendings were eventually starved out due\nto the famine caused by the lack of communication to all food suppliers.\nThen Saruman put in an offer for the control of Isengard and both King\nFréaláf and Steward Beren embraced the proposition with open arms. Thus,\nthe wizard was handed the keys to Orthanc.\n\n\n\nAfter gaining the control of Isengard, Saruman became greatly interested\nin the Rings of Power and began to especially desire the One. He thought\nthat if he gave time for Sauron to regain some strength, the ring would\nreveal itself to him. Therefore, as head of the White Council, Saruman\noverruled Gandalf's call for an attack on Dol Guldur, the Dark Lord's\nthen current fortress. However in TA 2941, he did agree on the attack\nwhen he found out that the servants of Sauron were searching for the\nring near the Gladden Fields.\n\n\n\nLater, Saruman's mind was corrupted and fell under the control of Sauron\nwhen he used the Stone of Orthanc—the seventh Palantiri—for the first\ntime.\n\nIn TA 3018, Gandalf rode to Isengard to meet with Saruman. It was then\nthat the wizard declared his true thoughts regarding his desire to be\nruler of Men, to possess the Ring, and to join Sauron in his evil deeds.\nGandalf refused Saruman's offer to join him and Sauron. Subsequently,\nthe wizard held Gandalf captive on Orthanc's pinnacle until he submitted\nin telling the location of the One Ring. After many weeks of\nimprisonment, Gwaihir, the Lord of the Eagles, came unlooked for and\nbore him away.\n\nOnly months later, the Ents of Fangorn Forest launched their attack on\nIsengard. By the next day, only the tower of Orthanc remained, as it was\nhewn of one piece of impenetrable rock, and the plains below had been\ncompletely destroyed, leaving a desolate land of water and mud. Three\ndays after the battle, Theoden, Éomer, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and\nGimli approached Orthanc past a desolation of wreckage caused by the\nEnts including a huge blood-ridden white hand, and climbed its stair.\nThey parleyed with Saruman, who remained inside the tower and spoke to\nthem from a balcony above the door. After Saruman refused to cooperate\nand attempted to control the Rohirrim riding with them, Gandalf cast him\nfrom the Order of Wizards and the White Council, breaking Saruman's\nStaff. After the confrontation, Grima Wormtongue—who was inside the\ntower at the time—threw the Stone of Orthanc at the party outside as a\nparting shot.\n\nFourth Age\n\n\n\nOne of King Elessar's first tasks he had set was the restoration of\nOrthanc. He ordered that the Palantir should be recovered and returned\nto the tower. Then Orthanc was searched and many secrets were revealed.\nIt was clear that Saruman had been hoarding many ancient treasures and\nheirlooms during his time there. With the aid of Wormtongue, Saruman had\nacquired many jewels and heirlooms belonging to Eorl. Soon a hidden door\nwas found and inside a casket they found two precious objects: one of\nwhich was a small gold case attached to a chain - this was used by\nIsildur to bear the One Ring; and second of which was the Elendilmir -\nthe 'white star of Elvish crystal upon a fillet of mithril' that had\nbeen lost since Isildur's demise. Elessar received the Elendilmir with\nreverence and took it with him as he established his full kingship of\nArnor. It was revealed that Saruman had found the remains of Isildur and\nhad burned them.\n\nOrthanc and the plains of Isengard around it remained part of the\nReunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor. However, King Elessar granted the\nEnts complete self-governance of the area surrounding the tower. This\nnew forest became known as the Treegarth of Orthanc.\n\n\nPinnacle of Orthanc\n\n\n\nThe Pinnacle of Orthanc was the summit of Saruman's tower. Its corners\nwere razor-edged points with room for at least two men to stand. It was\naccessed by a flight of thousands of stairs, which Saruman would use to\nreach the top and observe the stars.\n\nIt was here where Saruman imprisoned Gandalf at the start of the War of\nthe Ring, which caused him to be delayed in meeting with Frodo. He was\nrescued by the Great Eagle Gwaihir, sent by Radagast the Brown.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nAccording to Tolkien, its name is both Sindarin for “Mount Fang”, and\nRohirric for “Cunning Mind”. The latter is more likely to be its real\nmeaning, as the word _Orthanc_ is a real Old English word (Old English\nbeing the linguistic basis for Rohirric); the Sindarin name being no\nmore than a poetic coincidence. In Old English, Orþanc means “cunning\ndevice”, but Tolkien has said this is merely a coincidence."

    "text": "The BLACK NÚMENÓREANS were a fallen group of Númenóreans who were\ndescended from those loyal to the Númenórean crown but opposed to the\nValar and relations with the Elves. They listened to the words of\nSauron. Soon they were corrupted by him, and would come to worship the\nDarkness and Morgoth.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nSecond Age\n\nOrigins\n\nAs the power and knowledge of the Númenóreans grew throughout the course\nof the Second Age, they became increasingly preoccupied with the limits\nplaced on their contentment in the world - and eventually their power -\nby mortality, the purpose of which they began to question.\n\nAs time went on they began to fear death more and more and ultimately\nwished to escape it. So the Númenóreans became envious of the immortal\nElves (the Eldar), whom they had come to physically resemble as part of\ntheir reward from Ilúvatar for having been their allies. The Eldar\nsought ever to remind the Men of Númenor however, that death was a gift\nfrom Ilúvatar to all Men, and to lose faith in Ilúvatar would be\nheretical.\n\nNevertheless, after SA 2221, when Tar-Ancalimon became King of Númenor.\nThe 'King's Men' therefore became increasingly predisposed to the\ncorruption of Sauron after he came to Númenor.\n\nEventually, in Númenor's last years, its hugely powerful but elderly\nKing Ar-Pharazôn, who had become “frightened of old age” (_Letters_,\nno.156), was persuaded by Sauron that Ilúvatar was a lie invented by the\nValar, and seduced him. Within Númenor, the majority immediately\nfollowed suit, and this worship quickly passed across the ocean when\nthey sailed eastwards from Númenor, to most of Númenor's colonies in\nMiddle-earth where the group started in proper.\n\nThe group thrived in Middle-earth, particularly in Umbar after the\ndestruction of Númenor. They continued to oppose The Faithful, from\nwhich came the Kings of Arnor and Gondor, the Black Númenóreans remained\nloyal towards Sauron.\n\nThree of the Ringwraiths can be considered among the first and most\npowerful Númenóreans who were corrupted by Sauron, 1000 years before the\nDownfall: they served Sauron, being enslaved to his will, having become\nso because of their lust for power or knowledge.\n\nThese sacrilegious 'black arts' and 'follies', which arose as a\nconsequence of their worship of 'The Dark' and Melkor, marked the final,\nirrevocable division between the 'King's Men' and the minority known as\nthe 'Faithful' Númenóreans, or the 'Elendili', who kept to their old\nfaith in Ilúvatar. They were also presumably the earliest culture traits\nof those who became known afterwards as Black Númenóreans.\n\nAfter the Fall of Númenor\n\nFor many centuries after the Downfall, descendants of the 'King's Men'\nheld onto colonies in Middle-earth, what became the most northerly and\nfamous of their Realms in Exile, Umbar.\n\nMost of those few Númenóreans who had never disavowed the Eldar, and had\nalways remained true to their belief in Ilúvatar, also survived the\ndestruction of their homeland, and they established their own Realms in\nExile north of Umbar, in familiar and friendly colonies. The Faithful\nNúmenóreans saw their southern counterparts as renegades. The Black\nNúmenóreans held a similarly low opinion of 'The Faithful' and their\ndescendants.\n\nOnly two Black Númenórean lords are named from the time of the late\nSecond Age: Herumor and Fuinur. Like all Black Númenóreans and 'King's\nMen' before them, Herumor and Fuinur desired power over men of other,\n lesser races, and they “rose to (great)\npower amongst the Haradrim”, the peoples neighbouring Umbar. Their fate\nis unknown, but they were likely defeated along with Sauron at the War\nof the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.\n\nThird Age\n\nThe Black Númenórean style of rule was no doubt tyrannical, but may also\nhave involved a tradition of duumviracy, at least in Umbar, whose lords\nare usually paired when mentioned; Herumor/Fuinur for example, were\nprobably rulers of Umbar, as much later Angamaitë/Sangahyando were.\nWhatever political system was in place, however, the Black Númenóreans\ndid not govern effectively.\n\nThe triumph of the Last Alliance marked the decline of the Black\nNúmenórean race and the end of their racial superiority. Nevertheless,\nthe Black Númenórean elite survived at least in Umbar for over a\nthousand years after Númenor's fall, maintaining much influence in\nHaradwaith. As late as Angamaitë for example, even after being exiled\nfrom their homeland for nearly a century.\n\nBlack Numenoreans in the 3rd age eventually joined The Witch King of\nAngmar in his conquests of Arnor. The fate of the Black Numenoreans of\nAngmar is unknown, but it's most likely they either all died or\ndisbanded after the Battle of Fornost.\n\nThe Black Númenóreans did not use Westron, but probably retained their\nold tongue Adûnaic, speaking a dialect of it. (In The Notion Club\nPapers, part of Sauron Defeated, Arundel Lowdham cited two descendants\nof classical Adûnaic. One of these must have been Westron, the other the\ntongue of the Black Númenóreans (Black Adûnaic?).\n\nThe Black Númenóreans are absent from recorded history after their\ndefeat by Ciryaher in TA 1050, but a  population of sorts must have survived somewhere at least\nuntil the end of the Third Age, as the Mouth of Sauron, who mocked the\narmy of King Elessar in front of the Black Gate was described both as a\nBlack Númenórean and “Renegade”, which is presumably the term used by\nthe Free Peoples of that time to describe all folk of similar ancestry.\n\nIn one of his letters, Tolkien wrote that Queen Berúthiel, wife of\nGondor's King Tarannon Falastur was a Black Númenórean, from a Black\nNúmenórean realm he describes as “the inland city” somewhere south of\nUmbar. This was a loveless union, and was presumably a political\naccommodation: that such arrangements were possible implies the\nexistence at that time of more Gondor-friendly Black Númenóreans than\nthe much later Mouth of Sauron.\n\n\nPortrayal in Adaptations\n\nVideo games\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings Online_, the Black Númenóreans are in the\nservice of the Angmarim and live in Carn Dûm in Angmar and served\nMordirith and later Amarthiel.\n\nIn _The Lord of the Rings: War in the North_, Agandaûr was a Black\nNúmenórean and the game's main enemy.\n\nIn the story-line of _The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth\nII: The Rise of the Witch-king_, the Black Númenóreans were conquered\nand subjected by the Witch-king, and serve as Angmar's elite units. They\nare portrayed as wearing fearsome iron masks, proud of their heritage as\n“the King's Men”. They are split into Thrall Masters, Swordsmen, Dark\nRangers and Sorcerers of the Temple of Twilight. Angmar is portrayed as\na frozen wasteland, with units including the Black Númenóreans focusing\nupon this aspect in terms of clothing and weaponry. \n\n\nNotable Black Númenóreans\n\n-   Mouth of Sauron\n-   Agandaûr (Non-canonical)\n-   Wulfrun (Non-canonical)\n-   Dol Guldur Mouth (Non-canonical)\n-   Carn Dûm Captain (Non-canonical)\n-   Black Hand (Non-canonical)\n-   Hammer of Sauron (Non-canonical)\n-   Tower of Sauron (Non-canonical)\n\n\nTrivia\n\nIn _The Third Age: Total War_ (A _Medieval II Total War_ modification),\nthe Black Númenóreans are an elite bodyguard and soldier unit, either\nmounted or dismounted. They can do far more damage than Uruk-hai\nBerserkers, Troll-men of Harad, or Arnor Longswordmen put together."

    "text": "DUNLENDINGS, also known as\nWILDMEN OF DUNLAND, were the people of Dunland. They were known as a\nfierce culture of Men who sought vengeance on the people of Rohan who,\nas Saruman rightly said, drove them into the mountains. In _The Two\nTowers_, Saruman used their anger to manipulate and convince them to\ndestroy the land of Rohan during the War of the Ring. He sends them\nacross Rohan, burning and looting the land.\n\nDunlending Wildmen come from the land of Dunland. When looting Rohan\nearlier in the Third Age, they are led by a Dunlending named Wulf son of\nFreca.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nIn the years of the Second Age before the Númenóreans settled in\nMiddle-earth, the tribal Hill-men inhabited the lands west and south of\nthe Misty Mountains, as far down as the valleys surrounding the White\nMountains.\n\nWary of the men who came out of the west, they came to fear and hate\nthem. They were hunted and persecuted in such numbers that they had\ndwindled by the start of the Third Age. At this time they had come to\ncongregate in the valleys of the White Mountains and the grassy plains\nof Dunland, which lay west of the Misty Mountains between Moria and\nIsengard; a few went north, and became the ancestors of the Men of Bree.\nDunland then became the area most populated by these men, who came to be\ncalled Dunlendings.\n\n\n\nWhen Eorl and his people were granted Calenardhon --- Rohan, as it would\nlater be known --- in TA 2510, they drove the Wild Men from their new\nlands, earning their bitter hatred and enmity. The Wild Men were also\ndriven from the White Mountains by the Men of Gondor. During the next\nfive hundred years these shorter, dark-haired warriors made frequent\nattacks upon the outlying settlements of Rohan, exacting revenge upon\nthe usurpers, whom they called “straw-heads” because of the high number\nof blond warriors among them.\n\nAs a consequence, Rohan maintained patrols and garrisons to the west of\nthe Fords of Isen to try to limit the number of raids, although these\npatrols had virtually disappeared under Wormtongue's stewardship, to the\npoint where Saruman's forces could make incursions almost at will.\n\nYet not everybody took against the Wild Men. At some point near the end\nof the thirtieth century of the Third Age, Saruman made contact with\nthem and swayed them to his side by playing on their resentment and\nhatred of those who had taken what was theirs.\n\nSaruman welcomed to Orthanc a large warband of these Dunlendings.\nSaruman evidently convinced them that they could reclaim what had been\ntaken, and during the early part of TA 3019, a fearsome raiding force\ncomprising Dunlendings, Orcs and Uruk-hai left Isengard and began\nravaging the western settlements of Rohan. Previous attacks by Orcs and\nUruk-hai had killed many Rohirrim at the Fords of Isen, so there were no\nwarriors to defend against the surprise attack.\n\n\n\nMany people of Rohan were killed in these attacks, but the raiders never\nmade it across the country to Edoras; it is fair to assume that they\nencountered one or more Éoreds, companies of mounted warriors, who would\nhave been patrolling the interior. After the defeat of Isengard at the\nBattle of the Hornburg, the Rohirrim spared the surviving Dunlendings\nand used them as workmen to repair the broken walls of the Hornburg.\n\nThe Rohirrim's mercy surprised the Dunlendings, as Saruman had convinced\nthem the Rohirrim would slaughter them all if given the chance. When\nGandalf, Frodo Baggins, Sam Gamgee, Merry Brandybuck, and Pippin Took\nwere traveling through Dunland on their way back towards the the Shire,\nthe Dunlendings in that area hid from them. After the War of the Ring,\nthe Dunlendings sent ambassadors to the court of King Aragorn, thus\nfinally began peace and diplomacy between Gondor and Rohan with the\nDunlending realms.\n\n\n\n\nCulture\n\nThe Dunlendings were hill-folk used to living in harsh conditions, often\nseen in leather garb and fur cloaks. They may have been related to the\nSnowmen of Forochel in the north. They were a tough, hardy people, big\nand powerful with long, unkempt hair and beards. The Dunlendings,\nbecause they lived in the hilly and forested area of Dunland, most\nlikely hunted, foraged, and fished for food, with agriculture being a\nlesser form of food production.\n\nThe Dunlendings, due to their way of life, probably were very skilled\nwith bows. Dunlendings are also described as using cavalry at the Fords\nof Isen. Most Dunlendings probably fought, however, on foot, with long\nspears, axes and other melee weapons (as with most self-arming forces,\nswords were expensive and therefore a rarity).  Armour for most soldiers\nwas light, but well-off warriors and chieftains likely made use of\nchainmail and were clad similarly as their Rohirrim counterparts.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\n\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II\n\nThe Dunlendings are used as units or powers which Isengard and the\nGoblins can use for 10 power points.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings Online\n\nThe Dunlendings appear as both enemies and allies in this game, and,\nlike most Hill-men in the game, are based loosely on Celtic tribes.\n\n\nThe Lord of the Rings Film Trilogy\n\nIn Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, the men of\nDunland are portrayed as a tribe of vile men similar to the real life\nCeltic tribes who accept Saruman's offer to serve him and his master\nSauron the Lord of the Earth. They raid the villages of Rohan along\nbands of orcs and Uruk-hai of Isengard and Mordor. In the extended\nversion of The Two Towers, the Dunlending chieftain is seen making a\nblood oath to Saruman in the wizard's tower of Orthanc."

    "text": "SILVAN ELVES (also known as '''Woodland Elves ''') are a subgroup of\nthe Nandor, and are thus ultimately of Telerin origin. As Úmanyar, they,\nlike the Sindar, began the Great Journey but did not complete it. In the\nThird Age, most remaining Silvan Elves lived either in Lothlórien or the\nWoodland Realm.\n\n\nHistory\n\nOrigin\n\nThe Silvan Elves were of Nandorin background, descended from the\nfollowers of Lenwë, who were fascinated by the landscape East of the\nMisty Mountains and afraid to attempt to cross them. They thus abandoned\nthe Great Journey, choosing instead to remain in those wide forests,\nwhere they became a scattered people.\n\nLittle is known of the wanderings of the Nandor, save that they spread\nthroughout the Vales of Anduin over a period of many centuries, some\nfollowing the Great River southward, eventually settling at the Mouths\nof Anduin or instead turning north again into Eriador, where eventually\nDenethor gathered as many as he could and crossed the Blue Mountains\ninto Beleriand. These were later known as the Green-Elves of Ossiriand,\nand were welcomed by Thingol as long lost kin.\n\nSome of the Nandor however stayed in the forested Vales, and these would\nbecome the Silvan Elves - hidden away in their woodland fastnesses and\nwere to their estranged kin hardly distinguishable from the Avari, and\nindeed sometimes living in friendship with them. Their language had\ndiverged to such an extent that it was barely intelligible to the Sindar\nand Noldor when these met the Silvan Elves again in the Second Age,\nthough the languages were found to be obviously related. It was not\nuntil this renewed contact between the kindreds and the guidance of the\nSindar and Noldor that the Silvan Elves again became an organised people\nand increased in wisdom. This however also led to the Silvan tongue\nbeing largely forgotten, Sindarin instead becoming the primary spoken\nlanguage by the end of the Third Age, with the Silvan dialects only\nsurviving in several names of places and persons. \n\nThe renewed contact was caused by the destruction of Beleriand after the\nWar of Wrath, for when the Second Age was young, the Silvan Elves\nwelcomed those survivors of the calamity who rather than crossing the\nSea rejoined their kindred east of the Misty Mountains. Indeed soon\nmany of the Silvan Elves came to be ruled by these Sindar refugees,\nprimarily in Lothlórien and the Woodland Realm.\n\nThe Woodland Realm\n\nThe primarily Silvan Elves of Mirkwood were known to be distrustful of\nDwarves but friendly to Men, with whom they traded. Mirkwood had been\ncalled Greenwood the Great until around the year TA 1050, when the\nshadow of the Dark Lord Sauron fell upon it, and men began to call it\nMirkwood. During his journey to the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo Baggins had\nto rescue the Dwarves of Thorin II Oakenshield's company from these\nElves. These Elves sent hosts to both the War of the Last Alliance\nand the Battle of the Five Armies.\n\nLegolas of the Fellowship of the Ring, although he lived among them was\nnot truly one of the Silvan folk. As a son of the Elven-king Thranduil,\nwhose father Oropher had originally come from Doriath, Legolas was\nlikely actually at least half of Sindarin heritage on his father's side\n(his mother's identity being unknown).\n\nIt is important to note that while by the end of the Third Age, Sindarin\nhad become the primary language of the Woodland Realm, Silvan being\nalmost completely forgotten, that in the early years of the Sindarin\nrule over the Silvan Elves here, the Sindar for a time “deliberately”\nadopted the language and customs of the Silvan Elves, as “they wished to\nreturn to the simple life natural to the elves before the invitation of\nthe Valar had disturbed it”. \n\nLórien\n\nThe Silvan Elves of Lórien were the larger part of the Galadhrim or the\nTree-people, who were a mixture of elves of Nandor, Noldor, and Sindar\ndescent. Most of the Sindar that came to Lórien were refugees from\nBeleriand, arriving early in the Second Age, and the Sinda Amdír became\nthe King of Lórien. After Amdír was killed in the Battle of Dagorlad,\nhis son Amroth became King.\n\nAfter the destruction of Eregion, they were joined by many Sindarin\nspeaking Noldor, led by Galadriel and Celeborn, who fled to Lórien\nthrough Moria. Galadriel was of Noldor descent, being the daughter of\nFinarfin, while Celeborn was of Sindarin descent of the Kingdom of\nDoriath. When Amroth was lost in the Third Age, Galadriel and Celeborn\nbecame known as the Lady and Lord of Lórien, but neither of them took\nthe vacant Kingship.\n\nAt the time of the War of the Ring they spoke an accent or dialect of\nSindarin which had changed so much that Frodo Baggins, who spoke some\nSindarin, could not understand them. Additionally, few elves of Lórien\ncould speak Westron, so that Haldir, one of the few that could, had to\naccompany them on their way to Caras Galadhon.\n\n\nPortrayal in Adaptations\n\n In the film\nadaptions of _The Hobbit_, Beorn describes the Woodland Elves as being\nless wise and more dangerous than their kin. Most of the Silvan Elves\nare shown to have red hair, and some have brown. The Silvan Elves are\nshown to be highly skilled in combat, and very agile. A notable member,\nwho is created for the films, is the Elf captain Tauriel. In Mirkwood\nthe Silvan Elves are treated as a lower class by Thranduil, as he and\nLegolas are Sindarin Elves, marked out by their white blond hair.\n\nThe Silvan Elves are shown to be great in number when Thranduil unveils\nhis entire army in the Battle of the Five Armies. Their number is\nestimated to be at least 8,000 strong in the film. Thranduil's army\nconsists of spearmen, archers, and swordsmen. When they battled the\nDwarves, the Elven archers wielding longbows fired at the Dwarves, but\nthe arrow volley was destroyed by spinning ballistas. As the Dwarf\ngoat-cavalry was about to charge the Elves, the archers from the front\nretreated back and the Elven spearmen wielding long spears, and quickly\nformed a shield wall. The Dwarf cavalry then jumped to the shield wall\nbut the Elves formed a unique formation, with spearmen from the sides\nand the archers firing at them."

    "text": "The_' Haradrim, KNOWN IN WESTRON AS THE Southrons_' and once as the\n“SWERTINGS” by Hobbits, were a race of Men from Harad in the region of\nMiddle-earth directly south of Gondor. A part of the histories of the\nWestlands is given to the fierce people who in the Second and the Third\nAge of the Sun, came from the hot deserts and forests of sunlands, which\nlay in the South of Middle-earth. These people were ruled by many and\nlords, until in time Sauron the Maia corrupted them and called them to\nwar.\n\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the Second Age the Men of Númenor built a great city in the firth\nof Umbar, a vast natural harbour on the southern shores of the Bay of\nBelfalas, eventually turning the city into a fortified citadel from\nwhose gates the Men of Númenor could levy great tributes upon many of\nthe tribes of Harad.\n\nFor many years, the Haradrim were the greatest enemy of Gondor. Several\ntimes, they invaded the north. Finally, the Men of Gondor were able to\ncapture Harad, though it was later freed. During the War of the Ring the\nHaradrim were allied with Sauron. A Haradrim warrior wounded Faramir. At\nthe Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the 18,000 Haradrim were a great\nthreat to the Rohirrim that had come to aid the people of Minas Tirith.\nDuring the onslaught a Haradrim chieftain, who bore the standard of a\nblack serpent on a scarlet field, led the Haradrim cavalry. King Théoden\nof Rohan slew him in single combat.\n\nOnce Sauron was destroyed, the Haradrim, Variags, and Easterlings\ndisbanded from the Black Gates and out of Mordor, and became dispersed.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _HARADRIM_ means “South-people”, from the Sindarin _harad_\n(“south”) and _rim_ (“host, group”).\n\nOther names were SOUTHERNS, SOUTHRONS.\n\n\nTraits and culture\n\nThe Haradrim were bold and grim men, fierce in despair. They were tall\nand dark-skinned with black hair and dark eyes, and for that they were\ncalled SWERTINGS or SWARTHY MEN. The men of Near Harad were\nbrown-skinned, with black hair and dark eyes, while the race known as\n“half-trolls” out of Far Harad had black skin.\n\nMany Haradrim warriors were seen in bright clothing, such as scarlet\nrobes, and were decorated with golden ornaments, such as collars,\nearrings, corsets of overlapping brazen plates; they braided their hair\nwith gold. Some tribes painted their bodies. Scarlet and red was also\nthe color of their banners, tips of their spears, and body paint. Their\nshields were yellow and black with spikes. It is also mentioned that\nat the end of the Second Age some of the Men in the south had weapons of\niron. At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Haradrim bore\nscimitars that glittered like stars.\n\nThe Haradrim had tamed the massive _Mûmakil_ beasts and used them in\nwarfare and, like their masters, were decorated with scarlet and gold.\nThey even strapped towers on their backs, used by Haradrim archers and\nspearmen.\n\nHarad's tribes included into those of Near and Far Harad, although there\nwere many tribes of the Haradrim, often mutually hostile. Some of the\npeoples of Far Harad were organized into kingdoms.\n\nLanguage\n\nTo the Gondorians their voices sounded harsh, like shouts of beasts.\n\nThe only word which is stated to come from a southron language is\n“Mûmak”, the name of the great war-oliphaunts of Harad.\n\nGandalf states that his name in “the south” is “Incánus” thought\n_Inkā-nūsh_ (or possibly _Inkā-nūs_), meaning “North-spy”.\n\nDespite having a meaning in Quenya (“fate”), the name Umbar is said to\nbe adapted from the natives' language and not from Elvish or Adûnaic.\n\n\nEnvironment\n\n\n\nThe lands of the Haradrim lie to the south of Gondor past the river\nPoros. In the land south of Gondor, the sun beat down unrelentingly,\ncooking much of Haradwaith into desert.\n\n\nMilitary Tactics\n\n\n\nThe Haradrim are said to be skilled horsemen, though not near the\nprowess of the Rohirrim. They are known to have mounted champions and\narchers, as well as infantry. Horses fear the Mumakil, and so the\nSouthron forces often rally around them when faced with mounted foes.\n\n\nFuture of Harad\n\nMuch of Harad's impressive army was wiped out on the expanses of\nPelennor Fields, during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. With Sauron\ndefeated, many Harad peoples sent emissaries to the court of King\nAragorn, and peace talks began; however, many other Haradrim tribes\ncontinued hostility with Gondor.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nPeter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy\n\nIn Peter Jackson's _The Lord of the Rings film trilogy_, the Haradrim\nare inspired by Aztecs and Kiribati tribes, according to the ROTK DVD's\n_Weta Workshop_ documentary. Their bows, possibly of compound design,\nwere made out of composite materials like antlers and wood and used\nbamboo arrows from leather or bamboo quivers. The apparent leader of the\nHaradrim force is killed in the film not by Théoden, but by Éomer.\n\nVideo games\n\n-   They appears as toys in _The Lord of the Rings Trading Card\n    Game_ and _The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II_. \n-   In _The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring_,  they appears as\n    “Haradrim Slayers”.\n-   _The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game_ has given the unnamed\n    Haradrim leader Théoden kills the name Suladân and the title\n    “Serpent Lord”, and its players often refer to him as the “Black\n    Serpent” after his standard. Some are assassins called “hasharin”;\n    there are also characters like “The Golden King” and “Dalamyr”, and\n    place-names such as “Kârna”, “Abrakân”, “Badharkân”, “Hidâr”,\n    “Nâfarat”, and “Dhâran-sar” appear.\n\n\nTrivia\n\n-   In Chinese translation, Southrons is translated as “南蠻”, which is\n    an ancient rival kingdom near China.\n\n\nGallery"

    "text": "The DAGOR BRAGOLLACH or BATTLE OF THE SUDDEN FLAME was the fourth of the\ngreat battles of the War of the Jewels. It marked the end of the Siege\nof Angband and beginning of Morgoth's gains against the Elves and Men of\nthe Beleriand.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\n\n\nFor four hundred years after Dagor Aglareb the Ñoldor had managed to\ncontain Morgoth's power inside Angband. Peace and prosperity reigned in\nBeleriand, to the point where green grass grew even to the very doors of\nAngband. The strength of the Elven kingdoms, and that of their Edain\nallies, became such that Fingolfin, High King of the Ñoldor, believed\nthat the siege would last forever. But though the Elves and Edain had\nmanaged to contain Morgoth's forces, it was beyond their power to\nassault Angband or to overthrow the power of Morgoth. As such, the Dark\nLord labored undisturbed in Angband during the siege, breeding countless\nlegions of Orcs and other evil creatures, as well creating the first\nDragon. He intended to use this new, unprecedentedly powerful force to\nutterly destroy those who had opposed him. However, in the furious haste\nof his malice, he decided to strike before his designs were complete,\ncynically underestimating the valor of the Elves, and not accounting for\nthe Edain at all. This haste was credited as the reason why resistance\nagainst Morgoth was able to continue after the conclusion of the\nconflict; for if Morgoth had waited for a short time longer to complete\nthe buildup of his forces, his foes would have been annihilated.\n\nOn a cold winter's night when the Elven watch was at its least vigilant,\nMorgoth sent out rivers of flame and poisonous fumes from Thangorodrim\nand the Iron Mountains. The plains of Ard-galen were consumed by the\nfire and transformed into a barren desert which was renamed\nAnfauglith, “the Gasping Dust”. The Elves had never faced an assault of\nthis sort before, and many perished as they fled from these flames.\nBehind them came the Balrogs, Glaurung the Father of Dragons, and\nlegions of Orcs in such numbers as the Elves had never imagined.\nMorgoth's primary aim was an onslaught so rapid that the various\nkingdoms of the Elves would not be able to consolidate their forces or\ncome to each others aid. And so it was that each of the Elven kingdoms\nhad to fight Morgoth's forces on their own. The Orcs quickly overran the\nhighlands of Dorthonion, and slew Angrod and Aegnor. Maglor's horsemen\nwere burnt alive on the plain of Lothlann, and Maglor's Gap was taken,\ngiving Morgoth an entry into Beleriand. Maglor retreated with heavy\nlosses to Himring, where he helped defend the city of Maedhros. Though\ngrievously besieged, the heavily fortified city did not fall, and\nMaedhros himself accomplished deeds of surpassing valor during the\nfighting.\n\nThe Pass of Aglon was also breached, and Celegorm and Curufin fled north\nof Doriath to Nargothrond. Morgoth's Orcs took the mountain forests of\nMount Rerir, and defiled Lake Helevorn, scattering south through\nThargelion into East Beleriand. Caranthir fled to Amon Ereb, where he\nand Amrod built defenses. From there they slowly freed East Beleriand of\nthe Orcs, while Maglor and Maedhros held the northern border.\nEventually, Maedhros even managed to re-secure the Pass of Aglon,\ndenying the forces of Morgoth continued entry into Beleriand from that\nroute.\n\n\n\nMinas Tirith in the Pass of Sirion in the West under Orodreth held, and\nOrodreth's uncle and Lord Finrod Felagund came north from Nargothrond\nwith a large army. However, they were ambushed by a huge number of\nMorgoth's forces at the Fen of Serech. The Noldor found themselves\ntrapped, and Finrod would have been killed or taken but for a sortie by\nBarahir and his men, who descended from Dorthonion and rescued the Elven\nlord. The cost in lives was heavy, but Finrod escaped the Orcs. In\nprofound gratitude, Finrod gave Barahir his ring, which would become\nknown as the Ring of Barahir, and pledged that he would aid Barahir and\nhis kin in any time of need.\n\nFinrod and his folk fled south to Nargothrond, while Barahir continued\ndefending Dorthonion until both his forces and his people dwindled to\nnothing. The mountain forts of the Ered Wethrin around Hithlum were\nheavily assaulted but managed barely to hold, as the mountains\nthemselves provided protection from the fires Morgoth had released from\nThangorodrim.\n\nThus the Siege was broken, the Sons of Fëanor scattered, and the forces\nof Morgoth roamed at will throughout the north.\n\nWhen Fingolfin, the High King of the Ñoldor, learned of the heavy\ncasualties of so many Ñoldor, he rode in wrath across the dust of\nAnfauglith to Angband and challenged Morgoth to single combat. At the\ndoors of Angband itself, they fought a great duel, and Fingolfin wounded\nMorgoth seven times. Yet, Fingolfin was ultimately no match for the Dark\nLord and was crushed beneath Morgoth's foot, but not before stabbing\nMorgoth in the heel with his last stroke. Thorondor, king of the Great\nEagles, then swooped down and retrieved Fingolfin's body and scarred\nMorgoth's face. Though Morgoth's wounds would never heal and he was left\nwith a permanent limp, Morgoth and his forces were nevertheless\nvictorious.\n\nStill, Morgoth was cautious. For though he had won a great victory, his\nfoes had inflicted upon him loss as great as their own. As his initial\nonslaught had abated, his foes had begun to recover, making small\nadvances into the fringes of the territory he had conquered. He had not\nexpected the Elves to resist him so strongly, and the aid of their Edain\nallies had been a completely unforeseen variable in his plans. As such,\nhe checked his assault and recalled the main host of the Orcs to\nAngband.\n\nTwo years after Morgoth's onslaught abated, the isle of Tol Sirion, held\nby Orodreth brother of Finrod, came under assault by Morgoth's most\nterrible servant, Sauron. His coming caused a dark cloud of fear to grip\nthe hearts and wills of the defenders, and the watchtower of Minas\nTirith upon the isle was taken. This secured for Morgoth the western\npass of the river Sirion. After another five years had passed, Morgoth\nrenewed his assault against Hithlum and very nearly destroyed it.\nFortunately for Fingon, now High King of the Ñoldor, his forces were\nreinforced by a host under the command of Círdan, and the Orcs were\nrepelled.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_DAGOR BRAGOLLACH_ is Sindarin for 'Battle of Sudden Flame'."

    "text": "DORIATH (Sindarin IPA: ) (aka ARTANOR\") was an Elven realm, the land\nof the Sindar that existed during the latter-half of the Years of the\nTrees and most of the First Age of the Sun. For thousands of years it\nwas separate from the outside world under the rule of King Thingol and\nthe protection of his wife Melian the Maia, until it was drawn into the\nwar against Morgoth and the doom that lay on the Ñoldor, because of the\nOath of Fëanor.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nDoriath was located in the middle of Beleriand, between Ered Gorgoroth\n(Mountains of Terror) from the north and the Andram from south, and\nTalath Dirnen from the west, and Estolad from the east. It was a realm\nof forests about the great river Sirion; within it were the forests\n_Neldoreth_ (also _Taur-na-Neldor_, the northern beech forest), _Nivrim_\n(also West-march, an oak forest), and _Region_ (pronounced Reh-gi-on,\nthe main forest). Additionally, the forests of _Brethil_ and ''Nan\nElmoth ''were considered to be under the influence of Thingol, though\nnot under his direct command and laying outside of the Girdle of Melian.\nEöl the Dark Elf leased Nan Elmoth from Thingol, having paid with the\nsword Anglachel. The People of Haleth, or the Haladin, lived in Brethil\nwith the permission of Thingol. They governed themselves, but cooperated\nwith the march-wardens of Doriath. King Elu Thingol of Doriath, also\nHigh King of the Sindar, saw all of Beleriand as his realm, from the\nGelion to the Belegaer (the Sea).\n\n\nHistory\n\nYears of the Trees\n\nThe Vanyar and Ñoldor had passed by it on the Great Journey, and had\nbeen ferried across on Tol Eressëa by the time the Teleri arrived. Then\ntheir lord Elwë was lost in Nan Elmoth, and when Ulmo returned for them,\na part remained behind. They became known as the Sindar or Grey Elves,\nand when Thingol returned he became their king, ruling from Doriath.\n\nThe forests of Neldoreth and Region were located in the center of\nBeleriand, and were the abode of King Thingol and Melian. Their people\nwere the people of the Teleri who did not heed the call of the Valar to\npass over the sea to Valinor. All the Elves of Beleriand, from the\nshipbuilders under Círdan in the Falas, to the hunters of the Blue\nMountains, held Thingol as their lord. During the First and Second Ages\nof the Chaining of Melkor, Beleriand was peaceful. However, by the end\nof the First Age, Melian forebode that evil was to come, and Thingol\ncalled on the aid of the Dwarves of Belegost to aid in constructing a\ncity-fortress for the protection of his people. They also helped make\nfor them a store of stronger and better weapons that were better able to\ndeal with the Orcs of north. This was built under ground along the\nsouthern side of the River Esgalduin, and was called Menegroth, which\nbecame Thingol's capital.\n\nFor the most part, the Elves lived in scattered bands throughout\nBeleriand, only gathering in larger numbers in Neldoreth and Region\n(together called Eglador), and along the Falas. During the Third Age of\nthe Chaining of Melkor, Thingol proceeded to arm his people with the aid\nof the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost against the continued foreboding\nof Melian.\n\nAfter Melkor's release, his attack on the Two Trees with Ungoliant, and\nflight to Middle-earth, the situation for Beleriand suddenly worsened.\nUngoliant fled south from the Balrogs after her confrontation with\nMelkor, now Morgoth, and was only checked by the power of Melian. Some\ntime after, the forces of Morgoth left the freshly delved Angband and\nassaulted Beleriand from east and west in the First Battle of Beleriand.\nIn the east, King Thingol lead the forces of Beleriand, with the aid of\nDenethor and his Nandor and elves from Ossiriand, and completely\ndefeated the Orcs of the eastern army. Denethor was killed on Amon Ereb,\nand some of his people merged themselves to the Sindarin Elves under\nKing Thingol. Upon returning to Menegroth, Thingol learned that the\nwestern army of Morgoth had overrun the Falas. Thingol recalls all of\nhis people he can into Neldoreth and Region, and Melian puts forth her\npower and rings the region in a girdle of enchantment called the Girdle\nof Melian. At that point, the region formally called Eglador comes to be\nformally known as Doriath, the Guarded Kingdom.\n\nThe First Battle is the only time King Thingol leads his forces into\nbattle outside of his realm for the entirety of the First Age of the\nSun. Afterwards, the Elves of Doriath fight defensively, guarding their\nborders and the important river crossings nearby.\n\nFirst Age\n\n\n\nWhen the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth at the beginning of the First\nAge, Thingol refused to allow them in Doriath, with the exception of the\nchildren of Finarfin, who were related to him by his brother Olwë.\n\nWhen later Men arrived in Beleriand, they were also refused entry, but\nat Finrod's request the Haladin gives his permission for the People of\nHaleth to dwell in Brethil, who ally themselves with Doriath and aid\nthem in its defense.\n\nThroughout the rest of the First Age, while the Noldor fight their wars\nwith Morgoth, Doriath stands inviolate and generally aloof, refusing to\ntake part in the wars. Ultimately, however, King Thingol is pulled into\nthe doom surround the Noldor as was told in the Lay of Leithian, when\nBeren, son of Barahir and lord of the First House of Men, passed through\nthe Girdle as Melian had foretold, and arrived in Neldoreth.\n\nRealizing that his beloved daughter Lúthien had fallen in love with him,\nKing Thingol decreed that he would not allow them to marry unless Beren\nwould undertake a quest to recover a Silmaril from the Dark Lord\nMorgoth, and so begins the Quest for the Silmarils. After the Quest for\nthe Silmaril, the Wolf Carcharoth also breached the Girdle, but Thingol,\nBeren, and Thingol's captains Beleg and Mablung hunted and killed the\nbeast.\n\nAt the end of this, Thingol ended up in possession of one of the\nSilmarils. Beren and Lúthien, wedded together by fate and returning from\nthe dead, left Doriath to live in Ossiriand. After the Nirnaeth\nArnoediad, only three elven kingdoms remained: Nargothrond, Gondolin,\nand Doriath. Nargothrond fell soon after, as told in the _Narn i Chîn\nHúrin_ (Tale of the Children of Hurin).\n\nFearing that the cruel Easterlings would enthrall her only\nson Túrin of Hithlum, Morwen sent him to Doriath where he would be safe\nuntil he came of age, when he fled from the land. Later his mother and\nsister, Morwen and Nienor lived there, until they were lost.\n\nHurin, captured at the Nirnaeth and released from Angband after the\ndeath of his son Turin, recovers the Nauglamir from the ruin of\nNargothrond. Traveling to Doriath, he throws it at the feet of Thingol\nin spite. Melian rebukes him, and Hurin, cured of the madness of Morgoth\nby Melian, lifts up the Nauglamir and presents it to Thingol before\nleaving Doriath, and vanishing from history.\n\nFall of Doriath\n\nHúrin brought the treasure of Nargothrond to Doriath after the fall of\nFinrod's realm, and Thingol enlisted the Dwarves of Nogrod to combine\nthe Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien with the Nauglamir, the Dwarves'\nNecklace. The Dwarves then attacked Thingol and slew him, stealing the\nnecklace, during the first Sack of Doriath. Melian then left, and with\nher, the protective Girdle thus ended the bliss of old that reigned in\nDoriath for thousands of years, and things would never be the same\nagain.\n\nThingol, in possession of the greatest work of the Elves (a Silmaril of\nFëanor) and Dwarves (the Nauglamir) decides to merge the two. He\nconvinces a large company of smiths from Nogrod to attempt to remake the\nNauglamir to incorporate the Silmaril, which they succeed in doing. Once\nthe work is complete, and the joint works of Elves and Dwarves sits\nglittering before Thingol, he moves to take it and put it on. The\nDwarves stop him, demanding it in payment. Thingol rebukes them with\nhaughty words, at which the Dwarves slay him. The Dwarves attempt to\nescape Doriath, but most are killed and the Nauglamir recovered. After\nThingol's death, Melian departs Doriath in grief and withdraws her power\nfrom Doriath. After telling Mablung to send word to Beren, she vanishes\nfrom Middle-earth and returns to Valinor. Doriath now lies\nundefended.\n\nTwo Dwarves return from Doriath and tell a twisted version of the events\nto their king in Nogrod. The Dwarves of Nogrod raise an army and assault\nDoriath in retaliation. The slaughter is great on both sides, but the\nDwarves end up victorious. Menegroth is ransacked, many of its people\nare killed, and the Dwarves begin the long trek for home laden with the\nspoils of war, including the Nauglamir. At Sarn Athrad, they are\nassaulted by a force of Green Elves led by Beren who, with the aid of\nthe Ents of Ossiriand, annihilate the Dwarven force and recover the\nSilmaril.\n\nDior Eluchîl, son of Beren and Lúthien and heir to Thingol, returns to\nDoriath with his wife Nimloth, their two sons Eluréd and Elurín, and\ntheir daughter Elwing. He begins to rebuild the fortunes of the kingdom\nand it is briefly restored. Beren takes the Nauglamir to Lúthien, who\nwears it, enriching their home on Tol Galen. However, Beren and Lúthien\nsoon die for the second time, leaving the world forever. The Nauglamir\nand its Silmaril are brought to Dior.\n\nSoon after, the Sons of Fëanor, following the Oath, demand the return of\nthe Silmaril. Dior refuses, and the Sons of Fëanor invade Doriath, at\nwhich point the Second Kinslaying occurs. Celegorm, Curufin, and\nCaranthir are killed, as is Dior, Nimloth, and Eluréd and Elurín. The\npeople of Doriath are killed or scattered, with Elwing taking the\nNauglamir and fleeing with a remnant of the people of Doriath to the\nMouths of Sirion.\n\nDoriath was never rebuilt and afterwards Doriath remained abandoned and\nunpopulated until it was sunk along with most of the rest of\nBeleriand.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nIn Sindarin, _Doriath_ means “Land of the Fence”, from _dôr_ (“land”)\nand _iâth_ (“fence”). Its previous name _EGLADOR_ either means “Land of\nthe Forsaken” or “Land of the Elves”, because the inhabitants called\nthemselves “Eglath”. The High Elves called Doriath the “Land of the\nCave”, from the Ñoldorin _gath_ or _gatta_ (“cavern”)\n\n_GARTHÚRIAN_ was name ascribed to the land of Doriath in earlier\nversions of the accounts of the First Age (specifically in _The War of\nthe Jewels_)_._"

    "text": "QUENTA SILMARILLION is a collection of fictional legends written by J.\nR. R. Tolkien. It was published after his death as part of _The\nSilmarillion_ together with four shorter stories. As Tolkien did not\nfinish it, the collection was completed by his son Christopher with\nassistance of the young Guy Gavriel Kay. The title _Quenta Silmarillion_\nis translated as “the Tale of the Silmarils”. The QUENTA SILMARILLION is\nthe third part of the _The Silmarillion._\n\n_Quenta Silmarillion_ is the largest final-rendition account of the\nFirst Age, and its stories narrate all of that Age's major events.\n\n\nContents\n\n-   Of the Beginning of Days\n-   Of Aulë and Yavanna\n-   Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\n-   Of Thingol and Melian\n-   Of Eldamar and the Princes of the Eldalië\n-   Of Fëanor and the Unchaining of Melkor\n-   Of the Silmarils and the Unrest of the Noldor\n-   Of the Darkening of Valinor\n-   Of the Flight of the Noldor\n-   Of the Sindar\n-   Of the Sun and Moon and the Hiding of Valinor\n-   Of Men\n-   Of the Return of the Noldor\n-   Of Beleriand and its Realms\n-   Of the Noldor in Beleriand\n-   Of Maeglin\n-   Of the Coming of Men into the West\n-   Of the Ruin of Beleriand and the Fall of Fingolfin\n-   Of Beren and Lúthien\n-   Of the Fifth Battle: Nirnaeth Arnoediad\n-   Of Túrin Turambar\n-   Of the Ruin of Doriath\n-   Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin\n-   Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nTolkien envisaged _The Silmarillion_ as deriving from a manuscript\nwritten by an Eriol or Ælfwine of England; an imaginary Dark Age source\nfor the material, which itself contains little or no reference to the\npeople or events of the Second or Third Ages of his legendarium.\nOriginated from Elvish legends, in some parts it presents Elves as long\ngone, which hints that its final form was edited during the Fourth Age\nby Hobbits and/or Men.\n\nIt tells about the history of Arda (the Earth), after its creation by\nEru Ilúvatar. The Valar, angelic beings, enter into the world and try to\nshape it after a vision given to them by Eru. The initial shape of Arda,\nchosen by the Valar, was of a symmetrical continent lit by the Two\nLamps. However, the lamps were destroyed by the vicious Melkor; Arda was\ndarkened, and the lamps' fall spoiled the symmetry of Arda's surface.\nTwo main continents were created that are of concern to the story: Aman\nin the west, and Middle-earth in the east.\n\nFollowing this, Melkor hid himself from the Valar in his fortress Utumno\nin the north of Middle-earth. He also surrounded himself with horrible\nbeasts, many of them Maia in the form of fell animals, known as Balrogs.\n\nThe Valar moved to the western continent Aman where they established the\nrealm Valinor of which Manwë was made king. The Vala Yavanna created the\nTwo Trees which illuminated Valinor. Middle-earth, by contrast, was in\nperpetual darkness, and was seldom visited by the Valar. Only some of\nthem, most notably Oromë, visited it periodically, especially to prepare\nfor the coming of the Elves, which the Valar had foreseen in their\nvision and to keep an eye on Melkor's activities.\n\nIntroduction of the Elves\n\nOn one of his expeditions Oromë discovered the newly-awakened Elves at\nCuiviénen. The Valar, aware of the risk Melkor posed to the Elves,\nbeleaguered his fortress and finally overthrew him and took him prisoner\nto Valinor to serve “three ages” in the Halls of Mandos.\n\nOromë was then sent to the Elves again, to invite them to come with him\nto Aman and live there. Some of the Elves did not follow him or became\nsidetracked and stayed in Middle-earth, and so the Elves became\nsundered. These notably included the Sindar, who stayed in Middle-earth\nwhen their king, Thingol, became lost in the forest. He was to later\nemerge, married to the Maia Melian, and found the Kingdom of Doriath.\n\nThe Elves who accepted the summons were carried across the sea on a\nfloating island.\n\nThe Noldor and Melkor\n\nFinwë, the first High King of the Ñoldor, had a son Fëanor. At his birth\nFëanor drew so much life from his mother Míriel that she grew weary of\nlife and her spirit left her bodily form, departing to the halls of\nMandos. Eventually, Finwë married Indis and had two further sons,\nFingolfin and Finarfin. Fëanor became the most famous Elven craftsman,\nespecially by making the Silmarils, three jewels in which he trapped the\nlight of the Two Trees. The Silmarils were hallowed by Varda, and would\nburn any evil or mortal creature who touched them.\n\nAbout this time, Melkor, having completed his sentence, convinced the\nother Valar that he had reformed and he was released. By various lies he\nmanaged to play Fëanor and Fingolfin against each other, creating strife\nand division amongst the Noldor; furthermore, he convinced the Ñoldor\nthat they had been brought to Aman primarily so the Valar could keep\nthem under control. Finally, Fëanor rebelled against the Valar, publicly\nadvocating leaving and then drawing his weapon against Fingolfin.\n\nThe Valar were soon aware of Melkor's ultimate responsibility in this.\nTulkas hunted him, but Melkor had hidden and could not be found. Because\nhe threatened Fingolfin's life, Fëanor was exiled from Tirion for twelve\nyears. With his seven sons and his father Finwë he moved to a\nnewly-built stronghold, Formenos.\n\nCoveting the Silmarils, Melkor went to Formenos, hoping to trick Fëanor\nand gain possession of them, but Fëanor saw through his ruse and\ndismissed him with contempt. Melkor then traveled to Avathar in secret,\nwhere he joined forces with the evil spirit Ungoliant, whose form was a\ngiant spider-like creature. Melkor swore an oath to give Ungoliant\nwhatever she desired, and imparted some of his power to her. With her\nhelp, they traveled into Valinor secretly, where Ungoliant's poison\nkilled the Two Trees. Covered by an impenetrable blackness, Melkor and\nUngoliant then traveled to Formenos, assassinated Finwë and stole the\nSilmarils, before escaping in the confusion.\n\nMelkor and Ungoliant then made their way across to Middle-earth, and he\ngave Ungoliant all the great jewels he had stolen, except the Silmarils,\nwhich he desired to keep. The rapacious Ungoliant consumed them all and,\nstill hungry, she demanded the Silmarils, but the ever-treacherous\nMelkor reneged on his oath, so she seized him and bound him with her\nwebs, and his anguished cries echoed across all of Middle-earth.\n\nMelkor escaped from Ungoliant with the help of his former servants, the\nBalrogs, who came to his aid from their hiding places in the deepest\nrecesses of the ruins of Utumno, and he re-established his empire in the\nNorth from his secondary fortress of Angband. He placed the three\nSilmarils, which now were the only source of the unmarred light of the\nTwo Trees, in his Iron Crown, although his hands were burned black by\nthem.\n\nFëanor was furious at the death of his father and the theft of the\nSilmarils. Travelling to Tirion in violation of his exile, he publicly\nblamed both Melkor, whom he named Morgoth, and the Valar (for failing to\nprotect Finwë and the Silmarils). He urged the Noldor to leave Valinor,\nfor a punitive expedition against Morgoth and a new life in\nMiddle-earth. He and his sons then swore the notorious Oath of Fëanor,\nvowing to pursue with hatred anyone who withheld a Silmaril from them.\n\nDeparture of the Noldor and assault on Doriath\n\nInflamed by the passionate urging of Fëanor, most of the assembled\nÑoldor left Tirion, and traveled to Alqualondë, attempting to persuade\nthe Teleri to join them, or at least to lend them ships to cross the\nGreat Sea. When the Teleri refused, Fëanor ordered that the swan-ships\nbe taken by force; the notorious Kinslaying ensued, in which many Teleri\nwere slaughtered. Shortly afterwards, at the northern boundary of\nEldamar, the Noldor encountered Mandos, who cursed all the Ñoldor who\nleft with Fëanor .\n\nAt this point, Finarfin, who had always been reluctant to leave, turned\nback to Valinor with a small number of followers. Many ships had been\nlost by this time and not all the Ñoldor could cross to Middle-earth, so\nFëanor and his sons seized the remaining swan-ships, abandoning\nFingolfin and his followers (including Galadriel), who were obliged to\nmake their way to Middle-earth across the terrible ice wastes of the\nHelcaraxë. Approximately 2.2 million Noldor are said to have perished on\nthe Helcaraxë.\n\nMeanwhile, Morgoth attempted to conquer Doriath, the realm of Thingol\nand Melian in Middle-earth. In the first of five great Battles, he sent\nout two armies of Orcs, forcing Thingol and his Maia queen to establish\na magical boundary around Doriath, the “Girdle of Melian”, while the\ncoastal Elves were forced to retreat into their fortified harbour towns.\nBy luck, Fëanor and his host arrived at the height of this conflict and\nthe combined forces of the Ñoldor and the Sindar utterly defeated the\nOrc armies in the second Battle, Dagor-nuin-Giliath (Battle under the\nStars). However Fëanor, in his fury, chased after the retreating Orcs\nand he was ambushed and killed by Balrogs.\n\nThe Sun and the Moon, the Long Peace and the Coming of Men\n\nThe grieving Valar could not revive the Two Trees,because Fëanor would\nnot give up the silmarills which captured the light of the trees. But\nthey were able to create the Moon and the Sun from a silver leaf and a\ngolden fruit, which were all that remained of them. These new lights\nilluminated Middle-earth, stimulated much new plant and animal growth,\nand for a while, confounded the plans of Morgoth. Unable to assail them,\nas his once near-limitless power grew ever more dispersed among his\nservants, who feared the new lights no less than he, the Dark Lord was\nforced to take refuge in clouds and shadow that surrounded his\nstrongholds. In this era, Men, the younger Children of Ilúvatar, awoke\nin eastern Middle-earth, and some began to migrate westward.\n\nThe Ñoldor established kingdoms and principalities in northern and\ncentral Beleriand, which were ruled by the descendants of Fëanor,\nFingolfin and Finarfin. They built many great strongholds, including the\nvast cavern-city of Nargothrond, on the river Narog, and the mighty\nhidden mountain fortress of Gondolin, ruled by Turgon, from whence none\nwho entered were permitted to leave. Many of the Sindar, the native\nElves of Beleriand, were absorbed into the Ñoldorin kingdoms. Others\nwere in Sindarin states: Thingol's kingdom in Doriath, the coastal Falas\nruled by Círdan the shipwright, and the secretive Green-Elves of\nOssiriand.\n\nRelations between the Ñoldor and the independent Sindar were at first\namicable but they later deteriorated. The Ñoldor had long hidden the\ntruth about the Kinslaying and the Curse from Thingol, but he eventually\nlearned of it from Angrod. As a result he banned all the Ñoldor (except\nhis kin in the house of Finarfin) from entering Doriath, decreeing also\nthat the Noldorin tongue could no longer be spoken within his realm.\n\nA further rift between the Ñoldor and the Sindar, which was to have\nfar-reaching consequences, was caused by the actions of Aredhel,\ndaughter of Fingolfin and sister of Turgon. Tiring of her long\nconfinement in Gondolin, she rode east to seek out her old friends, the\nsons of Fëanor, but she was barred from crossing through Doriath by the\ndecree of Thingol. Forced to skirt along the edge of the dreaded region\nof Nan Dungortheb (where Ungoliant had gone after the escape of\nMorgoth), Aredhel was separated from her escort and lost. She was\neventually found by Eöl, the Dark Elf, a kinsman of Thingol who lived\nalone in the dark forest of Nan Elmoth. He took her as his wife, and\nthey had a son, Maeglin. Eöl often traveled east to deal with the\nDwarves of the Blue Mountains, and he acquired great skill in metalwork\nfrom them, which he imparted to his son. He refused to let his wife and\nchild leave his domain, but Aredhel determined to return to Gondolin\nwith her son, so they waited until Eöl left for the east and then made\ntheir escape.\n\nEöl pursued them to Gondolin, where he was captured and brought before\nTurgon. Eöl demanded that Maeglin should leave with him, or be cursed,\nbut Maeglin renounced his father. Turgon then decreed that Eöl must\neither remain in Gondolin or die. The next day, when he was again\nbrought before Turgon, Eöl tried to kill Maeglin with a poisoned lance,\nbut Aredhel stepped between them; struck in the shoulder, she died that\nnight. As punishment, Turgon had Eöl thrown to his death from the walls\nof the fortress. Maeglin remained in Gondolin, became a mighty warrior\nand wrought many great weapons, but his forbidden love for his cousin\nIdril Celebrindal would eventually cause him to betray Gondolin to\nMorgoth.\n\nAfter fifty years, and believing the Noldor to be unprepared for war,\nMorgoth again attacked the from the north, but Fingolfin and Maedhros\nwere ready for him and they defeated Morgoth's forces in the third\nBattle, called Dagor Aglareb, pursuing the Orcs to the very gates of\nAngband and destroying them utterly. They then laid the Siege of\nAngband, which lasted for four hundred years.\n\nAlmost one hundred years after the Dagor Aglareb, Morgoth's forces tried\nto attack the realm of Hithlum by stealing in from the far north-west,\nbut were intercepted and defeated by Fingon. After a further hundred\nyears, Morgoth sent forth the dragon Glaurung, the first of the\nFire-drakes. Being only half-grown and not fully armoured, Glaurung was\nunable to withstand Fingon and his archers, eventually fleeing back to\nAngband. The period after the first defeat of Glaurung became known as\nThe Long Peace, lasting almost two hundred years.\n\nIt was during this time, about three hundred years after the Noldor had\narrived in Beleriand, that Men first came into Middle-earth from the\nregions far to the east. They first appeared in Ossiriand, where\nFelagund was the first of the Noldor to see them. Over the next hundred\nyears many of them became allies of the Noldor in the war against\nMorgoth, and settled in Noldorin realms.\n\nThe Dagor Bragollach\n\nMorgoth, however, merely used the Siege as an opportunity to build up\nstrength, and in , renewed the war on his own terms. The fourth Great\nBattle, Dagor Bragollach became famous for the re-emergence of the\nDragon Glaurung in his full strength. Morgoth's armies overthrew the\nSiege, slaying many of the Noldor, with Glaurung laying waste to\nArd-galen and Dorthonion.\n\nEnraged by the assaults against his people, Fingolfin fearlessly made\nhis way alone to the gates of Angband, where he challenged Morgoth to\nsingle combat and the evil Vala was forced to come out and meet him\nrather than appear cowardly. In the ensuing battle Fingolfin wounded\nMorgoth seven times, but eventually stumbled and fell among the great\npits created by Morgoth's hammer, Grond. Morgoth beat Fingolfin to the\nground three times with his great shield, and then crushed Fingolfin\nunder his foot, but with his dying strength Fingolfin slashed Morgoth's\nfoot, maiming him.\n\nMorgoth broke Fingolfin's body and was about to throw the remains to his\nwolves, but Thorondor, the gigantic king of the eagles, had been\nwatching the battle from afar and at that moment flew down to rescue the\nbody. The giant eagle gouged Morgoth's face with his talons, seized\nFingolfin's body and carried it back to Gondolin for burial. After that\ntime Morgoth's seven wounds never healed, he became lame in his left\nfoot, where Fingolfin had hewn it, and his face forever bore the scars\nof Thorondor's talons.\n\nSixteen years later, Maedhros led the northern Ñoldor and their allies\namong Men in a final desperate attempt to defeat Morgoth. In this\nclimactic battle — which is named Nirnaeth Arnoediad— the forces of the\nÑoldor attacked Angband and briefly broke through the gates, only to be\nbeaten back when Morgoth unleashed his full forces, now vastly\noutnumbering those of Elves and Men. Led by the terrible dragon\nGlaurung, Morgoth's forces crushed the armies of the Ñoldor, and many of\nthe elf lords were killed or captured, leaving Morgoth master of the\nentire North. Afterwards, he set about destroying the remaining\nElf-kingdoms one by one.\n\nThe Dagor Bragollach was the battle in which Gil-galad left Hithlum for\nthe Havens of the Falas.\n\nBeren and Lúthien\n\nThe later parts of the _Quenta Silmarillion_ include two stories dealing\nwith individuals and with the relations between Men and Elves.\n\nThe tragic yet heroic story of Beren and Lúthien (which has similarities\nto the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice) tells of the love between the Man\nBeren and Lúthien, daughter of Thingol and Melian and the most beautiful\nof all Elf Maidens. Thingol, disliking mortal Men and determined to\nprevent their marriage, declares that he will consent only if Beren\nbrings Thingol a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown. Thus, in sending Beren\non this perilous quest, Thingol unwittingly binds himself to the Doom of\nMandos, ensuring his eventual downfall.\n\nTravelling to the mountains of Thangorodrim in disguise, Beren and\nLúthien succeed in making their way into Angband and to the very foot of\nMorgoth's throne. There Lúthien reveals herself, but her beauty and\ncharm enable her to briefly overcome the evil lord and she casts a spell\nthat puts Morgoth and his minions to sleep. Beren then cuts one of the\nSilmarils from Morgoth's iron crown, but when he attempts to take a\nsecond Silmaril his knife snaps and a shard flies off; it cuts Morgoth's\nface, and he begins to stir.\n\nAs they leave, Morgoth and his creatures reawaken and Beren and Lúthien\nare confronted by Carcharoth, the giant Wolf that guards the gate of\nAngband. Beren attempts to hold off the terrible creature with the power\nof the Silmaril, but Carcharoth bites off his hand and swallows the holy\njewel. Driven mad by the pain it inflicts, the creature goes on a\nrampage through Doriath until it is eventually killed by the mighty\nElf-hound Huan. In this final battle Beren is fatally wounded by\nCarcharoth, so Lúthien travels in spirit to the Houses of the Dead, to\nplead with Mandos for Beren's release. She and Beren are sent back to\nMiddle-earth alive, but Lúthien becomes a mortal woman, so that in time\nthey will both die and leave the Universe together. As immortals whose\nsouls are bound to Arda for as long as it lasts, Thingol and Melian\nsuffer the grief of being deprived of their daughter for all time.\n\nTúrin Turambar\n\n_Main article: Túrin Turambar_\n\n_See also: The Children of Húrin_\n\nAlso included is the story of Túrin Turambar. His father Húrin is\ncaptured at the end of the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, and for his\ndefiance, Morgoth places a curse on his family. Túrin becomes a great\nhero, but due partly to his hot temper and partly to a string of bad\nluck (in fact, the working of Morgoth's demonic will), whatever he turns\nhis hand to seems to go wrong, and death and grief haunt those around\nhim. Making matters worse, both Túrin and his sister Niënor are\nenchanted by the mighty dragon Glaurung — who has sacked the great\nElf-city of Nargothrond and taken up residence there — and they fall in\nlove and live for time as man and wife. Eventually Túrin kills Glaurung,\nbut with his death the spell is lifted. Driven mad by the realisation of\ntheir sins, Túrin and Nienor both commit suicide.\n\nGondolin\n\nThe last Elf-Kingdom to fall was the hidden city of Gondolin. Tuor, a\nmortal man, was sent by Ulmo as a messenger to Gondolin, to warn King\nTurgon of the city's impending destruction. Remaining in Gondolin, Tuor\nmarried Turgon's daughter, Idril, and they had a son Eärendil. Gondolin\nwas eventually betrayed to Morgoth by Maeglin, and destroyed. Turgon\nfell during the battle and the High Kingship passed to Gil-galad, who\ndwelt at the Mouth of Sirion. Tuor, Idril and Eärendil escaped, together\nwith a number of refugees.\n\nGrowing up, Eärendil married Elwing, granddaughter of Beren and Lúthien\nand current keeper of the Silmaril they took from Morgoth. With the help\nof the Silmaril, Eärendil and Elwing sailed to Valinor to plead with the\nValar, asking them to pardon the Noldor and assist Elves and Men in\ntheir need. The Valar agreed to this request, and set Eärendil, with the\nSilmaril, to sail the skies as a star until the ending of the world.\n\nBattle between Morgoth and the Host of the Valar\n\nThe Host of the Valar, led by Eönwë, finally attacked Morgoth in\nAngband. In this battle, the Great Battle (also known as the War of\nWrath), Morgoth was utterly defeated; his armies were destroyed, with\nonly a few remnants scattered across the Earth. He was taken prisoner\nand his two remaining Silmarils were confiscated. Maedhros and Maglor,\nFëanor's two surviving sons, stole the Silmarils from Eönwë, but they\nfound the Silmarils would not tolerate their touch, instead tormenting\nthem with burning pain. Maedhros committed suicide by jumping with the\nSilmaril into a chasm in the earth, and Maglor threw his Silmaril away\ninto the sea.\n\nThe Valar pardoned the Ñoldor for their rebellion, and the Teleri\noffered forgiveness for the Kinslaying. Many of the Ñoldor and the\nSindar left Middle-earth and traveled into the West, to live in Valinor.\nMany more followed Gil-galad and stayed in Middle-earth. Morgoth was\ncast out of the World, imprisoned in the Void that lies behind the Walls\nof Night. The Silmarils were lost “unless the World be broken and\nre-made”, but each one found its home in one of the elements: sky,\nwater, and earth."

    "title": "Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age",
    "page_id": "2361",
    "text": "OF THE RINGS OF POWER AND THE THIRD AGE is the fifth and last part of\n_The Silmarillion_ by J. R. R. Tolkien. It is relatively short,\nconsisting of about 20 pages.\n\nThe work is an essay dealing with the preamble to the events described\nin Tolkien's novel _The Lord of the Rings_, and the events themselves,\nin the style of _The Silmarillion_. The fact that those events are\nexplored in a mere handful of pages suggests that if the events\ndescribed in the rest of _The Silmarillion_ had been written in the\nstyle of _The Lord of the Rings_ they would have filled hundreds of\nvolumes. When Tolkien died in 1973, his son, Christopher Tolkien,\ncompleted this part, assisted by Guy Gavriel Kay. _Of the Rings of Power\nand the Third Age_ bears some similarities to Elrond's narrative in _The\nFellowship of the Ring_ during the chapter _The Council of Elrond_;\nneither divulges any details about how Arnor was destroyed and how\nGondor became kingless. The parallel is perhaps intentional; as Elrond\ntold the Second and Third Age through his eyes, the Silmarillion is\nsupposed to be told through the point of the view of the Eldar.\n\n\nSummary\n\nAs the name implies, the events of the essay are focused around magical\nartifacts: the Rings of Power.\n\nThe Elves of Eregion helped Sauron forge many rings, including nineteen\nRings of Power. But Sauron had deceived them, for in secret he made the\nOne Ring for himself, which was the master of the rest. These rings of\npower were distributed to the leaders of the free peoples of Middle\nEarth in order to achieve control and therefore power. Seven to the\nDwarf Lords, nine to mortal Men and three left to the Elves.  But Sauron's plan failed: the Elves discovered his\nplot, for as soon as The Dark Lord put his ring on the Elves knew they\nhad been deceived. They removed and hid the three Elven rings and were\ntherefore shielded from it's and his influence, which would have held\ndominion over all had they kept them. Sauron then waged war upon the\nElves in retaliation but, the three Elvish rings remained hidden from\nhim. While many Elves were killed and the kingdom in Eregion destroyed,\nthe Men of Númenor helped the elves and repelled Sauron. After many\ndecades of war, the Men of Númenor decided to capture Sauron and\ndemonstrate their might. As it is described in Akallabêth, Sauron was\nbrought to Númenor as a slave; however, he soon corrupted most\nNúmenóreans, encouraging them to replace their traditional reverence for\nEru Ilúvatar with worship of Melkor, or Morgoth, Sauron's previous\nmaster. Under Sauron's influence, the Númenórians decided to challenge\nthe Valar by invading Aman. As a result, Númenor was destroyed and sank\nbeneath the waves, a cataclysm far beyond the premeditated schemes of\nSauron who himself was cast down beneath the waves.\n\nOnly a few survivors left Númenor before it was too late, and led by\nElendil the Tall and his two sons Isildur and Anárion, their ships\nreached Middle-earth's coast, and they were recognized and accepted as\nrulers by those who encountered their arrival. They unified\nalready-goverened realms of Men in Númenórean style: Elendil ruled over\nArnor in the North, and Isildur and Anarion ruled together the great\ncountry of Gondor in the South. However, Sauron's spirit survived the\ndisaster too, and although he had lost his fair physical appearance, he\nreturned safely to his stronghold of old in the land of Mordor and\nregained his strength.\n\nYears passed, and Sauron, who had renewed his might, gathered his allies\nof Orcs and evil men, including the Black Númenóreans (most of whom now\nfollowed leaders who wore Rings Of Power) and decided to attack the new\nrealms while they were still weak. His onslaught failed, however and\nKing Elendil, his sons, and the Elven kings forces fought back. For many\nyears the great coalition (The Last Alliance of Elves and Men, as it\nbecame known) besieged Mordor. At last the host broke through to\nSauron's fortress Barad-dûr. Sauron himself came forth to challenge the\nKings of Middle Earth who stood with their Elvish friends. The mighty\nhigh king of the Elves, Gil-galad challenged Sauron to a duel, and lost.\nThen Elendil fought with him and fell as he struck down The Dark Lord;\nIn doing so Isildur's body fell upon his own sword and it shattered\nbeneath his body. Isildur, Elendil's son quickly approached Sauron's\nbody and cut the ring finger off Saurons hand the One Ring and all using\nthe hilt shard of his fathers sword, the final death blow as it would\nseem. Sauron's spirit departed his dark armored body. Lord Elrond Half\nElven who stood nigh tried to convince Isildur to destroy the ring then\nand there in the fires of Mount Doom where it was made, and the only\nplace it could be destroyed for ever: But he took it for his own and\ndeclared that it would be a weregild for his Father, and Brother\nAnárion, who also was killed during the siege of Barad-dûr). The Elves\ncould now wear their three Rings Of Power freely as The One was no\nlonger worn by the defeated Dark Lord. Thus began the Third Age of\nMiddle-earth.\n\nIn the first months of the Third Age Isildur and his guard were ambushed\nby a band of orcs nigh to The Gladden Fields. With almost all of his men\nkilled Isildur put the Ring on his finger in the hope of alluding the\nfoul Orcs as the Ring made him invisible. He plunged into Anduin the\ngreat river in order to escape. Yet the Ring betrayed him. It slipped\nfrom his finger revealing him to the Orcs who shot him with many arrows.\nAs Isildur died the Ring was lost in the great river for many centuries.\n\n\n\nThe Heirs of the remaining royal blood-line were chosen to lead Arnor\nand Gondor. For a millennium, both realms enjoyed relative freedom and\nprosperity. However afterwards, Arnor became subject to attacks from the\nnorth-eastern kingdom of Angmar. More and more people fled from the\nNorth, and although Angmar was defeated by the beginning of the third\nmillennium of Third Age, Arnor was no more. Its people were scattered,\nand its royalty decreased in number and fame; however they remained true\nto their Númenóreans descent. They became the Rangers of the North,\nprotecting the paths of the North from the menace from the East. As for\nGondor, it prospered for much of the Third Age. However in the beginning\nof its third millennium, this began to change. Gondor was assailed by\norcs and men from the nearby Mordor. For a long time, no one suspected\nthat the same force that had driven the attacks upon Arnor was now\nfighting Gondor.\n\nA thousand years earlier, several Wizards, known as the Istari, had come\nto Middle-earth: Curunir (Saruman), Mithrandir (Gandalf), Radagast, and\nothers of the Istari who went into the east of Middle-earth. Although it\nwas unknown to the peoples of Middle-earth, they were emissaries from\nthe West, sent on behalf of the Valar to help them to obtain their\nfreedom.  For many centuries they were silent, and little was\ndone by them apart from observation and counsel. However as the times\ndarkened, they decided to take action against a mysterious dark force\nwhich seemed to dwell in the middle of a giant forest called Mirkwood.\nDuring the attack, the force had fled to Mordor. It was Sauron, who was\npreviously thought to have perished. And in the same year, the One Ring\nwas found.\n\nSauron made war on Middle-earth again. In this war, the Heir of\nIsildur,Aragorn II Elessar, arose and led the host of the West to\nvictory at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, while Curunir is defeated\nand captured at Isengard. Then Mithrandir, the sons of Elrond and the\nHeir of Isildur lead the armies of good to the Black Gate of Mordor and\nengage the superior Mordor armies. But Frodo the Hobbit went to Mount\nDoom and destroyed the Ring, defeating Sauron.  After this, it was made clear that Gandalf bore the Red Ring,\nNarya. Galadriel and Elrond had the other two rings. And the Third Age\nends with the Keepers of the Three Rings departing over the Seas,\nbringing an end to the Eldar except in story and song."

    "title": "Ungoliant",
    "page_id": "2378",
    "text": "UNGOLIANT (Sindarin IPA: - “Dark Spider”) was a primordial taking the\nshape of a gigantic spider. She was initially an ally of Melkor in Aman,\nand for a short time in Middle-earth as well. She is the mother of\nShelob, and therefore the oldest, and first spider of the south,\npossibly even the first spider of Arda.\n\n\nBiography\n\nOrigins\n\n\n\nThe true origin of Ungoliant is unknown, and was not even known by the\nValar. It is said by some that she came from the Darkness itself that\nlies about Arda and was once an ally of Melkor when he looked down upon\nthe world with envy. Later, she changed her allegiance from him to\nherself, desiring only to be a mistress of her own insatiable craving to\ndevour all light - to feed her everlasting emptiness.\n\nEarly years\n\nWhen Melkor was defeated and imprisoned by the Lords of the West after\nthe first Elves awoke in Cuiviénen, Ungoliant escaped the attacks of the\nValar and the hunters of Oromë and fled to the southern part of Aman.\nThere, in a ravine south of the mountain Hyarmentir, she established her\ndark abode and took the physical form of a monstrous spider, and sucked\nup all the light she could find. After every feeding, she spun forth\ndark nets of gloom that strangled any light from entering her lair of\ndarkness. Yet she hungered for more of it: for although she hated light,\nshe craved its sustenance as well.\n\nAlliance with Melkor\n\nEventually, Melkor sought out Ungoliant in order to exact his revenge\nagainst the Valar and the Elves. He came to her and told her of his\nplans. Though she was tempted greatly by Melkor's plan for her to drink\nthe light of the Two Trees of Valinor, she feared the power of the Valar\nand was hesitant to accompany him. To mollify her, Melkor offered to\nsate her hunger with whatever she wished if she would aid him in his\nvengeance. She agreed, and they came shortly thereafter to Ezellohar,\nwhere she drained the Trees of their sap, poisoned them, and drank the\nWells of Varda dry. The Unlight produced by Ungoliant stymied the\npursuit of Oromë and Tulkas, and Melkor escaped to Middle-earth with\nher. However, her consumption of power of the Trees and the Wells caused\nher to swell to a size and shape so vast and hideous that even Melkor\nbegan to grow afraid.  When they arrived in Lammoth in Middle-earth,\nMelkor, now known as Morgoth, hoped to escape to the ruins of Angband\nwhere the remnants of his forces awaited him. Suspecting that he\nintended to leave his promise to her unfulfilled, Ungoliant demanded the\ngems that Morgoth had stolen from Formenos before they could reach\nAngband. She devoured them, and grew to an even more monstrous size. She\nthen demanded that Morgoth surrender to her the Silmarils. However,\nMorgoth refused, and she attacked him. Weaving her dark webs, she\nattempted to enmesh him in her nets and take the Silmarils by force.\nMorgoth gave out a terrible cry of pain as she attacked, which was heard\nby the Balrogs hibernating under the ruins of Angband. They awoke and\nimmediately rushed to the aid of their Lord, tearing apart Ungoliant's\nwebbing with their fiery whips and forcing her to break off her attack.\nShe fled, and the Balrogs prepared to pursue and destroy her, but they\nwere checked by Morgoth, who ordered them to return with him to Angband.\nUngoliant's attack upon Morgoth left an echoing scream ever after on the\nland that gave the area the name Lammoth, and it is said to this day\nthat when one screams in that place, the voice of the Dark Lord echoes\nback from the surrounding hills.\n\nFinal Years and Legacy\n\nDriven off by the Balrogs, Ungoliant fled to Nan Dungortheb, where she\nbred with the Great Spiders that dwelt there, increasing the terror and\npower of her kind. The creatures that later infested the area were her\nsurviving offspring and descendants, including her infamous daughter,\nShelob, who dwelt from the Second and Third Ages onwards on the borders\nof Mordor, as her last surviving child. It is said that Ungoliant\nultimately perished at her own hands when, in her ever growing and\neternal hunger, she eventually devoured herself. Others say\nUngoliant, after retreating to an isolated island in the Belegaer, was\nslain by Eärendil, and with her darkness destroyed, light came to many\nregions from which it had long been hid. Towards the end of the First\nAge, she had captured the sun (Arien/Urwendi) with her gloom nets and\nEarendil encountered her on his journey across the seas on the Vingilot.\nEarendil ultimately freed Urwendi freeing the Magic Sun.Similarly,\nTolkien projected a tale wherein Ungoliant ensnared the Sun in her webs\nwhile it sailed under the earth: with the result that the Sun was no\nlonger enchanted, only the Moon: Urwendi imprisoned by Móru (upset out\nof the boat by Melko and only the Moon has been magic since). The Faring\nForth and the Battle of Erumáni would release her and rekindle the Magic\nSun.\n\nTolkien, J. R. R.; John D. Rateliff. The History of the Hobbit: Mr\nBaggins and Return to Bag-End: Mr Baggins v. 1 (Kindle Locations\n7303-7306). HarperCollins Publishers. Kindle Edition.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name _Ungoliant_ in Quenya is UNGWELIANTË, which means “Dark\nSpider”, from _ungwë_ (“dark”) and _liantë_ (“spider”). UNGOLIANT is\nthe Sindarin translation of her Quenya name.\n\nOther names\n\nThe Eldar called her VIRILOMË (WIRILOMË in Vanyarin) or\nGLOOMWEAVER. In Sindarin, this name is translated into\nGWERLUM.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\nUngoliant was mentioned in _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_ when\nRadagast tells Gandalf about his encounter with the Great Spiders\nresiding in Mirkwood, deducing that they are “some kind of spawn of\nUngoliant”."

However, the deeds of Beren and\nLúthien, defeating Sauron at Tol-in-Gaurhoth and retrieving a Silmaril\nfrom Angband, convinced Maedhros that Morgoth was not invincible. In the\nyear 468 of the Years of the Sun in the First Age, Maedhros began\nbuilding an alliance that he believed capable of taking the war to\nThangorodrim, known as the Union of Maedhros.\n\nUnder the command of Maedhros, all the Elves of Beleriand, as well as\nthe Edain, Dwarves, and the newly arrived Easterlings were invited to\ncombine in arms and fight against Morgoth. Unfortunately, the Oath of\nFëanor and the evil deeds done by the Sons of Fëanor to fulfill it\ncaused the Union to have less strength than it could have had. For\nOrodreth, the Lord of Nargothrond, remembering the deeds of Celegorm and\nCurufin that indirectly resulted in the death of Lord Finrod Felagund,\nsent no aid to the alliance. Against Orodreth's will however, a small\ncompany under the command of Gwindor went from Nargothrond. Their hope\nwas to avenge the capture of Gwindor's brother Gelmir during the Dagor\nBragollach. Worse yet, from Doriath there came only Mablung and Beleg,\nwho wished to take part in the great deeds they knew were to come. For\nThingol, King of Doriath, had in his possession the Silmaril recovered\nby Beren and Lúthien, and the Sons of Fëanor sent to him a haughty\ndemand for its surrender. Thingol however, was both insulted by the\ndemand and had begun to lust for the Silmaril. Thus, against the counsel\nof Melian, he refused to surrender it. As a result, Celegorm and Curufin\nvowed openly to destroy Doriath should they emerge victorious from the\nbattle against Morgoth. Therefore Thingol enhanced the guard at his\nborders and sent no troops to aid Maedhros.\n\nThe Union divided its strength into two separate forces to attack\nAngband. Under Maedhros in the east were gathered the remainder of the\nSons of Fëanor, the Elves and Men of Himring under Maedhros and Bór, the\nmen of Amon ereb under Caranthir and Ulfang, and the Dwarves of Nogrod\nand Belegost. Under Fingon in the west were gathered the Elves and Men\nof Hithlum, the Elves of the Falas, the Haladin of Brethil, the\ncompanies sent from Nargothrond and the two Elves of Doriath, Beleg and\nMablung. The plan was for Maedhros's host, the slightly greater of the\ntwo, to march openly across Anfauglith and draw out the main army of\nAngband, after which Fingon's host would attack from the Ered\nWethrin and crush the armies of Morgoth between the two forces. They\nwould then seal the doors of Angband and, hopefully, drive Morgoth\nunderground forever. The Union first cleared Beleriand and Dorthonion\nfrom the Orcs, and then gathered to assault Angband. However, these\nattacks alerted Morgoth to the existence of the Union, and he took\ncounsel against it.\n\nMorgoth learned of the battle plan of the Eldar from his spies, and\nsought to prevent Maedhros's forces from meeting with Fingon's. To that\nend, he sent a gigantic force of his own, one which included Glaurung\nand his numerous fire-breathing brood, to destroy Maedhros's host.\nFingon's troops eventually settled in the woods of Ered Wethrin to await\nthe coming of Maedhros's forces, not knowing that they had been\nattacked. Upon the arrival of Fingon's forces to Ered Wethrin, smoke and\nfire poured forth from Thangorodrim and the Iron Mountains. Fingon thus\nknew that Morgoth had become aware of his forces, and doubt began to\ngrow on him. Just at that moment however, Turgon arrived unexpectedly\nwith an army ten thousand strong from Gondolin, and hope was renewed in\nthe heart of the Elven host.\n\nAware of both the location of Fingon's troops and the strategy the elves\nhoped to employ, Morgoth sent a great force of Orcs from Angband to meet\nFingon's host. In actuality, this force was but a small portion of the\narmies Morgoth had prepared, and was ultimately little more than bait.\nFor Morgoth intended for this decoying force to draw out Fingon's army,\nand then to strengthen it when Fingon came from the hills to meet it.\nBut Fingon, wary of the guile of Morgoth, ignored the taunts of the Orcs\nand kept his forces hidden. Seeing this, the captain of the Orcish host\nsent out riders with tokens of parley. With them was Gelmir, Gwindor's\nbrother of Nargothrond, whom the Orcs had blinded. To provoke the Elvish\nhost, they dismembered Gelmir within sight of the Ered Wethrin and then\nkilled him, threatening to do the same with their other Elvish thralls.\nUnfortunately, Gwindor himself was in the forefront of the Elvish host,\nand he witnessed the cruel murder of his brother. Insane with grief and\nrage, he broke ranks and charged the heralds with the company from\nNargothrond and slew them, driving deep into the center of the Orcish\nhost. Seeing that his troops could not be restrained, Fingon sounded the\ncharge, and committed his entire force to the battle. Here, Morgoth's\ndesigns nearly went astray, for the onset of the Noldor charge was so\nswift and terrible that the Orcish host was destroyed before it could be\nstrengthened. At the forefront of the battle were Gwindor and his\ncompany, and their wrath was so great that they burst through Morgoth's\nouter gates and slew the guard in the very courts of Angband.\n\nIt was said that Morgoth trembled as Gwindor's company pounded upon his\ngates, but surrounded by a sea of enemies they became trapped in the\ncourt, and all were slain except Gwindor who was taken, for Fingon could\nnot come to their aid. Then, from many hidden doors in Thangorodrim,\nMorgoth let forth his main host. Fingon's army was driven back from the\nwalls of Angband with great loss. The Men of Brethil that comprised the\nrearguard were nearly all slain, along with Haldir, Lord of the Haladin.\nThe fourth day of the conflict was the official beginning of Nírnaeth\nArnoediad, and Fingon's forces continued to retreat with their\ncasualties mounting. At the start of the fifth day however, Fingon's\nforces were joined by Turgon, who had withheld most of his troops from\nthe foolhardy assault. The phalanx of Turgon broke through the lines of\nthe Enemy, and met with the guard of Fingon, along with Húrin son of\nGaldor. With Turgon's help, Fingon's forces managed to beat back the\nhost of Angband enough to begin an orderly retreat. \n\nHowever, the fortune of the Eldar then took another turn for the worse.\nFor while Fingon's armies had been fighting Morgoth's forces on the\nplains of Anfauglith, Maedhros had been defeated by the armies that\nMorgoth had sent against his host. To make matters worse, Maedhros had\nbeen betrayed by Ulfang, one of the sons of Uldor, who had summoned a\ngreat force of evil men from the surrounding hills to attack the elven\nhost. Reeling from the unexpected treachery and the continual assault of\nMorgoth's dragons, the eastern host would have been utterly destroyed if\nnot for the valor of the Dwarves of Belegost. For they were naturally\nable to withstand the dragons' fire better than Elves or Men, and\nmoreover they wore great iron masks that gave them additional\nprotection. These dwarves formed the rearguard of the eastern host, and\nallowed the remaining Elves and Men to escape the dragons. Azaghâl, King\nof the Dwarves of Belegost, gathered his forces and formed a ring around\nGlaurung to keep him at bay. Such was their strength and the keenness of\ntheir axes that even Glaurung's armored hide was not invulnerable to\ntheir blows. Enraged, Glaurung struck down Azaghâl and crawled over him,\nbut with his last strength Azaghâl ran a dagger through Glaurung's\nbelly, and the dragon fled in pain. With him fled all the beasts of\nMorgoth. In a solemn ceremony the Dwarves picked up their fallen leader,\nforgetting about the battle, and they marched his corpse home. Their\nwrath was so great that none troubled them. Their sacrifice allowed all\nseven of the Sons of Fëanor to escape, though their host was routed and\nscattered throughout Ossiriand.\n\n\n\nAfter defeating Maedhros, Morgoth's eastern host had made haste to to\njoin the battle against Fingon's forces, and arrived as the elven forces\nhad begun to withdraw. As they engaged the retreating Elves, Gothmog\nhimself arrived on the field with his Troll guard and engaged Fingon in\nsingle combat. The High Elven King managed to hold his own against the\nHigh Captain of Angband until another Balrog restrained Fingon from\nbehind. Gothmog then clove Fingon's head with his Black Axe, and the\nfield of battle was soon utterly lost. Seeing this, Húrin begged Turgon\nto return to Gondolin, and told the King that he and his men would cover\nthe Elven retreat. Huor, Húrin and the remaining Men of Dor-lómin then\nformed a living wall across the Fens of Serech, buying time for Turgon\nto escape with most of the surviving Elves of the north. The warriors of\nDor-lómin were all slain, and Huor fell with his eye pierced by a\npoisoned arrow. Finally Húrin was left to fight alone, wielding the\ngreat axe of an Orc captain two handed. He managed to slay seventy of\nhis foes, including a great number of Gothmog's troll guard, falling at\nlast after his axe withered away from the caustic troll blood upon it.\nGothmog then pulled Hurin out from under the mountain Orcs and Trolls\nthat he slew, bound him, and dragged him to Angband with mockery.\n\n\nAftermath\n\nAfter Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the ability of Elves and Men to make war\nagainst Morgoth was broken. Morgoth's victory was essentially complete,\nas he had destroyed all the people of Hithlum and had scattered the sons\nof Fëanor away from Himring. Morgoth's orcs razed all of Beleriand\nexcept for Doriath, which was still protected by the Girdle of Melian,\nand sacked the havens of the Falas. Nargothrond was also still free, but\nMorgoth gave little thought to either it or Doriath, knowing that the\ntwo remaining Elven kingdoms were no threat to him.\n\nMorgoth betrayed his servants the Easterlings and trapped them in\nHithlum under penalty of death, denying them the fertile lands of\nBeleriand. Still Morgoth knew fear, for Turgon, now High King of the\nÑoldor after the death of Fingon in the battle, had survived, and his\ncity of Gondolin was still unknown to Morgoth. Hoping to discover the\nwhereabouts of Turgon, Morgoth summoned Hurin to him, seeking from him\nthe location of Gondolin. But Hurin mocked Morgoth and refused to betray\nTurgon. Morgoth then laid a terrible curse upon him and his kin, and\nbound Hurin to a chair upon Thangoridrim to witness the curse\nunfold.\n\n\nAn alternate version\n\nA first and older version of the story was drawn by Christopher Tolkien\nprimarily from a text called the _Grey Annals_, although the Quenta\nSilmarillion was used as well. But in the writing of the long Narn i\nChîn Húrin, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote a new version of the battle which\npostdates both the GA and QS accounts. Christopher Tolkien did not\nincorporate the major changes of the new version into the Silmarillion\ntext, although he did take some phrasing and description from it.\n\nIn the earlier version of the battle, Morgoth sent no armies against the\nforces of Maedhros, and instead Uldor delayed Maedhros's host with a\ntreacherous warning of a false assault from Angband. Maedhors eventually\nrealized what he believed to be a mistake on Uldor's part, and his host\nat last arrived to aid Fingon in the fifth day as Turgon's forces did.\nMaedhros's forces assailed the armies of Angband in the rear, and\nMorgoth was forced to release his reserves, including his Balrogs,\nGlaurung and his brood, and Gothmog the Lord of Balrogs. It was said in\nthis version that the Elves might still have won, but Ulfang and his\nEasterlings betrayed Maedhros, and summoned a great strength of evil Men\nfrom the surrounding hills, routing the host of Maedhros.\n\nThe major difference was that Morgoth defeats the Elves much more\nhandily in the newer version than he did in the old one. The entire\nelement of the “Machinations of Uldor” delaying Maedhros's march is\nremoved, and Morgoth sends a second force to meet Maedhros and prevent\nhim from joining with the other elf lords. This version also lacks the\nnearly explicit statement that the Elves could have won had it not been\nfor the treachery of men.\n\nChristopher Tolkien did not venture a guess on why his father made these\nchanges, but it may be that he felt the Elves did much better against\nMorgoth than they reasonably should have (especially given the extreme\nlength and difficulty of the later War of Wrath). This is all\nspeculation, however. It was explicitly stated several times both by\nin-universe characters and Tolkien in the Silmarillion that the Elves\nhad absolutely no chance of defeating Morgoth unaided, so it is possible\nthat the changes were made to concur with this line of thinking.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_NÍRNAETH ARNOEDIAD_ was Sindarin for 'Tears Unnumbered'."

    "title": "Glaurung",
    "page_id": "2448",
    "text": "GLAURUNG was the first terrestrial, fire-breathing Dragon in\nMiddle-earth. He is known as the Father of Dragons.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Years\n\nAfter suffering a number of defeats at the hands of the Ñoldor in\nBeleriand, Morgoth came to realize that his armies of Orcs were no match\nfor the Noldor unaided. As such, he began to experiment with ways to\ncreate new, deadlier creatures for use in his armies. Glaurung was the\nresult of these experiments. After a century of brooding and growing in\nthe dark pits of Angband, Glaurung first emerged in FA 260 and attacked\nthe Elves maintaining the Siege of Angband. Though Glaurung was not of\nthe winged race that would later arise, he was the greatest terror of\nhis time. He burned and ravaged Ard-galen, the land of the Elves in\nHithlum and Dorthonion. However, he was not yet at his full strength, so\nwas driven back by Fingon, the prince of Hithlum at that time, and his\narchers. Morgoth was displeased with Glaurung for revealing himself\nbefore he had grown to full strength, as Morgoth had planned for\nGlaurung's existence to be a complete surprise.\n\nTo Glaurung, this attack was merely a youthful testing of his strength.\nTerrible as he was to the Elves, the armor of his scales was still\nvulnerable to the bite of weapons. However, despite his untimely foray,\nMorgoth's plans were not disrupted.\n\nWar upon the Elves\n\nDagor Bragollach\n\n\n\nGlaurung was contained in Angband for another two centuries before he\nwas again loosed during the Fourth Battle of the Battles of Beleriand.\nKnown as the Dagor Bragollach for the fires unleashed by Morgoth from\nthe Iron Mountains, Glaurung in full power led Melkor's forces against\nthe High Elves of Beleriand. Now fully grown, none could withstand his\nmight, and with the Balrogs at his side, Glaurung led the Orcs to an\noverwhelming victory and broke the siege of Angband.\n\nNirnaeth Arnoediad\n\n In the fifth battle, the\nNirnaeth Arnoediad, Glaurung caused even more destruction, as he had\nfathered a brood of lesser Dragons to follow him into battle. So a great\narmy of Elves and Men fell before the onslaught, for none could\nwithstand the Dragonfire save the Dwarves of Belegost, who had come to\nbattle a common foe.\n\nAfter the Elven and Edain armies had been broken, Morgoth used Glaurung\nto hold the territories he gained; but force in battle was not the only\npower the monster knew. He brought many under his sway with the binding\npower of his serpent eye and hypnotic Dragon Spell.\n\nThe Sack of Nargothrond\n\n\n\nAfter Glaurung aided Morgoth during the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, he\nwas given the assignment to complete the Sack of Nargothrond, one of the\nElven fortresses in Beleriand. Glaurung came upon Nargothrond with great\nforce, and sacked the kingdom easily. He faced Túrin, son of Húrin, at\nthe gate and so he froze Túrin with his eyes. Túrin heard the screams of\nFinduilas, daughter of Orodreth, as he stood there. When the captives\nhad been taken away, Glaurung unfroze Túrin and gave him two choices:\nthe first to follow Finduilas, and the second to aid his mother and\nsister, who were suffering in Dor-lómin. Túrin chose the latter, and in\nthis way he was deceived by the dragon, for his mother and sister were\nliving well in Doriath. Glaurung then gathered up all the treasures of\nFelagund and hoarded them deep within Nargothrond's underground halls,\nhe then sat atop his hoard, guarding it jealously, and so he rested.\n\nLast Years\n\n\n\nGlaurung received knowledge of Morwen and Nienor's departure to seek\ntheir family members. In the forest where they were travelling, Glaurung\nfound Nienor and caused her to lose her mind. This caused her to run\nthrough the forest “like a deer”. Soon after this, Túrin found her\ncrying on Finduilas's grave. Not knowing that she was his sister, Túrin\nnamed her Níniel (Tear maiden) and took her to his home with the folk of\nBrandir. There they lived for the next three years, during which they\nfell in love.\n\nDeath\n\n\n\nAfter those years, Glaurung attacked the area around their home. Túrin\nresolved to kill the dragon. Two men went with him. One became afraid\nand fled, and the other was crushed by rocks. However, Túrin was able to\nkill Glaurung by thrusting his sword, Gurthang, into Glaurung's belly.\nGlaurung felt his death wound and screamed. When the dragon's blood\ntouched Túrin, he fell into a swoon. Glaurung screamed until his\nstrength was gone. Nienor found him there, with Túrin beside him. With\nhis last breath, Glaurung gave Nienor her memory back, and died. Shortly\nthereafter, Nienor jumped into the river below, and Túrin awoke and\nthrew himself on his sword.\n\n\nEarliest version\n\nIn _The Book of Lost Tales II_, _Glorund_ was the early name of\nGlaurung.\n\n\nTrivia\n\nGlaurung's basic concept of character shows several resemblances with\nDraugluin, the father of werewolves.\n\nGlaurung functions as the Silmarillion's tertiary antagonist, appearing\nmore often than either Sauron or Gothmog and functions as the main\nantagonist of The Children of Húrin.\n\nTurin's killing of Glaurung greatly resembles the killing of the dragon\nFafnir by Siegfried, who, knowing that Fafnir's scales were\nimpenetrable, dug a hole and waited for Fafnir to pass over it, allowing\nSiegfried to stab into the dragon's vulnerable belly. Also like\nGlaurung, Fafnir's last words were a message to poison Siegfriend's\ntrust in the ones he loved."

    "title": "Atomic bomb",
    "page_id": "2599",
    "text": "The '''Atomic bomb '''was an extremely destructive\nuranium-type nuclear weapon which was used during the end of World War\nII. Atomic Bombs were invented by the Manhattan Project between 1942 and\n1945, during World War II. They exploited the fact that Uranium is\nunstable in more than tiny quantities and will naturally begin a cascade\nof ever-accelerating reactions in which the atoms fall apart\nexplosively. Neutrons released trigger other atoms of uranium to\ncollapse and soon the whole thing explodes. The United States used these\nweapons to end the war, and the bombs became both a deterrent to attack\nin the 20th and 21st centuries, and a threat used by the two major\nsuperpowers during the Cold War (the USA and USSR).\n\n\nThe A-Bomb and the One Ring\n\nMany people thought that the One Ring was the symbol standing for the\nATOMIC BOMB. This is incorrect; Tolkien began writing _The Lord of the\nRings_ in 1937, long before the start of the Manhattan Project. Some say\nthat though it isn't the symbol of the Atomic Bomb, it could symbolise\nsomething like it. Besides that, Tolkien loathed allegory in all its\nforms, so it is highly unlikely that he made this reference. Many have\nfound in Tolkien's masterpiece a story that condemns power, destructive\nacts, autocracy, and intolerance. Although others think that the\nopposite could be lurking just underneath. \n\nTolkien's famous quote about how he disliked allegory has had profound\nand rippling effects throughout the decades on Tolkien scholarship and\nthe way his books have been read. However, it could be argued that in\nseeking to insist that he did not write an “allegory”, he in fact\nreduced the “applicability” of his work. His statement \"I think many\nconfuse _applicability_ with ''allegory ''may have been built on a basis\nof false mutual-exclusivity. There is, indeed, a certain pattern of\none-to-one substitutions that is of interest when reading, _Lord of the\nRings_, although it is one that requires coming at the story from a\nslightly different angle than usual.\n\nOther interpretations for the Ring have came up too: Tom Shippey has\ncompared it to a narcotic drug, and the ring-bearers behavior to an\naddiction; Adam Roberts has likened it to a wedding ring, playing on\nTolkien's use of the world “bound”; Robert Eaglestone has related it to\ntechnologically enabled invisibility, trough, in Tolkien's day,\nbureaucracy, and, more recently, trough the internet and CCTV.\n\nThat being said, Tolkien intensely disliked the weaponry of modern war,\noften referring to it as 'Orc-work'. His comment on the airplanes, which\nhis son Christopher piloted during World War II: “My sentiments are more\nor less those that Frodo would have had if he discovered some Hobbits\nlearning to ride Nazgûl-birds 'for the liberation of the Shire'.”\n(Carpenter, Humphrey, ed., JRR Tolkien, author, _Letters of J.R.R.\nTolkien_ (USA: Houghton Mifflin, 2000 AD), Letter 100, p. 115.) He\ncondemned the atomic bomb in a letter to his son Christopher Tolkien, on\n9 August 1945: “The news today about 'Atomic Bombs' is so horrifying one\nis stunned. The utter folly of these lunatic physicists to consent to do\nsuch work for war-purposes: calmly plotting the destruction of the\nworld!” (Carpenter, Humphrey, ed., J.R.R. Tolkien, author, ''Letters of\nJ.R.R. Tolkien ''(USA: Houghton Mifflin, 2000 AD), Letter 102, p. 116.)\n\nAn Act of Mass Destruction\n\nOn the day the Enola Gay dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, it came\nas a genuine surprise. The Japanese radar had picked up the planes, but\nbecause there were only seen to be a small number, three, and air raids\nwarnings were cancelled; due to the demand on their resources by the\nwar, the Japanese could not commit themselves to intercepting, or\nproperly identifying the purpose of, small formations.\n\nWhen the bomb, followed by the Fat Man at Nagasaki three days later, was\ndropped, the destruction in the cities was total, and the war was\nconclusively ended. America was by then the unchallenged military power\nin the world.\n\nLet us establish the equivalents for each of these details. That Sam,\nFrodo, and Gollum are akin to the three planes is obvious enough: small\ntargets, sneaking in, detected but allocated no significant resources\nafterwards due to the war still being in full swing. The Ring is\nundiscovered.\n\nNow when the Ring is dropped (accidentally) its end is a purposeful and\ndesired act of mass destruction. Take what Sam sees upon exiting Mount\nDoom: “and then all passed. Towers fell and mountains slid; walls\ncrumbled and melted, crashing down; vast spires of smoke and spouting\nsteams went billowing up, up, until they toppled like and overwhelming\nwave and its wild crest curled and came in foaming down upon the land”.\n\nA beautiful description, but one, of an event involving enormous,\nsweeping, total destruction. Moreover, take Tolkien's description of\nwhat happened when Sauron realises what was going on: “throughout his\nrealm a tremor ran, his slaves quailed, and his armies halted, and his\ncaptains suddenly steerless, bereft of will, wavered and despaired”. It\nis an event with society-wide implications: it is the event that will\nwin the war, not just due to its physically destructive effect, but also\nbecause of the effect of total demoralisation.\n\nAfterwards, Aragorn II establishes the promised autocracy: he mimics the\nglobal activities of post-war Allies as he “pardons” the Easterlings,\n“gives” the slaves of Mordor their land, and generally calls on people\nto participate in “perceiving the mercy and justice of the King”. That\nis instead of demanding reparations and punishing economic hardships on\nthose who waged war on the West, he begins with a clean slate and makes\nactive efforts to build wholesome, healthy economies, just as the Allies\ndid with Japan and Germany and financial assistance."

    "title": "History of Arda",
    "page_id": "2652",
    "text": "The HISTORY OF ARDA is divided into three time periods, known as the\nYears of the Lamps, Years of the Trees and Years of the Sun. A separate,\noverlapping chronology divides the history into 'Ages of the Children of\nIlúvatar'. The first such Age began with the Awakening of the Elves\nduring the Years of the Trees and continued for the first six centuries\nof the Years of the Sun. All the subsequent Ages took place during the\nYears of the Sun. Most Middle-earth stories take place in the first\nthree Ages of the Children of Ilúvatar.\n\n\nBasic history\n\nMusic of the Ainur\n\n_Main article: Ainulindalë_\n\nThe supreme deity is called Eru Ilúvatar. In the beginning, Ilúvatar\ncreated spirits named the Ainur. Ilúvatar made divine music with them.\nMelkor, Tolkien's equivalent of Satan, who was then one of the Ainur,\nbroke the harmony of the music, until Ilúvatar began a third theme which\nthe Ainur could not comprehend since they were not the source of it. The\nessence of their song symbolized the history of the whole universe and\nthe Children of Ilúvatar who were to dwell in it - the Men and the\nElves.\n\nThen Ilúvatar created Eä, the universe itself, and the Ainur formed\nwithin it Arda, the Earth, “globed within the void”: the world together\nwith the airs is set apart from _Kuma_, the “void” without. The first 15\nof the Ainur who descended to Arda, and the most powerful ones, were\ncalled Valar, and the Ainur of lesser might who followed were called\nMaiar.\n\nYears of the Lamps\n\n_Main article: Years of the Lamps_\n\nThe Years of the Lamps began shortly after the creation of Arda by the\nValar. After the Valar entered the world, there was a light veiling the\nground. The Valar took this light and concentrated it into two large\nlamps, Iluin and Ormal. The Vala Aulë forged great towers, one in the\nfurthest north, and another in the deepest south. The Valar lived in the\nmiddle, at the island of Almaren. The end of the Years of the Lamps was\nmarked by Melkor's destruction of the Two Lamps.\n\nYears of the Trees\n\n_Main article: Years of the Trees_\n\nShortly after the destruction of the Two Lamps, Yavanna made the Two\nTrees, named Telperion (the silver tree) and Laurelin (the gold tree) in\nthe land of Aman, where the Valar now lived. The Trees illuminated Aman,\nleaving Middle-earth in darkness, save the light of the stars.\n\nThe Elves awoke in Cuiviénen, and were soon approached by the Valar, but\nalso by Melkor. This event marked the beginning of the First Age. Many,\nthough not all, of the Elves were persuaded to go on the Great Journey\nwestwards towards Aman. Along the journey several groups of Elves\ntarried, notably the Nandor and the Sindar. The three clans who arrived\nat Aman were the Vanyar, Ñoldor, and the Teleri.\n\nThe Valar had captured Melkor and placed him in chains in Aman. After he\nappeared to repent and was released, Melkor sowed great discord among\nthe elves, and stirred up rivalry between the Ñoldorin King Finwë's two\nsons Fëanor and Fingolfin. Out of jealousy and hatred for the Silmarils\nthree gems crafted by Feänor that contained the light of the Two Trees\nMelkor stole them, killing Finwë, who was guarding the jewels. Then,\nwith the help of the creature Ungoliant, he destroyed the Two Trees and\nescaped to Middle-earth.\n\nBitter at the Valar's inactivity, Feänor and his house left to pursue\nMelkor, cursing him with the name 'Morgoth'. A larger host, commanded by\nFingolfin, followed him. They reached the Telerin port-city of\nAlqualondë, but their Lord forbade them to use the Telerin ships. Feänor\ndecided to take them by force and thus the first Kinslaying ensued and\nonly by the strength in numbers were the Teleri overcome and their fair\nships stolen.\n\nFeänor's host sailed on the vessels, and burned them when he arrived in\nMiddle-earth. Left behind, Fingolfin and his company crossed over to\nMiddle-earth through the Helcaraxë (also known as the Grinding Ice) in\nthe far north. Around the same time, but separately, Galadriel and\nCeleborn set sail for Middle-earth without the permission of the Valar.\n\nYears of the Sun\n\nThe Years of the Sun began when the Valar made the Sun and the Moon out\nof the final fruit of Laurelin and the final flower of Telperion and set\nthem in the heavens. Thereafter, years were reckoned in Middle-earth as\nthey are in our own real world. The First Age of the Children of\nIlúvatar continued into this new reckoning of time.\n\nAges of the Children of Ilúvatar\n\nFirst Age\n\n_Main article: First Age_\n\nFeänor was soon lost in an attack on Morgoth's Balrog s - but his sons\nsurvived, and founded realms the kingdoms of the House of Fingolfin.\n\nThe Long Peace lasted hundreds of years; during which time Men arrived\nover the Blue Mountains, but the peace was not to last; and one by one\nthe kingdoms even the hidden ones of Gondolin and Doriath eventually\nfell.\n\nAt the end of the age, all that remained of free Elves and Men in\nBeleriand was a settlement at the mouth of the River Sirion and another\nsettlement on the isle of Balar. Eärendil had possession of a Silmaril,\nwhich his wife Elwing's ancestors Beren and Lúthien had taken from\nMorgoth, but the Feänorians had a claim on the Silmaril still and so\nthere was another Kinslaying. Eärendil and Elwing took the Silmaril\nacross the Great Sea, to beg the Valar for aid.\n\nThey responded. Melkor was exiled into the Void; and most of his works\nwere destroyed. This came at a terrible cost, as Beleriand itself was\nsunk.\n\nSecond Age\n\n_Main article: Second Age_\n\nThe men who had remained faithful were given the island of Númenor, in\nthe middle of the Great Sea whilst the Elves were allowed to return\nhome.\n\nThe Númenóreans became great seafarers, but were jealous of the elves\nfor their immortality. Meanwhile, in Middle-earth it became apparent\nthat Sauron, Morgoth's chief servant, was still active. He worked with\nElven smiths in Eregion on the craft of rings, and forged the One Ring\nto dominate them all. The Elves noticed this and removed theirs.\n\nTowards the end of the age, the Númenóreans were growing increasingly\nproud. King Ar-Pharazôn humbled even Sauron and brought him to Númenor\nas a hostage. Sauron worked his way into Pharazôn's court, and became\nhigh priest in a cult of Morgoth. Eventually, Pharazôn was persuaded to\nattempt to invade Aman, promised that immortality would result.\n\nAmandil, chief of the Faithful, sailed westward to warn the Valar of\nthis. His son Elendil and grandsons Isildur and Anárion prepared to flee\neastwards. When the King's men had landed on Aman, the Valar lay down\ntheir guardianship of the world and called for Ilúvatar to intervene.\n\nThe world was changed into a sphere, and the straight road from\nMiddle-earth to Aman was broken. Númenor was utterly destroyed, as was\nthe fair body of Sauron. Elendil and his sons founded the realms of\nGondor and Arnor.\n\nSauron arose again and challenged them. The Elves allied with the Men to\nform the Last Alliance, which defeated him. His great One Ring was taken\nfrom him by Isildur but not destroyed.\n\nThird Age\n\n_Main article: Third Age_\n\nThe Third Age saw the rise in power of the realms of Arnor and Gondor,\nand their fall. Arnor was divided into three petty Kingdoms, which fell\none by one, whilst Gondor fell into the civil war of the Kin-strife,\nplague, Wainriders, and the Corsairs of Umbar.\n\nBy the time of _The Lord of the Rings_, Sauron had recovered again, and\nwas seeking the One Ring. He discovered that it was in the possession of\na Hobbit named Baggins, and sent out the Ringwraiths to find him and\nretrieve it.\n\nThe Ring-bearer, Frodo Baggins, is sent to Rivendell, where it is\ndecided that the One Ring must be destroyed once and for all and it can\nonly be unmade in the fiery depths of Mount Doom where it was forged. He\nsets out on this quest with eight other companions who comprise _The\nFellowship of the Ring_.\n\nAfter a long and difficult journey, he and Sam Gamgee finally complete\nthe mission, succeeding largely due to an unforeseen event that was out\nof their control. Sauron is thus destroyed forever and they are lauded\nas heroes.\n\nAragorn takes his place as King of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and\nGondor, at last restoring the line of Kings from the Stewards of Gondor.\n\nFourth Age and After\n\n_Main article: Fourth Age_\n\nThe end of the Third Age marked the end of the involvement of the Elves\nin Human affairs, despite a short-lived revival of Elven presence in\nGondor under Legolas. Most Elves who have lingered in Middle-earth leave\nfor Valinor. Those who remain behind “fade” and eventually diminish; a\nsimilar fate occurs for the Dwarves. Although Lonely Mountain (Erebor)\nbecomes an ally of the Reunited Kingdom, there are indications\nKhazad-dûm is refounded, and a colony is established under Gimli in the\nWhite Mountains (Ered Nimrais). The dwarves become ever more reclusive\nand disappear from human history. Morgoth's creatures are almost wiped\nout and never recover. During the later Fourth Age, as the heirs of the\nNúmenóreans forget their heritage, the tales of the earlier Ages become\nlegends and are eventually considered fantasies.\n\nSince then, Tolkien wrote that the ages have quickened, and he estimated\nthat the 20th century was in the Sixth or Seventh age.\n\nit:Storia di Arda ru:История Арды"

    "text": "The TWO TREES OF VALINOR also known as the TREES OF THE VALAR,''' '''the\nTWO TREES: '''Laurelin '''(the Gold Tree) and '''Telperion '''(the\nSilver Tree), brought light into the Land of the Valar in ancient times.\nThey were destroyed by Melkor and Ungoliant, but their last flower and\nfruit were made by the Valar into the Sun and the Moon.\n\n\nCreation and destruction\n\nThe first sources of light for all of Arda were two enormous Lamps,\nIlluin, the silver one to the north, and Ormal, the golden one to the\nsouth. These were cast down and destroyed by Melkor. Afterward, the\nValar went to Valinor and Yavanna sang into existence the Two Trees,\nsilver Telperion and golden Laurelin. Telperion was considered male and\nLaurelin female. The Trees sat on the hill Ezellohar located outside\nValimar. They grew in the presence of all of the Valar, watered by the\ntears of Nienna.\n\n Each tree was a source of\nlight: Telperion's silver and Laurelin's gold. Telperion had dark leaves\n(silver on one side) and his silvery dew was collected as a source of\nwater and of light. Laurelin had gold-trimmed leaves and her dew was\nlikewise collected by Varda. One “day” lasted twelve hours. Each Tree,\nin turn, would give off light for seven hours (waxing to full brightness\nand then slowly waning again), so that at one hour each of “dawn” and\n“dusk” soft gold and silver light would be given off together.\n\nJealous, Melkor enlisted the help of the giant spider-creature Ungoliant\n(the mother of Shelob) to destroy the Two Trees. Concealed in Unlight,\nMelkor struck each Tree and the insatiable Ungoliant devoured whatever\nlife and light remained in them.\n\nAgain Yavanna sang and Nienna wept, but they succeeded only in reviving\nTelperion's last flower (to become the Moon) and Laurelin's last fruit\n(to become the Sun). These were assigned to lesser spirits, male Tilion\nand female Arien, after the 'genders' of the Trees themselves. This\nis why, in _The Lord of the Rings_, the Sun is usually referred to as\n“she” and the moon as “he”.\n\nHowever, the true light of the Trees, before their poisoning by\nUngoliant, was said to afterwards reside only in the Silmarils.\n\n\nTelperion's descendants\n\nBecause the Elves that first came to Valinor especially loved Telperion,\nYavanna made a second tree like it to stand in the city of Tirion where\nthe Vanyar and Ñoldor dwelt together at first. This tree,\nnamed Galathilion, was identical to Telperion except that it gave no\nlight of its own. It had many seedlings, one of which was planted in the\nisle of Tol Eressëa (named CELEBORN).\n\nIn the Second Age, a seedling of Celeborn was brought as a gift to the\nNúmenóreans - this was Nimloth, the White Tree of Númenor. It lasted\nthrough the majority of the realm's duration, but when Sauron took\ncontrol of the island he commanded King Ar-Pharazôn to chop it down.\n\nFortunately Isildur managed to save a single fruit of that tree. Of this\nfruit later came the White Tree of Gondor.\n\n\nInternal significance\n\nThe Two Trees of Valinor existed at a time when the only other source of\nlight was the stars (which had been created for the Elves' benefit by\nVarda from the dews collected from the Two Trees). When three Elven\nambassadors were brought to see Valinor for themselves, in order that\nthe Elves might be convinced to come to Valinor, it seems that the Two\nTrees affected them most significantly.\n\nIn particular Thingol is said to have been motivated in the Great\nJourney by his desire to see the Light of Valinor again (until he finds\ncontentment in the light he sees in Melian's face). Also in later times,\nthe Elves would be divided between the _CALAQUENDI_ who had seen the\nlight of the Trees, and the _MORIQUENDI_ who hadn't; with the former\ngroup having found enlightenment and near rapture in the light they\nbeheld.\n\nThe Silmarillion repeatedly states that those Elves who saw the Two\nTrees were mighty, with the light of Aman in their faces. As vassals of\nthe Valar, the trees somehow bestowed otherworldy power and\nunderstanding on those who were exposed to them. Galadriel in particular\nhad an affinity to Laurelin, as her hair was said to have captured the\ngolden light of that tree. In turn this inspired Feanor to make the\njewels that could hold that same light; the Silmarils.\n\nThe whole of the history of the First Age is strongly affected by the\ndesire of many different characters to possess the Silmarils, which\ncontain the only remaining unsullied light of the Trees. Yet upon his\nflight from Valinor after destroying the light of the Two Trees, Melkor\nstole the Silmarils and sparked the Oath of Fëanor (who renamed Melkor\nMorgoth) and after many years the Valar embarked on the War of Wrath,\nWhich ended the First Age\n\nIn the Second and Third Ages, the White Trees of Númenor and of Gondor,\nwhose likeness descends from that of Telperion, have a mostly symbolic\nsignificance. They stand both as symbols of the kingdoms in question,\nand also as reminders of the ancestral alliance between the Dúnedain and\nthe Elves. Even in this late age the two trees are remembered by some.\nGandalf obviously remembers them with reverence, as he speaks of them to\nPippin.\n\n\nExternal significance\n\nTolkien, as a Roman Catholic, would have been exposed to the\nsignificance of light in Catholic symbolism. Trees were of special\nimportance to him - in his short story _Leaf by Niggle_, which in a\nsense was an elaborate allegory explaining his own creative process, the\nprotagonist spends his life painting a single Tree.\n\nThe Two Trees represent the recurrent 'gold and silver' concept of the\nlegendarium. They are created after the lamps Ormal and Illuin - and\nfrom the trees themselves, the Sun and Moon are later created.\n\nTolkien may have also gotten inspiration for the trees directly from the\nSun, which rises in the day (as Laurelin, the golden tree), and the moon\nwhich rises in the night (Telperion, the silver tree).\n\n\nEtymology\n\nBoth Telperion and Laurelin are said to have been given many names among\nwhich are the following: Laurelin was also given the names of MALINALDA\nand CULÚRIEN,''' '''while Telperion was also named '''Silpion '''and\nNINQUELÓTË. Telperion's name in Valarin, the language of the Valar, is\nsaid to have been _IBRÎNIÐILPATHÂNEZEL_; Laurelin's name is recorded as\n_TULUKHEDELGORÛS._\n\nIn early writings of Tolkien, Telperion's names were SILPION ,\nBANSIL, and BELTHIL.\n\n\nQuotations\n\n“Yet even as hope failed  Telperion bore at last upon a leafless\nbough one great flower of silver, and Laurelin a single fruit of gold.”\n- _The Silmarillion_\n\n“... and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of Feanor at their\nwork, while both the White Tree and Golden were in flower!” Gandalf to\nPippin, _The Two Towers_\n\n\nNotes\n\n-   Tolkien could have taken the creation of light mentioned in Genesis\n    as inspiration for the two trees, as both brought light into\n    Middle-earth and were turned into the moon and sun."

    "title": "The Book of Lost Tales Part One",
    "page_id": "2672",
    "text": "_'_The Book of Lost Tales Part One _'_(sometimes here abbreviated\n_THE BOOK OF LOST TALES 1_) (ISBN 978-0345375216) is the title of the\nfirst volume of Christopher Tolkien's 12-volume series _The History of\nMiddle-earth_, in which he analyses the unpublished manuscripts of his\nfather J. R. R. Tolkien.\n\nIt was completed in 1983. ''The Book of Lost Tales Part Two ''is its\nsequel and other half, which came a year later.\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nContent\n\n_The Book of Lost Tales_ contains the first versions of the stories\nwhich would later become _The Silmarillion_, and is notable because,\nwhile very primitive in style and content, it is very close to the later\nwork in many ways. Each of the Tales is followed by notes and a detailed\ncommentary by Christopher Tolkien.\n\nWhile many of the names in the book are identical or close to those in\nthe later versions, some of them bear almost no resemblance to their\nfinal forms. J. R. R. Tolkien changed names rather frequently, sometimes\nwith several new variants (rejected in turn) written in a single\nmanuscript. Confusingly, sometimes the name applied to one thing is\nlater used to refer to a different thing, the original use abandoned. As\nan example, the house of Elves called “Teleri” in _The Book of Lost\nTales_ is not the same as that in _The Silmarillion_ (see Teleri). The\noriginal usage of “Teleri” would eventually change until the name became\n“Vanyar”. Meanwhile, the house of Elves called “Solosimpi” would inherit\nthe name “Teleri”.\n\nThe framework for the book is that a mortal Man visits the Isle of Tol\nEressëa where the Elves live. In the earlier versions of the “Lost\nTales” this man is named Eriol, of some vague north European origin, but\nin later versions he becomes Ælfwine, an Englishman of the Middle-ages.\n\nThere are more changes visible within the book, and it is not internally\nconsistent, partially because even while still writing it Tolkien began\nrewriting earlier parts as his ideas about the world changed. The Tales\nwere eventually abandoned, but they were resurrected in part as the\n“Sketch of the Mythology” which would become _The Silmarillion_.\n\nFor publication, the book was split into two volumes: _The Book of Lost\nTales Part One_ and _The Book of Lost Tales Part Two_, but this is\nsimply an editorial division. Both volumes are separated into several\n“Lost Tales”, as chapters.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1.  “The Cottage of Lost Play” — the “framework” story, recounting\n    Eriol's arrival to the place where the following stories are told\n2.  “The Music of the Ainur” — the first version of what would become\n    the Ainulindalë\n3.  “The Coming of the Valar and the Building of Valinor” — later\n    Valaquenta and the first chapters of Quenta Silmarillion\n4.  “The Chaining of Melko”\n5.  “The Coming of the Elves and the Making of Kôr”\n6.  “The Theft of Melko and the Darkening of Valinor”\n7.  “The Flight of the Noldoli”\n8.  “The Tale of the Sun and Moon”\n9.  “The Hiding of Valinor”\n10. “Gilfanon's Tale: The Travail of the Noldoli and the Coming of\n    Mankind” (which contains the first and only reference to the\n    enigmatic “wizard” fay, Tu)\n\n\nComparison with The Silmarillion\n\nThe following is a direct comparison between the contents of the early\nBOOK OF LOST TALES and the later sketches that became THE SILMARILLION.\n\nAlthough one of the _Lost Tales_ often corresponds to more tales from\n_The Silmarillion_, still the narrative in the _Lost Tales_ is more\nextended (typically, 50% pages more).\n\nIn J. R. R. Tolkien's notebooks, the 4th and 5th tales were a single one\ntold by Meril-i-Turinqi, but Christopher Tolkien decided to separate\nthem because of their length. The same applies to the 6th and 7th tales,\ntold by Lindo.\n\n+-----------------------------+---------+-----------------------------+\n| The Book of Lost Tales      | _Storyt | The Silmarillion            |\n|                             | eller_  |                             |\n+=============================+=========+=============================+\n|                             |         |                             |\n+-----------------------------+---------+-----------------------------+\n| Book I                      |\n+-----------------------------+---------+-----------------------------+\n| 1.

They, like the other\nHalf-elven before them, were given the choice of mortality.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe First Age\n\nTwo important marriages in the First Age of Middle-earth resulted in the\nmixing of elvish and mortal Edain blood.\n\nThe first of these was between the mortal Beren of the House of Bëor and\nhalf-elf/half-maia Lúthien, daughter of the elf Thingol, the King of\nDoriath and High King of the Sindar and his Queen Melian the Maia. Beren\ndied in the quest for the Silmaril, and in despair, Lúthien's spirit\ndeparted her body and made its way to the Halls of Mandos. Mandos\nallowed them a unique fate, and they were re-bodied as mortals in\nMiddle-earth, where they dwelt until their deaths.\n\nTheir son Dior was thus one-quarter elvish by blood, although since he\nwas born after their embodiment, the nature of his mortality is quite\nunclear. He died young in any case, when the Sons of Fëanor attacked\nDoriath.\n\nDior's wife was Nimloth, a Sindarin elf, and with her he had three\nchildren: Elwing, Eluréd and Elurín. During the Sack of Menegroth by the\nSons of Fëanor, Elwing escaped to the Mouths of Sirion while Eluréd and\nElurin were seized by servants of Celegorm and abandoned in the forest\nto die. They were never found and were presumed to have perished in the\nforest.\n\nThe second marriage of men and elves in the first age was between Tuor\nof the House of Hador and Idril of the Noldor and Vanyar. Their son\nwas Eärendil. After the fall of Gondolin, Eärendil also escaped to the\nMouths of Sirion, and married Elwing. They had two sons, Elrond\n'Half-elven' and Elros.\n\n\nThe Choice of the Half-elven\n\n\n\nAfter the conclusion of the War of Wrath, Manwë determined that the\nsurviving Half-elven would have their choice of fates: to be counted\namong Elves, and granted eternal life in the Undying Lands; or to be\ncounted among mortals, and granted the ineffable Gift of Men. This\nchoice could be delayed, although not indefinitely.\n\nEärendil would rather have chosen the kindred of Men, but he chose the\nElves for his wife Elwing's sake, who also chose the Elves. Eärendil\nwould thereafter forever sail the heavens in his ship Vingilot, the\nSilmaril of Beren and Lúthien on the prow. In Middle-earth, he was seen\nas the evening star, and the light of his Silmaril was captured in the\nPhial of Galadriel. Elwing built a tower in the Shadowy Seas and often\nmet him on his return.\n\n\n\nElros chose to be counted among mortals, and became Tar-Minyatur, the\nfirst king of Númenor. He finally took his death at the age of five\nhundred years. The heirs of Elros were not given this choice, but their\nlifespan was enhanced many times that of normal Men, and they had the\nfreedom to take death when they willed. In later times the Kings of\nNúmenor, descendants of Elros, regretted their forefather's choice, and\nthis helped lead to the Downfall of Númenor.\n\nElrond chose to be counted among the elves, serving the household of\nGil-galad until the end of the second age, and founding Rivendell in the\nthird. He married the elf Celebrian, daughter of Celeborn and Galadriel,\nand sailed into the west at the conclusion of the War of the Ring.\n\nThe children of Elrond and Celebrian were also given free choice of\nkindred, and therefore Arwen could choose to be counted amongst the\nEdain even though her father had chosen to be counted as Elven. She\nexercised this option, marrying Aragorn II Elessar, king of the Reunited\nKingdom, and finally dying at the age of 2,901 years. Their son Eldarion\nand their daughters were not counted as Half-elven, but rather as\nDúnedain restored.\n\nIt is unclear whether Elladan and Elrohir chose to be of the Edain, or\nthe Eldar; this information is not given in the books. After the books\nwere published, however, Tolkien did have this to say, “The end of his\nsons, Elladan and Elrohir, is not told; they delay their choice, and\nremain for a while”. Letters, #153. “Since most felt that their choice\nwas expressed by whether they would follow their father to Valinor at\nthe time of his own departure, and they were described as remaining in\nRivendell, they are often said to have chosen the Edain”. On the other\nhand, some believe that the twins were allowed to delay their decision\nfor a time.\n\nIt was a tradition in Dol Amroth that Imrazôr the Númenórean had married\nan elf, and therefore the Princes of Dol Amroth were of elven descent.\nLegolas of Mirkwood believed as much upon meeting Prince Imrahil, but\nthe matter remains unclear.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe Elvish form of “Half-elven” is _Peredhil_ (singular _Peredhel_),\nwhich is a Sindarin word.\n\n\nNamed Half-elves\n\n-   Dior Eluchíl, son of Beren and Lúthien and grandson of Melian the\n    Maia\n-   Eärendil, son of Tuor and Idril\n-   Elwing, daughter of Dior and Nimloth, Queen of Doriath\n-   Eluréd and Elurín, the sons of Dior and Nimloth\n-   Elrond, son of Eärendil and Lord of Rivendell\n-   Elros, the son of Eärendil, brother of Elrond, and first King of\n    Númenor\n-   Arwen Undómiel, or ARWEN EVENSTAR, daughter of Elrond and Celebrían,\n    and Queen of the Reunited Kingdom\n-   Elladan and Elrohir, the twin sons of Elrond and Celebrían\n-   Galador, son of Imrazôr and Mithrellas\n\n\nBeyond Tolkien\n\nUnlike in some other fantasy worlds, Tolkien's Half-elves are not a\ndistinct race per se. In _Dungeons & Dragons_ and other fantasy\nrole-playing games, these beings are simply known as half-elves\n(singular half-elf) instead of using other terms. Some other fantasy\nstories call beings who are half-human and half-\n_Halflings_; the term “Halfling” in Tolkien's legendarium pertains only\nto hobbits."

    "text": "The BLUE MOUNTAINS or ERED LUIN, also known as ERED LINDON, was a\nmountain range situated in the far west of Eriador.\n\n\nHistory\n\nEarly Arda\n\nThe Blue Mountains arose sometime after the tumultuous chaos caused by\nMelkor's destruction of the Two Lamps that destroyed the perfect\nsymmetry of Arda. In these early days, the Blue Mountains were located\nbetween the newly formed great sea of Belegaer and the newly formed Sea\nof Helcar. The Blue Mountains were connected to the Iron Mountains to\nthe north and the Red Mountains in the east which formed one great\nmountain range chain known by different names. The Ancient Grey\nMountains were to its south separated by a great gap.\n\nEldar Days\n\nDuring the Years of the Trees and the Sleep of Yavanna, the Blue\nMountains was an unbroken line separating Eriador from Beleriand. Seven\nrivers arose in it on the western side, and the land these rivers flowed\nthrough was known as Ossiriand, which was later also known as Lindon,\ntherefore the mountains were sometimes referred to as the Ered Lindon.\nDwarven kinfolk either awoke here or migrated here from other awakening\npoints and delved the cities of Belegost and Nogrod and made contact and\nalliance with the Sindar of Thingol.\n\nSecond Age\n\nThe mountain range was broken during the war of the Valar against\nMorgoth, and at the middle of the range the sea broke through, creating\na great gap where was set the Gulf of Lune a new terminus for the river\nLune. In the middle of the gap, where the Lune met the sea, the Grey\nHavens of Mithlond of the Elven Kingdom of Lindon were built. When seen\nas the border of Lindon the Ered Luin were called Ered Lindon.\n\n\n\nThird Age and beyond\n\nDuring the Third Age, its forests, besides that of Mirkwood, were the\nlargest in Middle-earth. In the latter part of the Third Age, the\nDwarves settled the Blue Mountains again when Thráin II and his son\nThorin and the Dwarven survivors of the Sack of Erebor moved from\nDunland and delved a prosperous settlement there. After the War of\nthe Ring and the defeat of Sauron, Elves continued to travel west to\nLindon through the gap in the mountains by way of the Gulf of Lune,\nwhere they eventually intended to set sail on the Straight Road to the\nUndying Lands of Aman. After the War of the Ring it is said that many\nDwarves from the east migrated back to their ancient homeland and Ered\nLuin was a prosperous kingdom oncemore.\n\n\nInhabitants\n\nDwarves\n\nThe Blue Mountains, the Iron Hills, and Lonely Mountain were the main\nareas of Dwarf colonization by the late Third Age. During the 4000+\nyears following the cataclysmic sundering and catastrophic downfall of\nBeleriand, when the mighty Dwarf fortress-cities of Nogrod and Belegost\nwere inundated by the sea, it is possible that the Dwarves rebuilt those\ncities to their former splendor.\n\n\n\nThe Dwarves would have plundered the mines of the Blue Mountains for the\nhoard of resources it held within the depths of darkness at its roots. \n\nBefore setting off in their quest to the Lonely Mountain, Thorin\nOakenshield and his twelve other companions (as well as other Dwarves of\nthe Lonely Mountain) resided here in the Blue Mountains after being\nrendered homeless by the Dragon Smaug.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, many Dwarves from the eastern kingdoms\nmigrated back to the Blue Mountains. Their population grew and the Blue\nMountains became a prosperous kingdom once again.\n\nElves\n\nIt is shown in several maps made of Middle-earth that vast ancient\nforests flanked both sides of the Blue Mountains, even after the\ngargantuan slaughter of Eriador's great forests by the men of Númenor\nand their incessant appetite for lumber. These forests, alongside the\nfertile coastal plain, would prove to be hotspots for Elven migration\nand inhabitation.\n\n\n\nIt is stated at the very beginning of _The Hobbit_ that the High Elves\nlived within the vales and forests of the Blue Mountains, presumably\nsharing the land with the Dwarves. To this number would be added Sindar,\nWood-elves, and maybe even a few Avari.\n\nThe influx of new Elven settlers soared after the end of the First Age\nwho lived under the Ñoldor High King Gil-galad in the Second Age.\nAfter the fall of Gil-galad in the Third Age, the foot of the Blue\nMountains became part of Lindon where Elves lived temporarily until they\nleft for the Undying Lands, due to the Elves desiring to escape the woes\nand predicaments of Middle-earth.\n\n\nGeology\n\nAlthough the Blue Mountains were little described (owing to their\nlocation on the fringes of all of Tolkien's tales), we can assume a bit\nof their geology. The outer layers of the mountains seem to have been\nunderlaid by metamorphic rocks formed in contact with numerous igneous\nintrusions. This environment is often necessary to produce veins of ore\nsuch as those mined by the Dwarves from the beginning of time. This\nenvironment produced the trove of Gold, Silver, Iron, Gems, and other\nmaterials that made the Dwarf kingdoms incredibly wealthy.\n\nThe Blue mountains were shorter than the Misty Mountains, and not as\nhigh; their altitude was probably around 3000-4000 meters, on average.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe Sindarin name for the mountains, _ERED LUIN_ is translated as the\nwords _ered_ ('Mountains') and _luin_ ('Blue'). \n\n\nPortrayal in Adaptations\n\nVideo Game\n\n\n\nCentral Ered Luin is amongst the regions fleshed out in _The Lord of the\nRings Online_. Significant areas surrounding Dwarven and Elven\nsettlements are available for exploration and adventuring. The Blue\nMountains are only in the campaign in _The Lord of the Rings: The Battle\nfor Middle-earth II_ but may not in a skirmish."

    "title": "Durin's Folk",
    "page_id": "2707",
    "text": "DURIN'S FOLK (also called the LONGBEARDS) were a clan of Dwarves\n    that originally inhabited Moria in the Misty Mountains, led by Durin\n    I, “The Deathless”. He was succeeded by many generations of kings,\n    among them appeared six others also called Durin. (The Dwarves\n    believed that these six were the reincarnation of Durin I, with\n    memories of their past lives.)\n\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the Second Age, Durin's Folk began a friendship with the Noldor\nof Celebrimbor in Eregion.\n\nIn the middle of the Third Age, they were expelled by the Balrog of\nMoria known as the “Durin's Bane”. In TA 1980 their king Durin VI was\nkilled by the creature that the following year also killed his son Náin\nI. Thráin I, Nain's son, fled along with his people to the Lonely\nMountain where he founded the Kingdom of the Lonely Mountain. During the\nreign of Thorin I son of Thrain was heard rumors greater wealth in the\nGrey Mountains. Thorin decided to leave Erebor and take his people to\nthe north, where they lived in peace until the reign of his grandson\nNain II when they began to be attacked by dragons. During the reign of\nDáin I, one Cold-drake invaded his kingdom and killed him along with his\nsecond child, Frór. Thrór, eldest son of Dain I, and now King of Durin's\nFolk, returned along with his uncle Borin and part of his people to the\nLonely Mountain. His younger brother Grór left for the east where he\nfounded his kingdom in the Iron Hills. Thrór ruled during long years of\npeace until a Fire Drake, Smaug, the last of the great dragons,\ndescended from the north and sacked and took the Lonely Mountain.\nDurin's Folk became a nomadic people in exile. Many of them went to the\nIron Hills and settled there. Thrór went insane, and tried to reclaim\nKhazad-dûm by himself, leading to his death at the hand of Azog.\n\nThis started the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, which ended at the Battle\nof Azanulbizar, where Azog was killed by Dáin Ironfoot, lord of the Iron\nHills. After the battle, many of the Dwarves under the rule of Thrain II\nwent to the west to the Blue Mountains and settled there. After 60 years\nThrain's son, Thorin II, or “Thorin Oakenshield”, was convinced by the\nwizard Gandalf to lead a company of 13 Dwarves and one Hobbit on a quest\nto recover the Lonely Mountain. The quest lead to the death of Smaug at\nthe hand of Bard the Bowman, and the great Battle of Five Armies against\narmies of Orcs, in which Thorin and his nephews Fili and Kili were\nkilled. But Thorin's sacrifice led to the Kingdom of the Lonely Mountain\nbeing restored under the rule of his cousin Dáin II, Lord of the Iron\nHills, who became King under the Mountain in TA 2941. He died in the\nbattle of Dale at the end of the Third Age, fighting hordes of\nEasterlings in Dale. His people were then besieged. After Sauron was\ndefeated, his son Thorin III Stonehelm and Bard II, the new king of\nDale, defeated the Easterlings.\n\nDurin VII, the last to be named “Durin”, later retook Moria and became\nknown as “Durin the Last”.\n\n\nKings of Durin's Folk\n\nHere is a full account of all the Kings of Durin's Line, but the\nfollowing list shows only the names of those Kings who were saved or\nwhose reigns can be studied. As the descendants of Durin I were forced\nby circumstances to travel through Middle-earth, the main sites of their\nmonarchy is shown along with the name of each king.\n\nDurin I, Khazad-dum\n\nDurin the Deathless was the oldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves,\ncreated by Aulë during the First Age of the World. He was called “the\nDeathless” as he lived long before an age far more advanced than any\nother Dwarf, and so was revered as the eldest of their race.\n\nEach of these seven Dwarves' parents founded a house. Durin's House was\nthe Longbeards, and his people were named Durin's Folk.\n\nAccording to the traditions of the Dwarves, he was put to sleep alone\nunder Mount Gundabad in the north of the Misty Mountains, which remained\na sacred site for them. He awoke some time after the awakening of the\nElves in 1050 the Age of the Trees, and according to ancient legends he\ntraveled long distances to find other families of Dwarves, and then\nother Dwarves followed. He came to the Mirrormere, a lake in a valley\nbelow Caradhras in the Misty Mountains, and there founded what would\nbecome the largest and richest of the Mansions of the Dwarves:\nKhazad-dûm, also known as Moria .\n\nIn the published version of the story, Durin died before the end of the\nFirst Age. In an old version of Appendix B (“The Tale of Years”) he\nappears leading the Dwarves of the ruined kingdoms of Beleriand to found\nKhazad-dûm at the beginning of the Second Age, but Tolkien abandoned\nthis idea.\n\nAfter the death of Durin, Khazad-dûm was ruled by generations of his\ndescendants until the Balrog, Durin's Bane appeared. In this long line,\nTolkien writes, “Appearing occasionally was an heir like his ancestor\nwho was called Durin”. More complete versions of the Durin's Folk make\nclear that Durins appeared spaced among many generations.\n\nDurin II, Khazad-dûm\n\nTolkien did not write anything about his reign. There are indications\nthat the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm reached an agreement with the first Men\nof the Vales of Anduin, who provided them food in exchange for weapons\nmade by the Dwarves. Such cooperation has evolved into coordinated\nattacks against the Orcs with the heavy infantry of the Dwarves\ncomplemented by mounted archers of the valleys.\n\nDurin III, Khazad-dûm\n\nRuled around 1600 Second Age. And was the first Dwarf-Lord given one of\nthe Seven Rings, although it was not widely known until the end of the\nThird Age. The Dwarves believe that he received this ring from\nCelembrimbor and not from Sauron, even with this having participated in\nthe forging.\n\nHammond and Scull conclude that Durin III was most likely King of\nKhazad-dûm when the West Gate of Moria was built, thus is the Durin\nwhose name appears on the door that was made when the Dwarves were\nallies of Celebrimbor. This is a reasonable reference but appears to be\nunfounded by some direct evidence from Tolkien's writings.\n\nDurin IV, Khazad-dûm\n\nTolkien did not write anything about his reign. He would have lived in\nKhazad-dûm at the end of the Second Age or the beginning of the Third\nAge.\n\nDurin V, Khazad-dûm (Third Age ? - Third Age ?)\n\nDurin V lived in Khazad-dûm, and with the aid of the Dwarf-ring\nprospered. He was the last of the Durins to have reigned in peace as\nKing of Khazad-dûm without knowledge of the Balrog that slept beneath\nthem.\n\nDurin VI, Khazad-dûm (reigned until TA 1980)\n\nDurin VI was King of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm in the Third Age, when\nDwarves mining in search of mithril in Caradhras' roots awakened the\nBalrog of hiding deep within the earth. The creature killed Durin TA\n1980, and became known as “Durin's Bane”. Durin VI was the first known\nreincarnation of Durin the Deathless to not have a natural death. He was\nsucceeded by his son, Náin I, who was killed by the same Balrog in the\nfollowing year and after this tragic event the ancient city was\nabandoned by its people.\n\nNáin I, son of Durin VI. Khazad-dûm\n\nHe ruled for only one year in Khazad-dûm before being killed by the\nBalrog. He was the last of the Kings of Durin's Line to rule in\nKhazad-dûm, being replaced by his son as King-in-exile.\n\nThráin I, son of Náin I: Erebor. (ruled for 209 years, until TA 2190)\n\nThráin I led a large part of his people away from Khazad-dûm to the\nNortheast of Middle-earth. It was Thráin who founded the great Kingdom\nof the Lonely Mountain in TA 1999, under The Lonely Mountain near the\ncity of Dale and Lake-town on the Long Lake. He was succeeded by his\nson.\n\nThorin I, son of Thrain I. Grey Mountains\n\nHearing of greater riches in the Grey Mountains, he decided to leave\nthe Lonely Mountain with the greater part of his folk, along with the\nDwarven treasure: The Arkenstone, leaving the mountain abandoned for\nover three-hundred years until his descendent Thrór reclaimed it. He was\nsucceeded as king by his son Glóin.\n\nGlóin the son of Thorin I. Grey Mountains (reigned for 96 years until TA 2385)\n\nGlóin continued the reign of his father in the Grey Mountains, and was\nsucceeded by his son.\n\nÓin, son of Gloin. Grey Mountains (He ruled for 103 years until 2488 TA)\n\nDuring his reign, the Dwarves of Durin's Folk still lived in the Grey\nMountains to the north. In the last years of his reign, the Shadow\nreturned to Dol Guldur in Mirkwood and Orcs and other evil creatures\nbegan to multiply in the northern mountains, and in the later years of\nÓin, the orcs invaded Moria, which was abandoned, and took it. This was\nonly the first of the calamities that would fall on the Durin home for\ncenturies to come.\n\nÓin was 250 years old when he died, having reigned for 103 years. He was\nsucceeded by his son, Náin, who became King Náin II.\n\nNáin II, son of Óin. Grey Mountains (reigned for 97 years until 2585 TE)\n\nAt that time, the prosperous Dwarves began to suffer an attack from the\nnorth by dragons, Náin had two sons, the oldest Dáin, and Borin. he was\nsucceeded by his eldest son as was custom.\n\nDáin I, II Náin son. Grey Mountains (reigned for four years until 2589 TE)\n\nDáin I's short reign had a blunt end when he was killed next to his\nsecond child, Fror, by a great Cold-drake at the door of his own\nkingdom. He was succeeded by the eldest of his three sons.\n\nThrór the son of Dáin I. Erebor (He ruled for 201 years until 2790 TE)\n\nHe led his people out of the north, infested with dragons, back to the\nLonely Mountain, while his younger brother, Grór, took a piece of his\npeople further east, to dwell in the Iron Hills. He was King under the\nMountain for more than 180 years, until the great dragon Smaug descended\nupon the kingdom and sacked The Lonely Mountain. He escaped destruction\nwith his son and grandson, and wandered the wilderness. He went mad, and\ntried to single-handedly reclaim the former home of his people,\nKhazad-dûm, which he found infested with Orcs. His death at the hands of\nAzog, leader of the Orcs, was the trigger for the War of the Dwarves and\nOrcs. He was succeeded by his son, Thrain II .\n\nThrain II, son of Thrór, King in Exile. Dunland, later the Blue Mountains (reigned for 60 years until 2850 TA)\n\nThrain II avenged the death of his father by defeating Azog and his army\nof Orcs in Azanulbizar. In the first half of his life, he lived on\nErebor, but later moved to the Blue Mountains west of Eriador. Before\nhis reign ended, he decided to return to Erebor, but while traveling\nthrough the forest, he was captured by evil creatures and died in the\ndungeons of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur. He was succeeded by his son.\n\nThorin II, or Thorin Oakenshield, son of Thrain II. Blue Mountains (reigned for 91 years until 2941 TA)\n\n Thorin II was a ruler of the Blue Mountains for many years but, like\nhis father, was determined to return to his former home in Erebor.\nAccompanied by Gandalf, twelve other Dwarves, and Bilbo Baggins, he\njourneyed far to the East and, against all expectations, recovered the\nLonely Mountain from Smaug. After the death of Smaug, the Battle of Five\nArmies was fought at the feet of Erebor, and Thorin was killed. The only\nliving descendants of Thrór's lineage, his young nephews Fili and Kili,\nhad also perished in battle and so the monarchy was passed to the line\nof Grór, younger brother of Thrór, specifically for Grór's grandson,\nDáin Ironfoot. Although he was not crowned King under the Mountain,\nThorin had claimed the title by law, once he had recovered Erebor.\n\nDáin II, or Dáin Ironfoot, Grór grandson. Erebor (reigned for 78 years until 3019 T. E.)\n\nDáin succeeded his father, Nain, as Lord of the Iron Hills. Became King\nunder the Mountain as well as King of all the Durin's Folk after the\ndeath of his cousin Thorin Oakenshield, the first in Durin's lineage to\ninherit the kingdom without being the father-to-son succession. Reigned\nsuccessfully for many years until the time of the War of the Ring when\nhe was killed in the Battle of Dale, despite his great age valiantly\nfighting the Easterlings who, under Sauron's orders, attacked Erebor and\nDale. After his death the Men and Dwarves were besieged inside Erebor.\nHe was succeeded by his son.\n\nThorin III, or Thorin Stonehelm. Erebor\n\nThorin III took the lead of his people after the death of his father. He\nendured a brief siege of seven days in Erebor, when news of the defeat\nof Sauron reached the Easterlings, he and the Men of Dale led by Bard II\ncharged out of the mountain and routed the Easterlings. He helped\nrebuild the Lonely Mountain and Dale, and prospered. His realm became a\nclose ally of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor of King Elessar.\nThorin III had an heir, who was held to be the reincarnation of Durin\nthe Deathless, and who succeeded him at his death as Durin VII the Last.\n\nDurin VII\n\nDurin VII, or “the Last”, was a direct descendant of King Thorin\nStonehelm (and according to some sources, was his son), ruler of Erebor\nand the Iron Hills in the Fourth Age. His birth was apparently\nprophesied at the rise of Dáin II after the Battle of Five Armies. He\nled the Dwarves of Durin's Folk in the recolonization of Khazad-dum some\ntime after the beginning of the Fourth Age, and there they remained\n“Until the world grew old and the days of Durin's race came to an end.”\n\nDurin I died before the end of the First Age, then between his reign and\nThorin III, Kings of Durin's Line ruled for a period of about 6,500\nyears. Assuming that the average time of a reign of a King of Durin's\nFolk was approximately a century, it can be deduced that there have been\nabout fifty names of Kings that are not on this list.\n\n\nTranslation around the World\n\nde:Durins Volkit:Popolo di Durinpl:Plemię Durinaru:Род Дурина\n\n  Foreign Language      Translated name\n  --------------------- --------------------\n  Chinese (Hong Kong)   都靈子嗣\n  Czech                 Durinův lid\n  French                Le Peuple de Durin\n  German                Durins Volk\n  Italian               Popolo di Durin\n  Polish                Plemię Durina\n  Portuguese (Brasil)   Povo de Durin\n  Russian               Род Дурина\n  Spanish               Pueblo de Durin\n  Welsh                 Gwerin Durin yn"

    "text": "The '''Barrow-wights '''were shape-shifting beings of darkness, similar\nin circumstance to Wraiths, who dwelt in dark places of Eriador such as\nthe Barrow-downs.\n\nThe characteristic of shape-shifter gave Barrow-wights the ability to\nreanimate whatever life-form they wished. The ones which attacked the\nfour Hobbits reanimated the corpses of the Kings of the Barrows. Most\noften the Barrow-wight came on the unwary traveller in the guise of a\ndark phantom whose eyes were luminous and cold. The voice of the figure\nwas at once horrible and hypnotic; its skeletal hand had a touch like\nice and a grip like the iron jaws of a trap. Once under the spell, the\nvictim had no will of his own. In this way the Barrow-wights drew the\nliving into the tombs of the downs. A dismal choir of tortured souls\ncould be heard inside the Barrow as, in the green half-light, the\nBarrow-wight laid his victim on a stone altar and bound him in chains of\ngold. He draped him in pale cloth and precious jewelry of the ancient\ndead, and with a sacrificial sword ended them.\n\n\n\nEast of the Brandywine River beyond the Old Forest were the\nBarrow-downs, the most ancient burial ground of men in Middle-earth.\nThere were no trees nor water there, but only grass and turf covering\ndome-shaped hills that were crowned with monoliths and great rings of\nbone-white stone. These hills were the burial mounds that were made in\nthe First Age of the Sun for the Kings of Men. For many ages the\nBarrow-downs were sacred and revered, until out of the Kingdom of Angmar\nmany terrible and tortured spirits fled across Middle-earth, desperately\nsearching to hide from the ravening light of the Sun. Demons whose\nbodies had been destroyed looked for other bodies in which their evil\nspirits could dwell. And so it was that the Barrow-downs became a\nhaunted and terrible place. The demons became Barrow-wights, the Undead\nwho animated the bones and jeweled armor of the ancient Kings of Men who\nhad lived in the First Age of the Sun.\n\n\n\nIn the darkness they were powerful spirits and they could be held at bay\nonly with the spell of strong incantations, such as Tom Bombadil's song.\nHowever, normally they could be destroyed only by exposure to light, the\nentity they hated and feared the most. The Barrow-wights were lost and\ntortured spirits, and their last chance to remain upon Earth depended on\nthe dark security of burial vaults. Once the stone chamber was broken\nopen, light would pour in on the Barrow-wights and they would fade like\nmist before the sun and be gone forever.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Barrow-wights began appearing in the Barrow-downs after the Dúnedain\nof Cardolan succumbed to the ravages of the Great Plague. They were put\nthere by sorcerers of Angmar who corrupted the souls of the inhabitants\nof the Barrow-downs. The sorcerers were sent by the Witch-king of Angmar\nwho wished to keep the Dúnedain away from there.\n\nOn September 28 of 3018 Frodo Baggins and his companions, Sam Gamgee,\nMerry, and Pippin while passing through the Barrow-downs were captured\none by one by the Barrow-wights, and trapped in what was believed to be\nthe cairn of the last prince of Cardolan.\n\nThere they were almost slain by a wight; three of the Hobbits had been\nlain in a barrow filled with a strange green light and were dressed in\nwhite robes and wore jewels and gold and had a sword across their necks.\nThe wight had finished an incantation, and was preparing to finish them\noff when Frodo summoned up the courage to slice off its hand; he then\ncalled upon Tom Bombadil when the wight extinguished the dim light in\nthe cavern. Bombadil performed some kind of exorcism on the barrow,\nthrough the rare power of his singing, which caused the wight to flee\nwith a shriek; he then gave the hobbits swords and then spread out the\ngold and treasures from the barrow on the grass, so that the barrow's\nspell was broken and no Wight could make habitat there.\n\n\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\n-   It is possible that the Witch-king himself had visited the\n    Barrow-downs during the Ringwraiths' search for Frodo, and that it\n    was he who had roused the Barrow-wights to be on the watch for\n    trespassers on their land.\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nDue to his inspiration from _Hrómundar saga Gripssonar_, during the\nwriting of _The Lord of the Rings_ Tolkien at first foresaw a link\nbetween the Wights and the Ringwraiths, initially describing the Black\nRiders as “horsed Wights”, but the suggestion that they were the same\nkind of creatures was dropped in the published work. In the final work\nthere remained a link between them: the wights were now spirits sent by\nthe Witch-king.\n\nInspiration\n\nThe concept of a burial mound housing evil spirits was not a new one\ncreated by Tolkien. The Barrow-wights themselves are based on a similar\ncreature in Germanic Mythology known in Norse as Draugar (the singular\nbeing _Draugr_).\n\nThey were said to be evil spirits residing in the bodies of dead heroes\nand kings and usually (but not universally) unharmed by conventional\nweapons. In such cases a hero of great strength and bravery. The defeat\nof a Draugr was not always permanent; they could return to plague the\nliving if certain actions were not performed after the Draugr was\nvanquished. The usual means of destroying a Draugr was to cut off its\nhead and to burn the body, for only then would the evil spirit be\nprevented from returning to the body.\n\nAnother, probably related, creature from Germanic and Slavic folklore\nwas the Mahr (also called an Alp), a Vampire-like creature that was said\nto rise from its barrow after dark to plague the sleeping and drink\ntheir blood. The primary way to vanquish them was to open their Barrow\nto the rays of the Sun, much like the Barrow-wight from Tolkien's\nmythology.\n\nA very similar creature in Japanese mythology is the _onryo,_ as they\nare undead spirits which dwell in darkness and are seemingly affected by\nthe Sun. The _onryo_ of Japan are deceased women, and have returned to\nEarth in a desire for vengeance. These spirits can also possess the\nliving, the dead, and the undead.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe term _Barrow-wights_ was based on the Old Norse “Draugr”. _Barrow_\nrefers to the burial mounds they inhabited and _wight_ is the modern\nderivation of _wiht,_ an Old English word for “living being” or\n“creature” (it does not mean “spirit” or “ghost”; it is cognate to\nmodern German “Wicht”, meaning “unpleasant person”). Tolkien borrowed\nthis concept from Norse mythology, see e.g. _Waking of Angantyr_ and\n_Hrómundar saga Gripssonar_.\n\n\nAppearances and Notable wights\n\n\n\n-   The Hobbit: The Video Game (Sierra) - “Wight Lord” (Spiders & Flies\n    Level Boss)\n-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring_ _Video Game_\n-   _The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring_\n-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II_\n-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II, The Rise of\n    the Witch-King_\n    -   Karsh, a fictional Wraith-hero from Cardolan who therefore has\n        the appearance of a Wight\n-   _The Lord of the Rings Online_\n    -   Sambrog, a fictional Wight-boss\n-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring_\n-   _LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game_ (Downloadable\n    character)\n-   _LEGO The Hobbit: The Video Game_ (Downloadable character)"

    "text": "The DISASTER OF THE GLADDEN FIELDS or the BATTLE OF THE GLADDEN FIELDS\nwas a battle at the beginning of the Third Age, in which Isildur and a\nretinue of the Dúnedain of Arnor, marching home after the defeat of\nSauron, were attacked by a large group of Orcs from the Misty Mountains.\nThe king and his three eldest sons -- Elendur, Aratan, and Ciryon --\nwere slain and the Ring of Power was lost in the River Anduin. Only\nthree men survived the encounter, but the shards of Narsil were saved by\nOhtar, an esquire of the king. \n\nThe repercussions of the attack were wide-ranging, as Isildur had been\nking of both Gondor and Arnor, and his death left the two kingdoms to\nseparate into isolated realms. Arnor wouldn't be able to completely\nrecover from this catastrophic loss of a considerable part of its nobles\nand knights until the kingship of Aragorn II Elessar of the Elendili in\nthe Fourth Age. However, most importantly, Isildur's death prevented him\nfrom passing on the One Ring to the Keepers of the Three, which he had\ndivulged to his son Elendur to be his chief reason for visiting Elrond\nin Rivendell.\n\n\nHistory\n\nPrelude\n\nAfter that War of the Alliance, Isildur remained in Gondor for a year,\nregaining lost territories, and reorganising the realm. He sent the\ngreater part of the armies of Arnor back to Eriador via the Númenórean\nroad from the Fords of Isen to Fornost. After he was done with arranging\nthe affairs of the southern realm, he delivered the South Kingdom to\nMeneldil and forthwith designed to march to Rivendell. He had left his\nwife and youngest son there, yet he also greatly desired the counsel of\nElrond at that time. It was for this reason that he proceeded from\nOsgiliath into the Vale of the Anduin, and over the Cirith Forn en\nAndrath, which was the high-climbing pass of the Northern Misty\nMountains which led down into the valley of Rivendell. \n\nThe Battle\n\nThe Dúnedain host had traveled northwards from Lórien, marching along a\npath that led to Greenwood the Great wherein Thranduil was king. Their\nroute had been diverted by the flooding of the Anduin, which had\ncompelled Isildur to take the road on the sheer slopes on the eastern\nbanks of the river. King Isildur's party was flanked on its left by\nsteep cliffs overlooking the River Anduin, and to its left, by hills and\na forest.\n\nThe Dúnedain were singing marching songs and generally of good cheer as\ndusk drew close, at which time the lusty men heard the strain of orcs in\nthe forest hills. Isildur organised his retinue into a “Thangail,” a\nshield-wall two men deep and flexible at the flanks; it could be made to\nback up completely so as to form a defensive ring should the unit be\nsurrounded. The Dúnedain could only guess at the strength of the enemy,\nbut they perceived that the orc host was many times, perhaps even 10\ntimes as large as their own. Isildur expressed regret that the orcs\nshould have approached them at such uneven ground, for had it been level\nor rather downhill for the Dúnedain, then they should have formed up\ninto a “Dírnaith”, a wedge formation that could have shattered the\nmiscreant orcs. \n\nThe first orc onslaught came quickly, striking at the center of the\nDúnedain line after a volley of arrows had been fired. At this point,\nIsildur sent for his esquire, Ohtar, to take the shards of Narsil to\nRivendell for safekeeping should the battle go ill. The orcs were\ndiscomfited at no cost among the Dúnedain, all of whom towered above the\ntallest of the orcs. Piles of orcs had gathered before the Dúnedain, and\nthe orcs again kept their distance out of range of the powerful\nNúmenórean bows. Isildur judged that the orcs, in their typically craven\nfashion, were so thoroughly dismayed to be stung so badly in the fight\nthat they would not resume battle, but would rather stalk the Dúnedain\nfrom a distance. The king then resolved to bring his retinue onto lower\nand more level ground, yet the host had not marched more than a mile\nbefore the orcs returned again. Hope faded as the orcs crept towards\nthem in silence and under cover of darkness. In this second attack, the\norcs approached in a full crescent, resolving to pressure the Dúnedain\nat all points in their formation. Men were slain, and the formation\nstarted crumbling. Yet the Men of Númenór did their sires honour, for\nmany died at the cost of five orcs each. Ciryon and Aratan were killed,\nand Elendur convinced Isildur to flee and cross the Anduin if he could,\non whose other side he might find safety and make his way to Rivendell. \n\nThe Route of Isildur\n\nIsildur then cloaked himself with the ring, and sped down into the\nvalley. He made a long journey to the banks of the Anduin, and there\nparted with all of his arms and armour save for a short sword. The river\nwas hard to cross, thus, though rarely equaled in strength and vigour\neven by fellow Dúnedain, Isildur was exhausted when he reached the\nwestern shallows. There, reeds and rushes tangled him and the ring\nabandoned him, slipping from his fingers. Orc prowlers then caught sight\nof the large and imposing figure, and out of fear they shot at him and\nfled quickly, having pierced him in throat and heart. \n\nAftermath\n\nOnly Ohtar, and an unnamed companion; and a stunned combatant and\nesquire of Elendur, Estelmo, had survived the disaster. Isildur's body\nwas never recovered by men, and was secretly presumed captured and\nmutilated at Sauron's command. The orc host which had waylaid the\nDúnedain were quickly scattered by a relief force of woodsmen which\nnone-the-less had come too late to affect the fate of the king's\nretinue. The orc victory had been so Pyrrhic that it would take them\nmany years before they would gather the strength to venture out again in\nthe Vales of Anduin. Estelmo was recovered alive, but stunned from a\nclub's blow, and he told of how Isildur and Elendur had related to each\nother about the One Ring before their deaths. Isildur remarked: “I\ncannot use it. I dread the pain of touching it. And I have not yet found\nthe strength to bend it to my will. It needs one greater than I know\nmyself to be. My pride has fallen. It should go to the Keepers of the\nThree.”\n\nThen, probably the biggest consequences of the Gladden Fields was that\nthe union of Arnor and Gondor was broken by blood, but more importantly;\nthat Isildur never managed to give the Ring of Power to Elrond,\nGaladriel and Celeborn. All of them would have most likely decided to\ndestroy it long before Sauron could have gathered his spirit again and\nrefortified Mordor; in effect destroying the Dark Lord in the same way\nhe was extinguished beyond all hope of recovery by Frodo."

    "text": "MENEGROTH, also known as the THOUSAND CAVES and THE CAVES OF MENEGROTH,\nwas the capital city of the land of Doriath, which was home\nto King Thingol and Queen Melian of the Sindarin people during the First\nAge of the Sun.\n\nWithin it was the beautifully decorated Hall of Thingol where sat his\nthrone and where he dispensed his judgments. It was there that Thingol\nwas slain by the Dwarven craftsmen of Nogrod. The quest of Beren to gain\na Silmaril begins at Menegroth. It is also here that Lúthien the fair\nwas born. It was later sacked by the Sons of Fëanor in pursuit of one of\nthe Silmarils taken from Morgoth's Iron Crown prior to the War of Wrath.\n\n\nHistory\n\nYears of the Trees\n\n\n\nIn the years after the War for Sake of the Elves, the Teleri were\nscattered all over Beleriand in havens such as Falas or in the woodlands\nat Region and Neldoreth. Their leader Elwë disappeared for a long time\nin the woods with Melian, his beloved. Then, he and Melian reappeared\ncalling himself Thingol, was urged to build a home for his people, so he\nhad the Dwarves of Belegost to aid in the construction of a new\nfortress. It was dug into the western wall of the ravine above the river\nEsgalduin and had only one entrance high above the river accessible by a\nlarge stone bridge. It was named Menegroth or the Thousand Caves because\nof the extensive number of caverns and chambers within all hewn of stone\nand beautifully decorated with carvings of beech trees and birds. These\nwere many different places including armories, treasures, smithies, and\nliving quarters for both the Elves and Dwarves.\n\nDuring the Years of the Trees, Doriath received peace for a long while\nas Thingol preferred isolation and ordered his people not to mingle in\nthe affairs of the Noldor due to the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and the\nQuenyan language was forbidden in his realm. Only with his kin in\nNargothrond did Thingol remain in contact with. He did not take part in\nany of the later Battles of Beleriand relating to the struggle with\nMorgoth.\n\nSometime during mid First Age, Beren Erchamion asked Thingol's\ndaughter, Lúthien, for her hand in marriage, but the King demanded that\nBeren was to go on a quest to retrieve a Silmaril from Morgoth's Iron\nCrown. Lúthien accompanied him on the quest to Angband and they\nsucceeded in eventually retrieving the jewel; but the stakes were high.\nCarcharoth, a wolf guarding the Gates of Angband, bit off Beren's hand\nin which he was holding the Silmaril. The wolf ventured to Menegroth,\nravaging the lands in his path, and broke through its boundaries. He was\nconfronted by the brave Huan, the Great Hound of Valinor, on the\nnorth-east banks of Esgalduin and was killed in the brawl. The Silmaril\nwas found in the wolf's stomach, after swallowing it in Beren's hand,\nand was given to King Thingol.\n\nSack of Doriath\n\nYears later, Hurin Thalion brought the famed Nauglamir as a gift to\nThingol. Thingol contemplated a plan to set the Silmaril into the\nNauglamir. He offered a reward to the Dwarven craftsmen of Nogrod if\nthey succeeded in setting the stone into the Nauglamir. A great desire\nfor the Silmaril possessed the Dwarves and they formed a greed to own\nboth the jewel and the Nauglamir. They finished the work and\nsubsequently claimed the treasure for themselves, slew Thingol, and fled\nMenegroth. \n\nThe news spread fast and the Dwarves were hunted for and then slain. Two\nescaped and and told a tale of lies about their ''betrayal ''and their\nbrethren being _slaughtered_ by the Elves._ _The Dwarves of Nogrod\nformed a great army and rose in anger at the elves and invaded the now\nunguarded Doriath._ _This led to the Battle of the Thousand Caves_ _in\nwhich many were slain on both sides. Mablung, the leader of the guard,\nwas slaughtered at the doors of the treasure chamber where the Nauglamir\nwas held. The Dwarves of Nogrod were then waylaid at Sarn Athrad on\ntheir return by the Laiquendi led by Beren. Their King was slain by\nBeren in single combat and the remainder of their host were felled by\nEnts.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_MENEGROTH_ is a Sindarin word.\n\n\nLay of Leithian\n\n ...through corridors of carven dread whose turns were lit by lanterns\nhung or flames from torches that were flung on dragons hewn in the cold\nstone with jewelled eyes and teeth of bone. Then sudden, deep beneath\nthe earth the silences with silver mirth were shaken and the rocks were\nringing, the birds of Melian were singing; and wide the ways of shadows\nspread as into arched halls she led Beren in wonder. There a light like\nday immortal and like night of stars unclouded, shone and gleamed. A\nvault of topless trees it seemed, whose trunks of carven stone there\nstood like towers of an enchanted wood in magic fast for ever bound,\nbearing a roof whose branches wound in endless tracery of green lit by\nsome leaf-imprisoned sheen of moon and sun, and wrought of gems, and\neach leaf hung on golden stems. Lo! there amid immortal flowers the\nnightingales in shining bowers sang o'er the head of Melian, while water\nfor ever dripped and ran from fountains in the rocky floor. There\nThingol sat. His crown he wore of green and silver, and round his chair\na host in gleaming armour fair...\n\n    ―_Lay of Leithian, lines 981-1011_"

    "text": "The NORTHMEN, also known as the FREE MEN OF THE NORTH,''' '''were Men\nthat lived in the north of Rhovanion in Middle-earth, and were friendly\nto Gondor.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nThe Northmen who dwelt in the Greenwood and other parts of Rhovanion\nwere friendly to the Dúnedain and were, after the Dúnedain, some of the\nmost noble Men in Arda. They were known as Middle Men by the Dúnedain,\nand were believed to have been descended from the same group of Men as\nthe Edain, the Atanatári. The only difference was that they didn't cross\nthe Blue Mountains into Beleriand, and therefore did not journey to\nNúmenor. The result of them not participating in the War against Morgoth\nwas their considerably shorter lifespan; the lifespan of the Dúnedain\nbeing lengthened by the Valar after the War of Wrath. They were\nimportant allies of Gondor and served as a buffer against the\nEasterlings and other foes. For a time many of them even became subjects\nof Gondor, as the realm extended beyond the river Anduin.\n\nEast of Greenwood the Great was the kingdom of Rhovanion, and this\nbecame the most important nation of the Northmen. In the fourteenth\ncentury of the Third Age, King Rómendacil II of Gondor sent his son\nValacar as an ambassador to Vidugavia, the so-called “King of\nRhovanion”. Valacar loved Rhovanion and the daughter of the King,\nVidumavi. He married her and she bore him a son whom she called\n_Vinitharya_ in her mother tongue. In Gondor, Vinitharya became known as\nKing Eldacar and caused a civil war- the Kin-strife- because of his\nmixed Dúnedain/Northmen blood.\n\nShortly after the death of Vidugavia, a small group of Northmen moved to\nthe vales of the Anduin between the Gladden Fields and the Mirkwood,\nprobably to flee from the Wainriders, who had enslaved much of the\npeople of Rhovanion. After the evil Kingdom of Angmar was defeated by\nGondor and the remains of Arnor in TA 1977, these Northmen moved north\nand began to call themselves the Éothéod. They were skilled horse\nbreeders and horsemen. In TA 2510 they responded to a plea of help from\nthe trapped Gondor army at the Field of Celebrant. After they helped\nGondor win this important victory, they were rewarded the province of\nCalenardhon and became known as the Rohirrim. The Men of Rohan who\nfought on foot were called 'Yeomen'.\n\nThe Men of Dale and Lake-town were also counted under the Northmen, as\nwere the woodsmen of Mirkwood. Most of Rhovanion had been depopulated\nafter the wars of the Easterlings and the Great Plague. Their range was\nextremely wide; the Men of the North ranged to the western eaves of\nMirkwood to the southern slopes of the Grey Mountains and from the Long\nLake to Dorwinion on the Sea of Rhun.\n\nIn ''the Hobbit, ''these men carved out a potentially precarious living\nin the eaves of Mirkwood, living as hunters, loggers, trappers, and\nfishermen on the Anduin and its tributaries. They also lived in constant\nfear of attack from Dol Guldur.\n\n\nMilitary\n\nThe larger, more established kingdoms of the North (such as Dale and\nLaketown) would have at least some semblance of a regular standing army.\nThese would have mostly consisted of a force of dismounted men-at-arms,\narmed with a sword and a wooden shield. The Men of the North might have\nreceived some help from Gondor in metalworking, along with their Dwarven\nallies nearby. A militia or town guard would have also been used\nextensively, for the majority of the humans in the north were farmers\nand thus needed their full attention kept on the all-important harvest.\n\nFurther up the military hierarchy would be a force of axemen, for many\nof the woodcutters and loggers in Mirkwood would have learned to use the\naxe from adolescence.\n\nA force of mounted knights and light cavalry would probably have been\navailable for scouting and other duties, for the terrain from Dale to\nDorwinion is mostly flat and featureless, except for a few trees,\nshrubs, and ponds scattered randomly.\n\nBy contrast, the rural, less established kingdom of Rohan trains almost\nevery legitimate soldier it has to fight from horseback, while the\ninfantry division is left to be composed of not soldiers but, as Gamling\nstates in The Two Towers, “every villager able to wield a sword”.\n\n\nLanguages\n\nBeing human means that the Northmen spoke the Common Speech. However,\nthey also have native languages. For example, the Rohirrim spoke\nRohirric, for which Tolkien appears to have been inspired by Old\nEnglish, seeing names like “Éowyn” and “Thengel”. Whereas the Bardings\nand Wood-men speak a similar language to the men of Rohan in terms of\ngross language group, as seen in Old Norse names (akin to Old English\nand Norse being in the same language group), i.e. the name “Brand”\ntranslating to “torch”. The language was not similar to Dwarvish; rather\nthe Dwarf names appearing in _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_\nare Dwarf names given in the language of the Men of Dale, not the native\nDwarf language.  They never shared languages with the Elves or with\ntheir Western, Southern, and Eastern counterparts; other than Westron.\n\nde:Nordmenschen it:Uomini del Nord ru:Северяне"

    "text": "_THE RETURN OF THE KING_ (subtitled _A STORY OF THE HOBBITS_) is an\nanimated adaptation of the novel by J. R. R. Tolkien that was released\nby Rankin/Bass as a TV special in 1980. It has since been released on\nVHS and DVD.\n\nThe film was created by the same team that had worked on the 1977\nanimated version of _The Hobbit_.\n\n\nPlot\n\nThe film begins with Bilbo Baggins celebrating his 129th birthday in\nRivendell. When he notices that Frodo is missing a finger, he asks for\nan explanation. Gandalf introduces the Minstrel of Gondor to recall the\nstory of the One Ring, going all the way back to when Bilbo found it in\nGollum's cave many decades prior.\n\nA flashback begins with the Ring sitting in Bag End. As the years pass,\nits power grows stronger and stronger. Gandalf takes notice of this and\ntells Frodo that the Ring must be taken in Mordor and destroyed in\n“fires where it was wrought”. Should Frodo fail, all of Middle-earth\nwill be ended by the Ring's maker, Sauron. Frodo and his companion,\nSamwise, depart the Shire for Mordor. After many daring adventures, they\nreach Mordor's borders, only for Frodo to be captured and imprisoned in\nCirith Ungol.\n\nSam, after trying and failing to infiltrate the tower, takes it upon\nhimself to be Ring-bearer in Frodo's absence and heads for Mount Doom.\nBut he is stopped when he feels the Ring's weight growing on him and a\nstrong temptation to claim it for himself almost overcomes him. He stops\nhimself when he realizes that he already has everything he could ever\nwant back home. Realizing that he is not fit for the task, he makes his\nway back to Cirith Ungol to rescue Frodo. After successfully\ninfiltrating the tower and fighting his way to Frodo, Sam returns the\nRing to him and, disguised as Orcs, they manage to escape just as the\ntower collapses.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Gondorian capital of Minas Tirith, Gandalf and Pippin\nbear witness as the forces of Mordor prepare to attack the city. They\nturn to Denethor II for help, trying to reassure him that, thanks to the\nRed Arrow, King Théoden and the army of Rohan are on their way. But they\nare dismayed to discover that the Steward has gone mad, referring to\nvision seen through a palantír of the West burning. He orders his own\ndemise, leaving Gandalf and Pippin to face the invasion, with Gandalf\nbeginning to lose hope.\n\nIn Mordor, Frodo and Sam press their way on, with Frodo becoming weaker\nand weaker as they progress. At one point, they are mistaken for Orcs\nand are forced to join a legion heading back to Cirith Ungol. When a\nlegion of Easterlings prevents the Orcs from going any further, Sam\nbegins a riot between the two armies, allowing him and Frodo to escape.\nOnce they are out of sight, they find a cave and spend the night there.\n\nAfter days of searching, Frodo and Sam arrive at Mount Doom, only to\nfind Gollum waiting for them. He attacks the two, trying to seize back\nhis “Precious”. Sam holds him off, allowing Frodo to make for the Cracks\nof Doom. When Sam follows, he finds Frodo reluctant to finish the task.\nThe power of the Ring overtakes him and he claims it, as Sam is forced\nto watch in horror.\n\nThéoden's forces arrive at Pelennor Fields just as the gates to Minas\nTirith are broken down. But the tides turn when the Witch-king of Angmar\nattacks and kills Rohan's king. Coming to avenge her uncle, Éowyn sheds\nher soldier disguise and, with Merry's help, slays the Witch-king. At\nthe same time the battle is won, Aragorn, the heir to the throne of\nGondor, arrives and plans an attack on Mordor. When they arrive at the\nBlack Gate, the Mouth of Sauron mockingly advises that they turn back.\nAragorn stands his ground, refusing to back down.\n\nAt the same time, Sam searches for Frodo in Mount Doom and finds Gollum\nfighting with him for the Ring. Gollum bites off Frodo's finger and\nreclaims the Ring. As he dances with joy, he loses his footing and falls\ninto the magma chamber, simultaneously killing himself and destroying\nthe Ring. Sauron is finally vanquished. As Mount Doom begins to\ncollapse, Frodo and Sam attempt to escape and are almost killed by the\nflowing lava when they are rescued by the Eagles. They are taken to\nMinas Tirith, where they witness Aragorn's coronation.\n\nAs the Minstrel ends the tale, Frodo agrees to come with Bilbo, Elrond,\nand Gandalf as they prepare to set sail into the west and to the Undying\nLands, leaving Middle-earth forever. He passes on the Red Book of\nWestmarch to Sam, saying that he will finish it with stories of his\npeaceful life in the Shire. Gandalf reassures Sam that someday, his kind\nwill have human descendants and when they hear the tale of the Ring,\nthey will wonder: “Is there hobbit in me? Is there?”\n\nAt the Grey Havens, Sam, Merry, and Pippin watch from afar as a ship\nwith Frodo, Elrond, Gandalf, and Bilbo on board disappears into the\nwest.\n\n\nProduction\n\nOrson Bean returned as the voice of the older Bilbo Baggins, as well as\nthat of the story's hero, Frodo Baggins. John Huston was back as well,\nas the beloved wizard Gandalf, and co-starring with them were: William\nConrad as Denethor, Roddy McDowall as Samwise Gamgee, Theodore Bikel as\nAragorn the King himself, and reprising his darkly spoken role of Gollum\nwas the grumpily dangerous Brother Theodore. Rankin/Bass stalwart Paul\nFrees replaced Cyril Ritchard (who had died not long after completing\nhis voice work on _The Hobbit_) as the voice of Elrond; Casey Kasem,\nbest known for his role as Shaggy in Hanna-Barbera's Scooby-Doo, was\nMerry with Sonny Melendrez as Pippin; Nellie Bellflower as Eowyn; and\nGlenn Yarborough returned as principal vocalist, billed here as simply\n“the Minstrel of Gondor”.\n\nVoices\n\n-   Orson Bean - Frodo, Bilbo\n-   Theodore Bikel - Aragorn\n-   William Conrad - Denethor\n-   John Huston - Gandalf\n-   Roddy McDowall - Sam\n-   Theodore - Gollum\n-   Paul Frees - Elrond, Orc, Uruk-hai\n-   Don Messick - Theoden, Easterlings, The Mouth of Sauron\n-   John Stephenson - The Lord of the Nazgul, Gondorian Guard\n-   Casey Kasem - Merry\n-   Sonny Melendrez - Pippin\n-   Nellie Bellflower - Eowyn\n-   Glenn Yarbrough - The Minstrel of Gondor\n\n\n\nReception\n\nReception for the animated TV special is varied. Some commentators view\nit affectionately as an adaptation which children and parents can enjoy\ntogether 1. However, others regard it with disdain, comparing it\nunfavorably to Ralph Bakshi's earlier animated film and Peter Jackson's\nlater live-action film 2, 3. Glenn Yarborough's songs are widely\nderided, although some admit to a campy affection for the surprisingly\ntuneful Orc marching song “Where There's a Whip, There's a Way” or the\nballad “Frodo of the Nine Fingers” 4.\n\nThe film currently garners as 67% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes\n\nMarketing\n\nIn the absence of an official sequel to Ralph Bakshi's _The Lord of the\nRings_, _The Return of the King_ has come to be marketed by Warner Bros.\nas the final part of a loose animated Tolkien trilogy, preceded by _The\nHobbit_ (to which Rankin/Bass originally presented _The Return of the\nKing_ as a direct sequel). The middle film is very different in tone and\ncharacter design, however, and the final two films do not join up\nseamlessly, as both omit various segments from The Two Towers, most\nnotably regarding the events in Shelob's lair and the Ents' march on\nIsengard. Other omissions in the Rankin/Bass version include the\ncharacters of Legolas, Gimli, Arwen, Saruman, Éomer, and Faramir (though\nit's possible the latter makes a brief appearance; there is an\nunidentified Man - who has no lines of dialogue - who accompanies Éowyn\non horseback during Aragorn's coronation, and the two of them exchange\nrather knowing looks). Even Aragorn doesn't have much dialogue or\nscreentime despite being the 'King' of the movie's title.\n\nThe animated _Return of the King_ is available on DVD from Warner Bros.,\nboth individually and as a “boxed trilogy” with the Rankin/Bass _Hobbit_\nand Bakshi's _Lord of the Rings_."

    "title": "The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game",
    "page_id": "2871",
    "text": "The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game (a.k.a. “LOTR TCG” or “LOTR”) is\na collectible card game produced by Decipher, Inc. Released November in\n2001, it is based on Peter Jackson's _Lord of the Rings_ movie trilogy\nand J.R.R. Tolkien's novels. In addition to images taken from the films,\nin 2004 WETA Workshop produced artwork depicting characters and items\nfrom the novel absent from the films, for use on these decipher cards.\n\nIn 2002, the game won the Origins Awards for _Best Trading Card Game of\n2001_ and _Best Graphic Presentation of a Card Game 2001_.\n\n\nGame concept\n\nIt is a game for two or more players, each of whom uses their own deck\nconsisting of equal numbers of _Free Peoples_ and _Shadow_ cards. On a\nplayer's turn they are considered to be the Free Peoples player and\ntheir Fellowship is _active_. He uses his Free Peoples cards to attempt\nto traverse the site-path and destroy the One Ring. Each of his or her\nopponents, the Shadow Players, uses their Shadow cards to prevent this\nby killing or corrupting the ring-bearer, or forcing the Fellowship to\nslow down. At the end of each turn, the position of Free Peoples player\nrotates to the next player in turn. The game is won by the first Free\nPeoples player to survive to the ninth, and final, site or the last\nplayer whose Fellowship is left alive.\n\nAn innovative mechanic called the _twilight pool_ is used as a costing\nmechanism for cards. Each card has a numerical cost (which can be zero).\nWhen the Free Peoples player plays a card, tokens are added to the\ntwilight pool equal to the cost of that card. The Shadow players,\nhowever, must remove twilight tokens equal to their cost to play their\ncards. Thus the larger more powerful the Fellowship the Free Peoples\nplayer plays, the greater the threat from the Shadow players.\n\nThroughout a game, a player will play _companions_ (or Free People\ncharacters) to help defend the ring-bearer. When it is his turn to play\nas the Shadow player, he then can play _minions_ (or Shadow characters)\nto attack the opponents’ companions. The Free People's player (the\ndefender) has the opportunity to choose which of his companions to bring\n\n\nDeck strategies\n\nAs the game expanded; several basic deck strategies were identified and\ndeveloped. As decks are separated into Shadow and Free People sides, the\ntwo sides are to some extent interchangeable.\n\nFor Free Peoples side, _Tank_ decks try to play as much as possible and\nbuild up as many companions to combat the opponents Shadow side with\nforce. _Choke_ decks, the opposite of tank decks, try to put out as\nlittle twilight as possible, denying the opponent resources. _Archery_\ndecks try to use “archery fire” to destroy the minions (Shadow\ncharacters) before they even have a chance to attack.\n\n_Beat down_ decks focus on making one or two minions very powerful, with\nthe intention of destroying all of the companions one by one; eventually\ngetting to the ring-bearer once all the companions are gone. _Swarm_\ndecks have an opposite strategy: their goal is to play as many minions\nas possible as cheaply as possible. While one swarm minion might not be\nvery powerful by itself, each minion is very cheap which allows many to\nbe played, easily outnumbering the companions. While they did exist\nsince the first sets, _bomb_ decks have been gradually gaining\npopularity and have, in some ways, replaced beat-down decks. They\ncombine strategies of both beat-down decks and swarm decks: instead of\nfocusing on one or two powerful minions, they play several minions of\nmedium strength. The goal of a bomb deck is to destroy the weaker\ncompanions, and then swarm the Free Peoples player out.\n\n\nThe movie years\n\nFor the first three years the game's releases followed the movies. A 365\n_base set_ was released each November containing material from the\nupcoming movie. These were followed by two 122-card expansions at\nfour-month intervals. Each base set and the following two expansions\nformed a _block_ named for that base set.\n\nCards were sold in eleven card booster packs consisting of one rare,\nthree uncommon and seven common cards. In approximately one in six packs\na common was replaced by a foiled version of a random card from that\nset. Each set also had two sixty-three card starter decks containing two\ncopies of a promotional face card, three random rares and sixty fixed\ncommons/uncommons (sets 5 and 6 had sixty card starters with three\nalternate image rares in place of the random rares).\n\nBetween the two expansions of the Return of the King block, an extra\nset, Reflections, was released. This consisted of 52 new cards, all\nfoiled, half of which were designated rare plus and half rare. The new\ncards took material from all three films and material produced by Weta\nspecifically for the game and did not belong to any block. Reflections\nboosters contained two of the new cards (with one R+ every 2.4 packs)\nand sixteen repackaged random cards from the first six sets. One of\nthese old cards was always non-English.\n\n\nShadows and beyond\n\nIn November 2004 the new base set, Shadows, marked an overhaul to the\ngame. All sets would now contain sixty each of rare, uncommon and common\ncards and a larger number of starter deck only cards. Shadows also had\nfour, rather than two, different starter decks. The material used for\nthe cards would also now cover the entire trilogy instead of being tied\nto the films' releases.\n\nAdditionally, a system of rotation was announced to be introduced to the\ngame. Starting in March 2005 the entire Fellowship block will cease to\nbe legal for use in the Standard tournament format. Then, each November\nthe oldest block remaining will also be “rotated out”. This helps keep\nthe card pool down to a manageable size and means that new players don't\nhave to buy old products, which can often be hard to find. It also keeps\nestablished players buying new cards.\n\n\nProducts\n\nTo date seventeen sets have been released: (where two dates are listed,\nthe first date refers to starter decks and the second to booster packs):\n\n1.  The Fellowship of the Ring (November 6, 2001)\n2.  Mines of Moria (March 6 & 13, 2002)\n3.  Realms of the Elf-lords (June 19 & July 3, 2002)\n4.  The Two Towers (November 6, 2002)\n5.

Mount Doom (July 14, 2004)\n11. Shadows (November 3, 2004)\n12. Black Rider (March 18, 2005)\n13. Bloodlines (August 12, 2005)\n14. Expanded Middle-earth Deluxe Draft Box (June 2006)\n15.

Ages End (June 22, 2007)\n\nThese two sets was also planned, but they were never released:\n\n1.  The Great Eye (Unknown)\n2.  Shelob's Lair (Unknown)\n\nIn addition a number of boutique products have been released:\n\n-   Oversized Cards (August 2001 - Summer 2003)\n-   Promotional Cards (Spring 2002 - Present)\n-   The Fellowship of the Ring Anthology (July 23, 2003)\n-   The Two Towers Anthology (February 25, 2004)\n-   The Return of the King Anthology (September 2004)\n-   The War of the Ring Anthology (September 2005)\n\nAn online version of the game was also available, but shut down on June\n30, 2010. Sales of digital cards for the game ended on June 30,\n2007."

    "title": "Game of Angband",
    "page_id": "2872",
    "text": "GAME OF ANGBAND is a roguelike computer game derived from _Umoria_. In\nturn, _Umoria_ is C for Unix port of the Game of Moria. Angband is named\nafter Morgoth's fortress, Angband, while Moria is named after the\nunderground city of Moria. Both Sauron and Morgoth are enemy monsters in\nthis game.\n\nThe adventurer must play through 100 levels of the title dungeon,\n“Angband”. Ultimately, the adventurer seeks to amass enough power and\nequipment to ultimately defeat Morgoth. A new level is randomly\ngenerated each time the player changes levels, which gives Angband great\nreplay value: no two games will be the same.\n\n\nDevelopment of the game\n\nThe first version was created by Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand at the\nUniversity of Warwick in 1990. Later, many others enhanced the game,\nwhile even more others forked the game, creating several variants such\nas ToME. The latest version of vanilla Angband, as of 18 June 2005, is\nversion 3.0.6.\n\nOriginally _Angband_ was written entirely in C. Starting in the 3.0\nseries, much of the code has been moved to Lua, an embedded scripting\nlanguage that simplifies development and makes modification into\nvariants simpler. Angband is now available for all major operating\nsystems, including Unix (curses and X11), DOS, Microsoft Windows, Apple\nMacintosh, Amiga, and many others.\n\nThe game's main web site is currently http://www.thangorodrim.net, named\nfor Thangorodrim, the highest mountains of Middle-earth and the location\nof Angband fortress.\n\n\nVariants\n\nA veritable family tree of around sixty (around a dozen of which are\nactive) variants of Angband exist, each often greatly differing in\npurpose and depth of changes. The best known variants are EyAngband,\nHengband, OAngband, ToME, Steamband, and ZAngband.\n\nGameplay of vanilla _Angband_, as the original is now often called, is\nmost often compared to _NetHack_, though in reality the games are almost\npolar opposites. _Angband_ adopts a more serious tone than _NetHack_,\ntakes far longer to win for even the best players, and the focus of the\ngame is more on combat tactics, inventory management and risk\nminimalisation than _NetHack_ish puzzle solving and special casing. This\nhas been the source of light-hearted conflicts between the two\ncommunities.\n\nAlso a multiplayer variant has recently appeared, called _MAngband_,\nwhich is real-time instead of turn-based original game\n(www.mangband.org).\n\n\nCommunity\n\nA Usenet group rec.games.roguelike.angband is a place to discuss all the\naspects of the game. An IRC channel, #angband, exists on the WorldIRC\nnetwork (irc.worldirc.org).\n\n\nSource code licensing\n\nBefore 2009, the source code to _Angband_ was available for modification\nand redistribution, but not free software or open source because it was\nlicensed under “non commercial use” terms, as was its ancestor, the game\nof Moria. An effort called the “Angband Open Source Initiative” asked\ndevelopers to re-license their _Angband_ code under the GNU General\nPublic License; this would allow Angband to appear in free software\ncollections, and also in commercial distributions of GNU/Linux operating\nsystems. On January 8, 2009, Angband 3.0 beta and all versions\nthereafter were released under both the original licence and the GPL. 1\n\n\nDevelopers\n\nAfter Cutler and Astrand, the later principal developers of _Angband_\nincluded Charles Swiger, Ben Harrison and Robert Rühlmann. Harrison was\nthe maintainer responsible for the “Great Code Cleanup”, modularizing,\nextending, and greatly improving the readability of the _Angband_ source\ncode, which lead to the large number of variants of _Angband_ currently\navailable, as well as the rather large number of ports to different\nplatforms.\n\nLike other maintainers, Harrison eventually moved on to other interests,\npassing the title to Robert Rühlmann in 2000. Rühlmann's contributions\nincluded releasing the new major version 3.0, which included Lua\nscripting as well as many monster and object changes contributed by\nJonathan Ellis. Rühlmann stepped down in October, 2005 2, leading to a\nbrief period of uncertainty. It appears that someone has chosen a new\nmaintainer. 3\n\n\nAngband terms\n\n-   ARTIFACT: A special item with preset statistics that cannot be\n    destroyed, and of which only one instance exists. Once identified,\n    they are never generated again.\n-   *BAND: Generic name for any _Angband_ variant.\n-   BORG: An automated _Angband_ player.\n-   EGO ITEM: A standard item with special abilities, which vary\n    according to its ego type. e.g. Soft Leather Boots of _Speed_.\n-   RNG: Random Number Generator/God. Due to the importance of random\n    effects in _Angband_, the game RNG is often referred to\n    anthropomorphically.\n-   UNIQUE: A monster of which only one instance exists. Once killed\n    they are never generated again. They are immune by default to\n    certain types of attack. Systematically finding and killing them can\n    be important to victory in the game, since the hardest few uniques\n    can magically summon other uniques and thereby overpower the player.\n-   VANILLA: The unmodified version of _Angband_, not a variant like\n    ToME.\n-   VAULT: A special room which is not random, but is produced from a\n    plan. Often filled with powerful foes and treasure.\n-   WIZARD: A debug/cheat mode."

It is mostly inspired by the books of J.R.R Tolkien and\nthe films of Peter Jackson, and it has a greater number of units than\nthe original TA:K. There are also a great number of units that weren't\nin the movies, like the Knights of Dol Amroth, the Wainriders and the\nDwarven armies. The TC also features Heroes, so that monarchs aren't the\nonly strong and unique units in the field. They aren't just very strong,\nbut they also give a morale bonus (in the form of extra armor or more\nhealth regeneration). So charging with Rohan riders is much more\nsuccessful if Theoden rides with them.\n\n\nThe Races\n\nThe TC counts a total of eight races; four bad and four good.\n\nGondor: Probably the best known people of the LotR universe, they excel\nin both building and defending. With their trebuchets and strong Citadel\nWalls, their base is quite safe. The soldiers of Gondor are versatile,\nstrong archers, strong infantry and strong riders. One of their greatest\nfeatures is the Army of the Dead and their great number of Heroes\n(Aragorn, Boromir, Faramir, Elendil, Isildur, Imrahil, etc..)\n\nRohan: The people of Rohan are excellent horsemen, and their greatest\nstrength is to keep mobile and to maintain the pressure on the enemy’s\nbase. Their infantry and defense is weaker, but their riders can cause\nmuch damage. With a great variety of riders, they can actually take the\nfighting away from their camps, but if the enemy comes near, they are\nable to defend. The Ents are buildable by Rohan and make great additions\nto save a lost cause.\n\nGaladhrim: The elves are the elite warriors of Middle-earth. They\nperfected the art of combat and their infantry stands above the average,\nbut they are really great with archery. Their heroes and units are very\nstrong and even have a good navy. Their only problem is that they aren't\ncheap. Every elf is expensive, so facing greater numbers is normal with\nthem, but considering their strength of each individual unit, they are\nstrong enough to fight greater armies. With their number of archers it's\nadvised to attack carefully and not charge right in, but give cover as\nmuch as possible.\n\nErebor: The Dwarves of Erebor are masters of siege weapons and armory.\nThey may be slow, but their armors are so tough that arrows aren't\nalways as fatal as with the other races, and their siege can give very\ngood cover while their feared close combat unit's approach. Dwarves are\na little expensive and slower, so while playing against evil races, one\nis advised to beware of a rush.\n\nMordor: Mordor is feared by most enemies. Their average infantry are a\nhorde of Orcs that are only usable in large groups, but a large army is\nnot hard to build for Mordor, as they have low costs and low buildtime.\nBut when they strengthen their hordes with siege weapons, trolls or even\nNazgûl, then their army will swarm over enemy bases. Doesn't it go\nentirely as planned? Let the heroes fall back, or build new ones (it's\nquite cheap) and build another horde. Mordor can (re)build a strong army\nquicker than any of the other races.\n\nIsengard: The army of the White Wizard Saruman is feared in close\nquarters. The Uruk-hai are both very strong and mostly in great numbers.\nUnder the command of their heroes and captains, a large horde of Uruks\ncan even sweep away Elven and Dwarven formations. With pikemen (strong\nvs. Riders), crossbows, swordsmen (strong vs Infantry), and berserkers\n(strong vs. everything) they can instill fear. And while building their\ngreat army of Uruks, they can raid the enemy with their Dunlendings.\n\nMoria: The average Goblin is the weakest unit imaginable, but they are\ngood for one thing; swarming. It's much like Mordor, and the average\nMoria low tier unit is weaker then their Mordor counterparts, but the\naverage Moria hero is as strong or maybe stronger than the average\nMordor hero. Use hordes of Goblins, with Trolls and goblin Kings amongst\nthem and use strong heroes like Smaug and the strongest of all units;\nthe Balrog, as one man armies to demolish them from where they don't\nexpect it.\n\nHarad: The people of Harad are the main part of this army, but their\nallies from Umbar, the Easterlings and the people of Khand are with\nthem, making them the most versatile of all evil races. They aren't\nstrong defenders, having weak towers, but they are efficient nomads.\nThey have the best navy (The Corsairs of Umbar) of all races, and their\ninfantry is both quality and numbers. Their riders are fast and can\neasily lure the enemy. Their biggest (and hardest to control) units are\nthe Mumakil. Limited, but extremely powerful in close combat, they can\ntrample enemy bases.\n\n\nRequirements\n\nThis TC requires TA:K and the Expansion; _The Iron Plague_.\n\n\nConflict of Arda XP\n\nAn expansion to this TC recently came out; even giving it a greater unit\ncount. Some new units include Great Eagles, a Rhovanion tier for Rohan,\na Dunedain tier for Gondor, a destroyed Shire tier for Isengard, and\nmany heroes and other units for the different races. The elves have some\nnew non-mainstream assault units, like spies and banner bearers. The\ndwarves have even better siege and naval units. Mordor and Moria have a\ngreat number of new heroes and specialized units. Harad has some new\nunits to make them even more versatile. Some of the new heroes include,\nRadagast the Brown, Troll Chieftan, Halbarad, Grima, Grishnakh, and\nGorbag.\n\n\nWhere to get the game (External)\n\n-   Conflict of Arda full+Xpansion\n-   Conflict of Arda full\n-   Conflict of Arda Xpansion"

    "text": "The WIZARDS, initially known as the ISTARI, were five Maiar spirits sent\nto Middle-earth as human forms to aid the Free Peoples against the\nthreat of Sauron.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the Undying Lands around TA 1000, Manwë became aware that the spirit\nof Morgoth's most dedicated lieutenant Sauron was rising in power again,\nand summoned a council of the Valar to send three messengers to\nMiddle-earth to protect the free peoples and assure them the Valar had\nnot forgotten them. Two Maiar came: Curumo (or Curunir; later known as\nSaruman) sent by Aulë, and Alatar (Morinehtar), sent by Oromë. Manwë\nasked where Olórin (later known as Gandalf) was, and he came, after\nreturning from a journey. Manwë asked Olórin if he would go as the third\nmessenger. Olórin said he was too weak and that he was afraid of Sauron;\nhowever, Manwë said that was all the more reason to go, and that he\ncommanded Olórin to go as the third. Then Varda said, “Not as the\nthird.” Yavanna begged Curumo to take Aiwendil (Radagast), and Alatar\ntook Pallando (Rómestámo) as a friend. They were forbidden to dominate\nthe free peoples of Middle-earth or to match Sauron's power with power.\nWhen Saruman, the greatest of the Wizards, disobeyed this injunction, he\nwas cast from the order and banished from ever returning to Valinor.\n\nThe Wizards were known by various names and were arrayed in different\ncolors. Of those who came to Middle-earth, sent by the Valar, five are\nknown, the Heren Istarion (Order of Wizards). After arriving in\nMiddle-earth, the two Blue Wizards apparently went east before the War\nof the Ring; whether they played a part in the events of that war is\nunknown. (Note: _According to Tolkien's letters they may have formed\ncults for magic worship and practice among the Easterlings._) Radagast\nthe Brown concerned himself mainly with plants and animals and lived in\nMirkwood for many years. Saruman the White and Gandalf the Grey spent\ntime with the Free Peoples: the Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Saruman was\nwise and respected and became head of the White Council in TA 2463.\nHowever, he became prideful and jealous of the potential and purity of\nspirit of Gandalf, who would eventually surpass him in power. Saruman\nslowly came to betray the original purpose of the Wizards and sought\npower for himself. He was overthrown during the War of the Ring, by his\ntormented servant, Grima Wormtongue. Grima slit Saruman's neck after a\nfailed attempt to rule the Shire. Saruman's spirit looked to the West\nand Valinor but was blown away.\n\nAt the end of the Third Age, the Wizards passed from sight; since, with\nthe fall of Sauron, their work was done. Gandalf passed over the Sea\nwith the Last Riding of the Keepers of the Rings. Saruman became a naked\nspirit and wandered Middle-earth forever since he was banished from\nValinor. Radagast stayed in Middle-earth, tending to the wilderness. The\nfate of the Blue Wizards is unknown.\n\n\nAppearance\n\nThe wizards bore the forms of old Men; they were ancient and seemed to\nage very slowly. They possessed the great skill of body and mind; the\ngreater portion of their power as Maiar resided in their staffs. Each of\nthe Istari had his color and grade within the Order. Saruman the White\nwas the eldest and Gandalf the Grey second. The other Istari was\nRadagast the Brown and the two Blue Wizards, who dwelt far in the east.\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Istari_ is a Quenya word (singular _Istar_). The Sindarin\ntranslation is ''Ithryn ''(singular _Ithron_).\n\n\nNamed wizards\n\n-   CURUMO, the White Wizard, was more commonly known as SARUMAN.\n    However, after being seduced by the evil power of Sauron, Saruman\n    became the Many-Coloured Wizard.\n    -   Saruman (human form) was killed by Gríma Wormtongue following\n        the Battle of Bywater, and Gandalf returned to the Undying Lands\n        in TA 3021. However, the fates of the three other Istari are\n        relatively unknown. Alatar and Pallando disappeared in the east,\n        while Radagast stayed in Middle-earth until at least TA 3018.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   OLÓRIN, the Grey Wizard, was more commonly known as GANDALF.\n    However, after dying at the hands of a Balrog, Durin's Bane, Gandalf\n    was reborn as the new White Wizard.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   AIWENDIL, the Brown Wizard, was more commonly known as RADAGAST.\n    Radagast was a lover of nature and so did not play any major part in\n    the War of the Ring except for announcing to the Great Eagles that\n    Gandalf was at the Orthanc with Saruman.\n\n&nbsp;\n-   ALATAR AND PALLANDO, the Blue Wizards, little is known about them,\n    although Gandalf suspected they may have founded a few magical cults\n    in the east, it is not expressed why he thinks this, although\n    perhaps he noted some strange similarities of knowledge from Maia\n    and knowledge of those cults/teachings (_Note: Later in his life,\n    Tolkien wrote a note, suggesting that the names of the Blue Wizards\n    were Morinehtar and Rómestámo. It is not clear whether these names\n    were intended to replace the names Alatar and Pallando, or whether\n    Morinehtar and Rómestámo were alternate names for the Blue Wizards,\n    possibly those given to them by the peoples of Middle-Earth_).\n\n  The Wizards\n  ------------------- ------------------------------ ----------- -----------------\n  Middle-earth name\n  Saruman\n  Gandalf\n  Radagast\n  Morinehtar\n  Rómestámo\n\n\nGallery"

    "title": "Fairy tale",
    "page_id": "2983",
    "text": "A FAIRY TALE is a story featuring folkloric characters such as fairies,\ngoblins, elves, trolls, giants, and others. The fairy tale is a\nsub-class of the folktale. These stories often involve princes and\nprincesses, and modern versions usually have a happy ending. In cultures\nwhere demons and witches are perceived as real, fairy tales may merge\ninto legendary narratives, where the context is perceived by teller and\nhearers as having historical actuality. However unlike legends and epics\nthey usually do not contain more than superficial references to religion\nand actual places, persons, and events. Although these allusions are\noften critical in understanding the origins of these fanciful stories.\n\nMany people, including Angela Carter in her introduction to the _Virago\nBook of Fairy Tales_ have noted that a great deal of so-called fairy\ntales do not feature fairies at all. This is partly because of the\nhistory of the English term “fairy tale” which derives from the French\nphrase _contes de fée_ which was first used in the collection of Madame\nD'Aulnoy in 1697. As Stith Thompson and Carter herself point out,\ntalking animals and the presence of magic seem to be more common to the\nfairy tale than fairies themselves.   \n\nSome folklorists prefer to use the German term _Märchen_ to refer to\nfairy tales, a practice given weight by the definition of Stith Thompson\nin his 1977 edition of _The Folktale_: “a tale of some length involving\na succession of motifs or episodes. It moves in an unreal world without\ndefinite locality or definite creatures and is filled with the\nmarvelous. In this never-never land humble heroes kill adversaries,\nsucceed to kingdoms and marry princesses.” (Thompson: 8)\n\n\nHistory\n\nAlthough in the late nineteenth and twentieth century the fairy tale\ncame to be associated with children's literature, adults were originally\nas likely as children to be the audience of the fairy tale. The fairy\ntale was part of an oral tradition: tales were narrated orally, rather\nthan written down, and handed down from generation to generation. The\ntales often had sad endings; such was the penalty for dealing with the\nfairy folk.\n\nLater fairy tales were about princes and princesses, combat, adventure,\nsociety, and romance. Fairies had a secondary role. Moral lessons and\nhappy endings were more common, and the villain was usually punished. In\nthe modern era, fairy tales were altered, usually with violence removed,\nso they could be read to children (who according to a common modern\nsentiment should not hear about violence).\n\nSometimes fairy tales are simply miraculous entertainments, but often\nthey are disguised morality tales. This is true for the Brothers Grimm\n_Kinder- und Hausmärchen_, and much of the drily witty, dead-pan, social\ncriticism beneath the surface of Hans Christian Andersen's tales, which\ninfluenced Roald Dahl.\n\nThe fairy tale has ancient roots, older than the “Arabian Nights”\ncollection of magical tales, in antiquity: Cupid and Psyche, Bel and the\nDragon. Fairy tales resurfaced in literature in the 17th century, with\nthe Neapolitan tales of Giambattista Basile and the later _Contes_ of\nCharles Perrault, who fixed the forms of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.\n\nAn extensive collection of European fairy tales were published by Andrew\nLang in a series of books: _The Red Fairy Book_, _The Orange Fairy\nBook_, and so forth. These provide some excellent examples of the genre.\n\nAccording to a 2004 poll of 1,200 children by UCI Cinemas, the most\npopular fairy tales (in the USA?) are:\n\n1.  Cinderella\n2.  Sleeping Beauty\n3.  Hansel and Gretel\n4.  Rapunzel\n5.  Little Red Riding Hood\n6.  Town Musicians\n\nIn addition, the _Arabian Nights_ stories like _Aladdin and his\nWonderful Lamp_ and _wikipedia:Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves_ are often\nthought to be fairy tales themselves.\n\n\nContemporary fairy tales\n\nIn contemporary literature, many authors have used the form of fairy\ntales for various reasons, such as examining the human condition from\nthe simple framework a fairytale provides. Some authors seek to recreate\na sense of the fantastic in a contemporary discourse. Sometimes,\nespecially in children's literature, fairy tales are retold with a twist\nsimply for comic effect, such as _The Stinky Cheese Man_ by Jon\nScieszka. Other authors may have specific motives, such as multicultural\nor feminist reevaluations of predominantly Eurocentric masculine\ndominated fairy tales, implying critique of older narratives. The figure\nof the damsel in distress has been particularly attacked by many\nfeminist critics. Examples of narrative reversal rejecting this figure\ninclude _The Paperbag Princess_, by Robert Munsch, a picture book aimed\nat children in which a princess rescues a prince, or Angela Carter’s\n_The Bloody Chamber_, which retells a number of fairytales from a female\npoint of view.\n\nOther notable figures who have employed fairy tales include A. S. Byatt,\nJane Yolen, Donald Barthelme, Robert Coover, Margaret Atwood, Tanith\nLee, James Thurber, Kelly Link, John Bly and many others.\n\n    _Fairy tales are more than true -_\n    _not because they tell us dragons exist,_\n    _but because they tell us dragons can be beaten._\n\n&nbsp;\n\n    'G. K. CHESTERTON''"

    "text": "The self-named '''King's Men '''hailed from Númenor. They were\nNúmenóreans who rebelled against the angelic Valar because of their\ndesire for immortality. After Númenór was consequently destroyed, those\nKing's Men who remained were known as Black Númenóreans, hostile to\nGondor.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThough the King's Men had enjoyed generations of favor from the Kings of\nNúmenor, and no doubt helped in oppressing the Faithful as the Kings\ngrew more suspicious of them, eventually a supporter of the Faithful\ntook the Sceptre once again. This King's name was Tar-Palantir. He\nwished to return Númenor to a state of friendship with the West, but the\nmajority of the Númenóreans still clung to the policies of the King's\nMen. Tar-Palantir's younger brother, Gimilkhâd, sided with his\nrebellious fathers, however. He took up the leadership of the King's Men\nand stood in opposition to his brother, but generally kept his doings\nsecret.\n\nIt was probably to a few lords of the King's Men that Sauron came to\ndeliver some of the Nine Rings of Power, for three of the Nazgûl were\nsaid to be “lords of Númenórean race”. Most of the King's Men living in\nMiddle-earth Sauron and his servants assailed, however. Eventually, the\nlast King of Númenor, Ar-Pharazôn the son of Gimilkhâd, resolved to\ndefeat Sauron in retaliation for this aggression, and he and his men\nsailed to Middle-earth and captured the Maia.\n\nOnce in Númenor, Sauron completed the corruption of the King's Men with\nease, inciting them to worship Melkor and use the few Faithful still\nliving in the land as sacrifices. They also brutally oppressed the Men\nof Middle-earth during this period. The corrupting power of Sauron\naffected their minds deeply, so that they became “quick to anger”, and\nhated all those in the land more fortunate than them. Nor did they\nescape death, for all sorts of sicknesses and mental afflictions\nassailed them, to the point that they “cursed themselves in their\nagony”. When the Valar sent messages of warning in the form of\neagle-shaped clouds to them, they fell upon their faces in great fear,\nand some repented of their actions for a while. In the end, however,\nSauron's mastery over them was so complete that he could walk about the\nland “setting man against man”, and cause them to slay each other. At\nlast, when Ar-Pharazôn had grown old and was in great fear of death,\nSauron persuaded him to take a great army to Aman and challenge the\nValar for immortality. When he did this, his army foundered in the Sea\nand Númenor was also destroyed. Most of the King's Men thus perished\nin the destruction of Ar-Pharazôn's fleet and the Downfall of Númenor,\nbut those who had taken up residence in Middle-earth survived. When\nSauron returned to Mordor, they entered into his service once again, and\nbecame known as the Black Númenóreans.\n\n\nAfter the Downfall\n\n  For many centuries after\nthe Downfall, these descendants of the King's Men held onto the Haven of\nUmbar, the most northerly and famous of their realms.\n\nWhen the surviving Faithful Numenoreans founded Gondor and Arnor, they\nsaw their southern counterparts as renegades, calling them the Black\nNúmenóreans. The Black Númenóreans held a similar hatred of Arnor and\nGondor for generations.\n\nTwo early Black Númenórean lords from the late Second Age were Herumor\nand Fuinur who desired power over men of other, lesser races, and they\n“rose to (great) power amongst the Haradrim”, the peoples neighbouring\nUmbar. They likely shared Sauron's defeat at the hands of the Last\nAlliance of Elves and Men.\n\nThe triumph of the Last Alliance marked the decline of the Black\nNúmenórean race and the end of their racial superiority. They dwindled\nswiftly or became merged with the Middle Men.\n\nQueen Berúthiel, wife of Gondor's King Tarannon Falastur was “a black\nNúmenórean”. This was a loveless union, and was presumably a\npolitical accommodation: that such arrangements were possible implies\nthe existence at that time of more Gondor-friendly Black Númenóreans\nthan the much later Mouth of Sauron.  A\nBlack Númenórean elite survived at least in Umbar for over a thousand\nyears after Númenor's fall, maintaining much influence in Haradwaith. As\nlate as Third Age 1015, for example, even after being exiled from their\nhomeland for nearly a century, the lords that had been driven from Umbar\nled the Haradrim to retake Umbar.\n\nNot much is known about the Black Númenóreans after their defeat by\nCiryaher in T.A. 1050. A “Renegade”, The Mouth of Sauron, had entered\nthe service of Sauron in Mordor. He mocked the army of King Elessar in\nfront of the Morannon.\n\nBlack Numenorean by Jan Pospisil.png Imgres-3.jpeg Ten Cats of Queen\nBeruthiel by Steamey.jpg Black Númenóreans doing a ritual.JPG The Mouth\nof Sauron.jpg The Lord of the Rings War in the North - Men of Carn\nDûm.jpg\n\n\nPolicies\n\nBecause the Shadow lay heavy upon their hearts, the King's Men greatly\nfeared Death and “sought to delay it by all means that they could”.\nThese attempts to escape their fate actually brought death upon them\nsooner, and the lifespans of their Kings waned. They filled the land of\nNúmenor with great tombs to preserve the memory of their dead. In the\nmeantime, their everyday lives became ever more decadent: to ease their\nfears, they “drank and they feasted and they clad themselves in silver\nand gold”."

    "text": "The action of _The Lord of the Rings_ is largely confined to the\nnorth-west of Endor, implicitly corresponding to modern-day EUROPE.\n\nActually, Tolkien explicitly stated that his novels were not\nallegorical. In fact, quoting his own words, he “despised allegory in\nall its manifestations”.\n\nThe Professor often stated that the Shire intentionally resembled rural\nEngland, as well as he granted the exact detail that the Shire and\nImladris are positioned at about the latitude of Oxford (United\nKingdom), where he used to live and work. Apart from this, most of the\ngeography only vaguely matches up with actual Europe, and in every\ninterpretation there are many elements that lack any correspondence.\n\n\nProposed interpretations\n\nEriador is always the United Kingdom, and the Shire is always the\ncountryside of England.\n\nEurope during the Cold War (1950's)\n\nIn an interpretation very common in Europe, Middle-earth corresponds to\nEurope during Cold War. Therefore, the _Lord of the Rings_ would be an\nallegory for the present time when it was written.\n\nMordor corresponds to the Soviet Union and the Communist Block, Valinor\n(across the ocean) corresponds to the United States, the rest of Middle\nEarth corresponds to Western Europe. Gondor and Ithilien (East Gondor)\ncorrespond to West Germany and East Germany, respectively.\n\nSaruman and Isengard can be seen as Yugoslavia, that broke the alliance\nwith Soviet Union and stood by itself. Alternatively, they can be seen\nas the Communist parties in west European countries, that somewhat try\nto betray and backstab the peoples they live with.\n\nThe Haradrim correspond to the Arab countries. Southern Europe (e.g.\nSpain, Italy, Greece) escape this interpretation.\n\nEurope and Nazism (late 1930's - early 1940's)\n\nThe evil land of Mordor can be identified with Germany. Therefore,\nIthilien would represent the lands conquered by Germany at the beginning\nof the war, and in particular German-occupied France. Gondor would then\nbe the Vichy France. Mirkwood and Dale would be Denmark and Norway.\n\nThe allies of Mordor, i.e. the wild Eastern men and the Haradrim, would\ncorrespond to the willing allies of Nazist Germany: Finland, Hungary and\nRomania to the East and North, Italy and Spain to the South.\n\nNeutral countries (Switzerland, Sweden) escape this interpretation.\n\nEurope during late Middle Ages\n\n\n\nIt is better to say that in Midde-Earth, the actual geography and the\ncultural landscapes over Europe are separated in scale.\n\nThe Easterlings f.e. have been commonly interpreted to have properties\nsimilar to huns, mongols or turkic peoples in studies, but on the\nMiddle-earth maps set according to given scale and superimposed over\nEurope (as the one on the page), these would be mainly coming from much\nnearer than the said cultures. Taking the scale given on the map as a\nfact, we might find similarities between Easterlings and Gothic culture\nin the migration period, when they were taking over lands once inhabited\nby continental Celts. The two sizes (cultural and geographical) of\nMiddle-earth make direct comparisons to modern day Europe and it is\nhistory somewhat awkward and many interpretations have been given. The\nscale given on the map included in the Lord of the Rings states NW-parts\nof Middle-Earth would be about 4 millions km² and some, but the cultural\nreferences to European history no doubt span the whole Europe and likely\nparts of North Africa and Middle East... Culturally we might take the\nsize of NW Middle-Earth to be exactly the same size than Europe (10,2\nMkm²). This introduces ambiguity with respect to which cultures in Real\nLife are analogues to which in Ea, with the exception of The Shire,\nwhich is an analogue of English countryside and its culture. Below is a\ndescription of one of the theories of this conundrum, one which is quite\ncommonly used in this context.\n\nStarting in the northwest, Lindon corresponds to the remnants of Celtic\nEurope; and like Celtic Europe (Ireland, Man, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall,\nand Brittany) it is populated by a peoples who were once more populous\nand widespread than they are now, and have been relegated to the\nfurthest reaches of their respective continents.\n\nTherefore the Old Forest and Bree are positioned roughly about the\nsouth-east of England, possibly Norfolk, although this is unconfirmed.\n\nEriador is curious, because it shows simultaneous elements of many\nperiods in the history of Great Britain, the area which it is most\nanalogous to. The Shire is, naturally, medieval and early modern England\n(one can gather this especially by the Shire Reckoning, which according\nto them places the end of the Third Age in the 15th century). The native\npeoples of Eriador (of which the Bree-folk are remnants) resemble the\nCeltic natives of Great Britain from before, during, and after the Roman\noccupation. The greatest evidence for this is the physical description\nof Breelanders (dark hair, stout) and place-names, which the Professor\nlifted from Brythonic ('bre', meaning “hill”; 'cwm', meaning “valley”;\nand 'chet' meaning “wood, forest”). The Romans themselves are the\nNumenoreans, and the fragmentation and fall of Arnor is very similar to\nthe Roman evacuation of Britain at the start of the 5th century. The\nMisty Mountains do not readily conform to anything found in Europe;\nhowever aesthetically they are extremely similar to the Alps.\n\nContinuing east into Rhovanion one comes to Germanic Europe. In the\nNorth there is the Bardings, Beornings, and other Northmen, whose\nlanguage is Scandinavian and most of whom have names lifted from the\nmythology of ancient Scandinavia (Gimli, Gandalf, Bard, Beorn, Dale,\netc.). Moving south through Mirkwood one comes to the princes of\nRhovanion who aided Gondor in its wars against the East. These have\nnames largely of Gothic origin, who lived in many of the wooded plains\nof eastern Europe during the Migration Period. Lastly we come to the\nRohirrim, who despite living in the wrong place geographically, are\nculturally and linguistically most similar to the ancient English who\nsettled in Britain. Like the ancient English (and the ancient Germans,\nwhen they settled southern Germany) they adopted a new home in a land\nlargely populated by Romano-Celts (Dunlendings, under the'' de jure''\nauthority of Gondor) after the collapse or reduction of Roman authority\n(depopulation in the case of Calenardhon). The works left there, such as\nHelm's Deep, are beyond the skill of the Rohirrim to match, but they\nlive among them and utilize them (as the aqueducts, baths, and cities of\nthe Romans were beyond the ability of the ancient English and Germans).\nThe Anduin is very similar to the Danube, despite the reversal in\norientation, due to its prodigious length and its largely flat and\nmeandering course, surrounded chiefly by woodland and occasional hills.\nThe White Mountains do not exactly conform to the Alps, but like the\nMisty Mountains are most similar to them, as well as the Dinaric Alps\nand the Carpathians.\n\nIn the South there is Gondor, which is most akin to the Byzantine\nEmpire. Both are ruled from “new” cities (Minas Tirith and\nConstantinople) who are named for older places (Minas Tirith for Minas\nTirith (First Age); Constantinople for Rome, as its true name was 'Nova\nRoma'). Both are remnants of a once-greater civilization, who suffer\nfrom both prolonged pressures from the outside, chiefly the east; as\nwell as internal strife and plague. Indeed the two are so similar that\nthe Siege of Minas Tirith practically plays out as a 'what-if' of the\nFall of Constantinople in 1453. Mordor falls into the area of Anatolia,\nCilicia, and the Caucasus. Like the Ottomans and the ancient Persians,\nSauron creates an empire in this area that encompasses many desperate\npeoples, which he uses to wage war against the West. Harad is a\nconglomeration of North Africa and the Levant. Both have been either\nruled by, cooperative with, or antagonistic against their respective\nWests at various times, and both are geographically in the same place.\nThe use of elephants in war was also a common feature of North Africa in\nAntiquity, which fits with the Haradric habit of utilizing Mumakil. This\nfurther places Far Harad with Sub-Saharan Africa, which explains the\nblack troll-men seen at the Siege of Minas Tirith.\n\nRhûn is a slight conglomeration. Geographically it resembles the Volga\nriver basin and the steppes of Central Asia. The cultures of the eastern\npeoples do not perfectly fit, due to the Professor only providing vague\nextrapolations, but the nomadic habits of many of these peoples (the\nBalcoth and the Wainriders) fits with many cultures who were indigenous\nto the Volga region throughout history (the Scythians, the Bulgars, the\nTurks, etc.). One of the named peoples, the Variags, derived their name\nfrom _varyag_, the Slavic name for Norse adventurers and traders who\ntraveled throughout Eastern Europe and Central Asia around the 10th to\nthe 12th centuries.\n\npl:Europa"

    "text": "“MIDDLE-EARTH CALENDAR” refers to one of the systems of keeping time.\n\n\nElven calendar\n\nThe Elves, owing to their longevity, reckoned in a period of 144 years\ncalled, in Quenya, the _yén_. This was divided into 8766 six-day\n“weeks”, or _enquier_. They also recognised the solar year, which was\ncalled a _coranar_ (“sun-round”) or _loa_ (“growth”). In Rivendell, the\n_loa_ began on the spring equinox and was divided into six “months” or\nseasons, as follows.\n\n  QUENYA NAME   SINDARIN NAME   ENGLISH TRANSLATION   DURATION\n  ------------- --------------- --------------------- ----------\n  _tuilë_       _ethuil_        Spring                54 days\n  _lairë_       _laer_          Summer                72 days\n  _yávië_       _iavas_         Autumn                54 days\n  _quellë_      _firith_        Fading                54 days\n  _hrívë_       _rhîw_          Winter                72 days\n  _coirë_       _echuir_        Stirring              54 days\n\nFive other days, two between _coirë_ and _tuilë_ (called _Yestare_ and\n_Mettare_) and three between _yávië_ and _hrívë_ (called the _enderi_),\nmeant the calendar added up to 365 days. Irregularities were allowed for\nby adding another three days every twelve years, except the last year of\na _yén_.\n\nThe year (_loa_) begins on March 21st. That day is called _Yestare_. The\nnext day begins the season of _tuile_. _Tuil'e_ ends on May 14th.\n_Laire _begins on May 15th and ends on July 25th. _Yavie_ begins on July\n26th and ends on September 17th. The next three days are the _enderi_\n(September 18th, 19th, and 20th). _Quelle_begins on September 21st and\nends on November 13th. Then'' Hrive ''starts on the 14th. It ends on\nJanuary 24th. _Coire _begins on January 25th and ends on March 19th. The\nnext day is ''Mettare. '' These dates only work until the enderi have\nbeen doubled. Once every twelve years the elves would double the\n''enderi ''to replace having a leap year.\n\n\nNúmenórean Calendar\n\nThe calendar adopted by the Men of Middle-earth was called the King's\nReckoning, and was very similar to our own. It had a week of seven days,\nand divided the 365-day year of the Elves into twelve months (_astar_),\nten with 30 days and two with 31. Also like our calendar, the Númenórean\nyear began in midwinter. They retained the two days between the end of\none year and the start of the next (_mettarë_ and _yestarë_), but\nreduced the mid-year days to one (_loëndë_, essentially adding the other\ntwo to the mid-year “long months”). Leap years had two mid-year days. In\nthe Second and Third Ages, years were reckoned from the beginning of the\nAge.\n\nVarious irregularities occurred in this calendar, especially following\nthe Downfall. In TA 2060, Mardil Voronwë revised the calendar, and the\nnew version became the Steward's Reckoning. The months of Steward's\nReckoning all had 30 days, and there were two additional “extra” days at\nthe equinoxes, _tuilérë_ and _yáviérë_. The five extra days (the\nequinoxes, midsummer and two at midwinter) were holidays.\n\nIn TA 3021, the Reunited Kingdom adopted a New Reckoning, which began\nthe year on the spring equinox, as in the Elven calendar.\n\nThe months of the Reckonings were in Quenya (or Sindarin among the\nDúnedain) and were:\n\n  QUENYA NAME   SINDARIN NAME\n  ------------- ---------------\n  Narvinyë      Narwain\n  Nénimë        Nínui\n  Súlìmë        Gwaeron\n  Víressë       Gwirith\n  Lótessë       Lothron\n  Náríë         Nórui\n  Cermië        Cerveth\n  Urimë         Urui\n  Yavannië      Ivanneth\n  Narquelië     Narbeleth\n  Hísimë        Hithui\n  Ringarë       Girithron\n\n\nHobbit Calendar\n\n(More detail can be found under Shire Calendar)\n\nThe Hobbits, who had adopted the King's Reckoning, altered it in a\ndifferent way from the Steward's Reckoning. Like the Steward's\nReckoning, they had twelve months of thirty days, and five holidays\noutside the months. However, they had three “extra” days in midsummer\nand two in midwinter, similar to the Elven calendar. In the Shire the\nthree days of midsummer were called Lithedays, and the two days of\nmidwinter were the Yuledays. In leap years, the extra day was added to\nthe Lithedays and called Overlithe. The other innovation in the Shire\ncalendar was to make Midsummer's Day (and the Overlithe) outside the\nweek, as well as the month, meaning the days of the week would not\nchange in relation to the days of the year. The Shire Reckoning is the\ncalendar used in the _Red Book of Westmarch_, and hence in _The Lord of\nthe Rings_. It counts from the founding of the Shire in TA 1600.\n\nThe Hobbit names of the months came from names used in Anduin in\nantiquity, and their meanings were often obscure or forgotten. They\nwere:\n\n  SHIRE NAME      BREE NAME\n  --------------- ------------------------\n  2 Yule          2 Yule\n  Afteryule       Frery\n  Solmath         Solmath\n  Rethe           Rethe\n  Astron          Chithing\n  Thrimidge       Thrimidge\n  Forelithe       Lithe\n  1 Lithe         First Summerday\n  Midyear's Day   Second Summerday\n  Overlithe       Third Summerday\n  2 Lithe         Third/Fourth Summerday\n  Afterlithe      Mede\n  Wedmath         Wedmath\n  Halimath        Harvestmath\n  Winterfilth     Wintring\n  Blotmath        Blooting\n  Foreyule        Yulemath\n  1 Yule          1 Yule\n\n(Given the decidedly Old English sound of these names, it can be assumed\nthat this is J.R.R.

    "title": "Tolkien Mythology",
    "page_id": "3946",
    "text": "“TOLKIEN MYTHOLOGY” and “THE LEGENDARIUM” are both terms for the entire\nsystem of connected, fantastical stories that exemplify the beliefs and\nphilological expertise of J.R.R. Tolkien, and make up the entire\nextensive background to _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\n_For an explanation of the variants of the qualifiers “canon” and\n“precanon” on this Wiki, see LOTR:Canon._\n\nThe stories comprising Tolkien's mythology are not true, but many of\nthem are founded in some sort of fact about the natural world or as a\nway of explaining natural phenomena. In fact, Tolkien imaginatively\nintended them to be a creative legendarium for the continent of Europe,\nand they are meant to be taken fictitiously as an ancient history of the\nEarth (particularly Europe), from several thousand years before the\nmodern era.\n\n“A SINGLE, FICTIONAL, IMAGINARY, FANCIFUL WORLD” is a correct way to\ndescribe the legendarium, so use of the grander and wider term\n“fictional universe” should be halted. In use, the term ''legendarium\n''refers to both the final, canonical lore of Arda and lore that can be\nconsidered precanonical or semi-invented (such as Tolkien's writings of\nEriol or Kullervo).\n\n\nMythological roots of Tolkien's legendarium\n\nIt is a well-known fact that Tolkien had an interest in the mythology\nand linguistics of Northern Europe, specifically the pagan mythologies\nof the Norse and English peoples. The other main influence was Finnish\nMythology - it played a major role in the creation of _The\nSilmarillion_, and the Quenya language was modeled mostly after the\nFinnish language. Two other examples of linguistic influences were\nRohirric, the language used for the Rohirrim which was substituted by\nOld English (from which English is chiefly derived), and the language\nspoken in Dale and Esgaroth, equivalent to Old Norse, which is the\nlanguage of the epic sagas and poems of the Norse.\n\nMany significant events of Middle-earth's history - such as Smaug's\nawakening and rampage, the finding of the Ring, and the reforging\nof Narsil - all have parallels in Germanic Mythology. The epic poetry of\nNorthern Europe's past, such as the epic poem _Beowulf_ and\n'Völsungasaga', have also been cited as influencing Tolkien and his\nlegendarium. The rampage of Smaug could in fact be seen to be inspired\nby _Beowulf_, in which a cup is stolen from the sleeping wyrm who then\nleaves his cave for revenge. (His revenge is the climax of the story,\nand the demise of the protagonist Beowulf).\n\nThe One Ring is said by many to have been inspired by the ring in the\nNorse saga of the Völsungs and its later German version, the High\nMedieval _Nibelunglied_; however comments by Tolkien make it unclear as\nto whether it was a reference to the _Völsungasaga_. Alternatively the\nRing could have been based on a ring of invisibility from Greek\nMythology.\n\nÉowyn's disguising as a man in _The Return of the King_ is likely to\necho many tales of 'Shield-maidens' and Valkyries from Norse Mythology.\n\nThe threads of the legendarium run so deep that even the name of the\nchief continent, _Middle-earth_, has its origins in Norse Mythology\nalso. The name derives from the Old English _Middanġeard_ (meaning\n“middle enclosure”) which later became the Middle English term\n_Middel-erde_ (meaning now “Middle-earth” rather than the older sense of\n“Middle-yard”). This name for our world has cognates in the various\nother Germanic languages: _Miðgarðr_ in Old Norse (rendered as “Midgard”\nin Modern English), and ''Mittelerde ''in Modern German.\n\n\nThe Creation of Arda\n\n_Main article: Ainulindalë_\n\nWithin the legendarium, the Creation of Arda is attributed to Eru\nIlluvatar, the One. He is the God in Tolkien's mythology, and he speaks\nit into existence, with the word _Eä_, which means “It is” in what would\nbecome Elvish. ''Eä ''is thus the original term for and name of Arda.\n\nEru had produced from his thought angelic spirits, all good in nature,\nnamed the Ainur, and asked them to sing to Him a melodious tune, to\nwhich he added his own splendorous themes. The music of this defined the\nchanges and events that would take place on Arda after its approaching\nmanifestation. One of the Ainur was Melkor, whose name later became\n_Morgoth_, who was evil, from whom all evil would stem in Middle-earth\nand Arda as a whole. Melkor introduced his own evil discords into the\nmain musical theme, disrupting its harmony. In this instance Eru put a\nstop to the music at once, and manifested all of Eä immediately.\n\nSome of the Ainur were surprised by the grandeur of this new creation\nand longed for experience in it - so did Melkor, but with wholly\ndifferent purposes. Eru granted the Ainur with the choice of living in\nArda or staying with him in the Timeless Halls, free of physical form\nand time itself. Some of the Ainur chose to enter Arda, and so did\nMelkor. Eru's first intentions during the “Ainulindalë”, or the music\ncreated by the Ainur, also called the First Music of the Ainur, was to\ncreate a somewhat symmetrical world, flat in nature. But Melkor's\ndiscords marred it beyond repair and is supposedly what created the vast\nmountain ranges and hills.\n\nThe Ainur that entered Arda were called the _Valar_ (in singular,\n_Vala_). The leader and most powerful of the Valar was Manwë. Melkor, or\nMorgoth, was also the most powerful Valar during those times until his\nreign as “Dark Lord” of Arda. Under the Valar were less powerful spirits\ncalled the _Maiar_, amongst whom Sauron was one (the main antagonist of\n_The Lord of the Rings_). Maiar were often designated to specific Valar,\neach Valar having been given a particular skill which the Maiar below\nhim or her would carry out. Sauron was the leader amongst the Vala\nAulë's Maiar, whose specific skill was smithery - and from this he would\ncome to have the ability to craft the One Ring an age later.\n\n\nThe physical state of Arda (Eä)\n\nArda after its creation was originally flat in shape, containing mainly\nthe continent of Middle-earth and Aman to “Extreme West”, known as the\nUndying Lands, where the Valar lived and later on where the Elves lived\nduring the dawn of the Dominion of Men. When the King of Númenor\nAr-Pharazôn tried to reach the Undying Lands as a way to become\nimmortal, due to the corrupting powers of Sauron and Morgoth, Eru\nIlluvatar, at the request of the Valar, removed the entire continent\nfrom Arda and reshaped it into a sphere, which is the shape of the Earth\ntoday.\n\nEven though Aman was removed from Arda, and all paths on Arda are now\nbent, there remained a straight path across the sea that only the Elves\nor those granted special access (e.g. the ring-bearing Hobbits Bilbo,\nFrodo and Sam, along with Gimli) could travel. In this way those allowed\nto take this path were able to travel outside the realm of Arda and so\npass to Aman. Because this path was only open to the Elves, the mortal\nraces of Middle-earth (Men, Dwarves, Hobbits etc.) were unable to ever\nagain come within sight of the Blessed Realm during life.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n_The Lord of the Rings_, Tolkien said, was a book created with the theme\nof Death integrated into it. The story gives people a wider\nperspective into the dangers of greed, malice, lust and power-hunger\nsymbolically through the image of the One Ring.\n\nFrodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee are two of the characters in _The Lord\nof the Rings_ who show a willful acceptance of death much before their\ntime, seemingly experiencing memories during their travels to Mordor of\nnever having a return journey back, implying their impression of dying\nafter destroying the One Ring in the Crack of Doom. They return, only\nfor Frodo to leave with Gandalf and Bilbo to Aman or the Undying Lands\nwhere Frodo passes away, accepting Eru Illuvatar's Gift. Samwise also\nmakes this journey Westward to the Undying Lands, after living a happy\nlife with Rosie Cotton and conceiving many children.\n\nTolkien tries to imply the fact that every one of us must accept death\nas a natural part of our lives on Earth, and must not give into the\nimmoral aspects of life brought about due to the dark presences of\nMorgoth and Sauron. Tolkien even, as mentioned earlier, attributes Arda\nas not another fictional dimension of the Earth, but a set of actual\nevents happening about 6,000 to 8,000 years ago in our own history.\n\n\nWorks\n\nTolkien Mythology is manifested in the following books:\n\n-   The Silmarillion\n-   Unfinished Tales\n-   The Children of Húrin\n-   The Hobbit\n-   The Lord of the Rings\n-   Beren and Lúthien\n-   The History of Middle-earth - a twelve-volume series\n\n\nReferences"

    "page_id": "4111",
    "text": "SIRAYN\n(“Watered-earth”) was a region of the Greater Harad. It was the\nintellectual and economic hub of southern Middle-earth. Its territory\ncomprises the fertile hills and vales along the northern flank of the\nYellow Mountains, and can be divided into five major areas: Isra,\nKirmlesra (including Kirmlesran Hills and the Dalad Kirm), the eastern\ncoast and forest of Sára Bask, the plain of Chennacatt, and the Tûr\nBetark.\n\nThe cities of Sirayn were founded along the Sîresha river and its\ntributaries. The cool streams and rolling grasslands characteristic of\nthe river valley provide a welcome relief to weary travelers coming from\nBozisha-Dar or Harshandat.\n\n\nHistory\n\nSecond Age\n\nEarly in the Second Age, apysaic speaking nomadic tribes from the north\nand east settled the fertile river valleys of Sirayn, when they found\nextensive stands of wild wheat and barley growing on the banks of the\nSîresha. Due to the abundance of wild grains, the nomads ceased to\nwander, because the sufficient grains could be gathered during the\nsummer and fall to last the rest of the year. Unaccustomed to the cycles\nof agricultural life, the inhabitants grew restless in the leisure that\nfollowed the growing season. Craft specialization and social\nstratification evolved to fill the void, with the development of a\npriest hierarchy, temples, and a noble class.\n\nAt around SA 450, the building of the cities of Chennacatt and Tûl Isra\nstarts, and at around SA 600, thirteen independently self-governing\ncities are fully established along the Sîresha river and its\ntributaries. In SA 1211, Bávor's Folk found the city of Mablad-dûm in\nthe central Yellow Mountains.\n\nAs the population grew, pressure to expand into less fertile areas\nincreased. The inhabitants tried to duplicate the vast grain fields that\ngrew naturally in the more arable valleys. Over the centuries, they\ndeveloped irrigation techniques and learned the basics of dry farming.\nCanals and irrigation works abounded, as most major highways were\naccompanied by irrigation tunnels running alongside the pavement.\n\nAgriculturists expanded the plants that grew naturally and domesticated\nnew varieties. Hybrid strains of wheat and barley, lentils, grass peas,\ndates, figs and linseed were developed. Some groups returned to the\nnomadic life and domesticated various animals, such as goats, sheep,\ncattle and pigs, indigenous to the region. Other nomadic tribes entered\nthe area and lived by raiding or adopted the new life style. The\npresence of bandits and desert-raiders helped to promote the foundation\nof defensible urban centers.\n\nAs the cities grew, temples were founded, writing was developed, trade\nwas formalized between the urban centers and outside cultures, a fixed\nmilitary was organized, and craft specialization flourished. The region\ncontinued developing until Akhôrahil, the Blind Sorcerer, one of the\nNine Nazgûl, began his conquest of Sirayn in SA 1929. Early in the year,\nthe Blind Sorcerer attacks Baud Selen, and by the end of the year, all\nof Chennacatt has fallen to his Ciryatandan forces. In SA 1930,\nAkhôrahil sends his general Wyatan to conquer Tûl Isra and the lands to\nthe east, and in SA 1933, early in the year, Rask and Tûl Isra fall to\nWyatan's forces. Late in the year, Tyarett succumbs. The forces of\nWyatan attack the city of Chamesra in SA 1935, but the combined forces\nof Chamesra and Tûl Harar are able to win the battle at the expense of\nthe city which is ruined in the process. In SA 1940, Wyatan re-assembles\nhis forces and starts a 59 year campaign against Tûl Harar and\nHarshandat.\n\nThe nomads of Kirmlesra submit to Ankhôril in SA 1979, after 10 years of\ninternal strife. In SA 1995, the surrender of Tûl Harar spells doom for\nHarshandat, falling one day before the new millenium, in SA 1999. The\nBlind Sorcerer places governors in each province and city and begins his\nrule in the South. A Númenórean army defeats Ankhôril and razes his\ncapital in SA 2280, making him flee to Mordor. In SA 2281, the people of\nSirayn and Harshandat rise up and overthrow the Númenóreans, destroying\nthe remaining cities of Tûl Isra and Chennacatt in the process. Only the\nseaport city of Tûl Harar remains standing, as it did not oppose the\nBlind Sorcerer's occupation plans, thus, is the only city in Sirayn that\nhas been continuously inhabited from the mid-Second Age.\n\nThird Age\n\nEarly in the Third Age, Haradrim tribes from the north resettled the\nriver valleys and founded camps along the northern foothills of the Tûr\nBetark to the south. The discovery of rich ores and mineral resources\nand the new trade routes that developed gave rise to a very prosperous\nsociety. Towns and villages sprang up again along the major rivers, and\npeace reigned.\n\nAround TA 1100, orcs and demons from the south took over the mines and\nlaid siege to the towns and villages closest to the Tûr Betark. By TA\n1175, even the newly re-founded city of Tûl Isra had fallen to the\nsoutherly borders. In the spring of TA 1201, Obed, the First, of clan\nMásra, reunited the peoples of Chennacatt, Tûl Isra, and Kirmlesra and\nset out to recapture the lands that were lost. Wielding the famous Blade\nof Másra, a sword passed down through generations of the clan, and the\nVisor of Sirayn, a holy relic dedicated to the Master of the Sands,\nObed's campaign was successful. All of the lands were recovered except\nfor some mines to the south. Obed was slain during the final battles\nnear Horse-head's Peak and was there entombed. From that time, the Blade\nand the Visor have not been seen.\n\nIn TA 1380, Bazaud Izain, of clan Bulgan, a rival to clan Másra, seized\nthe crown and put down clan Másra partisans. The line of Bulgan spread\nits rule of blood and horror, with heavy taxes, oppression, and dark\nrites. At this time, Tartas Izain became the Taraskon. A sorcerer of\ngreat renown and power, he was relied upon for advice and his control of\nthe populace. Temples to the Silent One were first founded under Tartas'\ninfluence.\n\nThe Bulgan regime lasted until TA 1436, when Bartek Tam, of clan Másra,\nregained the throne. Tartas Izain fled to Chamesra and shortly afterward\nhelped in leading an offensive against Tûl Isra. In the ensuing years,\ngreat battles decimated the towns and villages in the area. In the\nspring of TA 1457, the forces of Chamesra laid siege to Tûl Isra and\ndestroyed a good portion of the city, much of which was not rebuilt. The\nforces of Shuftas Gabar, the sorcerer and ruler of Chamesra, were\neventually forced back to their own city walls. Chamesra resisted her\nfoes for a full two weeks before the warriors and magi of Tûl Isra broke\nthrough their defenses. The city was sacked save for the High Citadel of\nShuftas Gabar, and rumor has it that the power of darkness still guards\nthe fortress.\n\nPeace reigned for almost 100 years, until clan Bulgan carried out a\nbloody coup at Tûl Isra. Once control was cemented in the surrounding\ncountryside, the power of Bulgan spread. Of the six remaining cities,\nall fell to the armies of Tûl Isra with the exception of Tûl Harar.\nLogistics problems and the quality of the Haran navy made the seaport\nvictorious. Plans were laid to conquer this important site while people\nof Sirayn searched for the true heir to the throne.\n\n\nGeography\n\nThe majority of northern Sirayn is covered with sand. Only the scattered\noases and river valleys support human life. The Tarnet Bazain, home of\nclan Másra, is one of two inhabited sites between the Sîresha and Tûl\nPóac to the north. The southern territories are more fertile. Dry water\nchannels and wadis corrugate the land thoughout Greater Harad.\nInfrequent cloudbursts produce flashfloods that roar through these\nbreaks in Kirmlesra, while annual flooding due to runoff from the Tûr\nBetark produces seasonal flow in the gulleys of Chennacatt and Isra.\n\nRegions\n\n-   Isra, portion of lands that slowly rise from the Sîresha river and\n    the Sára Bask to the foothills of the Tûr Betark.\n-   Sára Bask, a vast forest, stretching from the junction of the\n    Sîresha and Sîrsis rivers to the coast of the Bay of Ormal.\n-   Kirmlesra, region comprised of two dissimilar, but equally desolate\n    areas, the Dalad Kirm and the Kirmlesran Hills.\n-   Chennacatt, region that occupies a plateau that extends south from\n    the Sîresha to the Tûr Betark and east to the Bru Isra.\n-   Tûr Betark, this range of mountains is the eastern end of the Yellow\n    Mountains and isolates Sirayn from the lands south.\n\n\nClimate\n\nThe northern desert portions of Chennacatt and Isra (the Haradwaith) are\nvery inospitable. The area is hot, with temperatures rising above one\nhundred degrees during the day, followed by a drop of 30 to 50 degrees\nduring the night. Near the coast and in the fertile areas to the south,\nthe weather is equally hot, but the land is quite arable due to the\nabundance of mountain rainfall and glacial runoff and the presence of\nrivers. The Tûr Betark are very high, over ten thousand feet in height,\nand exhibit a true alpine environment.\n\nThe Sîrani have three basic seasons: Sadayn (“Flood”), Kramask\n(“Planting”), and Bauga (“Water-channels”). Since the climate is dry,\nthe seasons stem primarily from weather profile in the mountain range.\nThe month of Tarsk starts the season of Bauga, when rainfall in the\npeaks of the Tûr Betark begins, and the wadis of Isra and Chennacatt are\ndry no longer. The mountains receive the greatest amount of rain during\nHirain, Tarsas, and Tars, before precipitation wanes again.\n\nIn the month of Magaub, when mountain precipitation is tampering off,\nthe warming temperatures melt glaciars and snowfields melt whose\nmoisture combines with the rainfall to create the annual flooding of the\nSîresha and its tributaries. Thus begins the season of Sadayn. Glacial\nrunoff and snowmelt continue strong through Gerzaud and then taper to\nalmost nothing.\n\nAs the floodwaters recede, rich sediments deposited by the river remain\nto rejuvinate the topsoil, and the planting and growing season, Kramask,\nbegins in the month of Sain.\n\nThe year's twelve months were based originally on the Elven calendar.\nThe Elven month Narwain equates to the Siranean month of Tars, the first\nmonth of the year, set in the winter. The names of the months in Elvish\nare Narwain, Ninui, Gwaeron, Gwirith, Lothron, Nórui, Cerveth, Urui,\nIvanneth, Narbeth, Hithui, and Girithron."

    "title": "Oath of Fëanor",
    "page_id": "4267",
    "text": "The OATH OF FËANOR was an oath taken by Fëanor and his seven sons to\nnon-negotiable enmity against any person who would take a Silmaril or\nkeep it from them. After Morgoth killed Finwe and stole the Silmarilli,\nthis oath became the cause of some of the most terrible and tragic\ncrimes in the history of Arda.\n\n\nHistory\n\nLearning of his father's death at the hands of Morgoth, Fëanor went back\nto Tirion, breaking the exile set by the Valar. At Tirion, Fëanor gave\nan impassioned speech in which he convinced the vast majority of the\nÑoldor to follow him to Middle-earth to wrest the Silmarils back from\nMorgoth and avenge Finwë. At the end of his speech, furious and ever\nprideful, Fëanor swore the dreadful oath to Eru, calling Manwë and Varda\nin witness. This oath saw him pledge, on pain of calling upon himself\nthe Everlasting Darkness, to pursue with violence any who would keep or\nhold a Silmaril from him, no matter who it was, and no matter what the\nreason or circumstance. His seven sons leaped to his side and swore the\noath with him. \n\nFëanor died soon after his return to Middle-Earth but the remaining\noath-takers, his sons, lived on in relative harmony with the Eldar of\nBeleriand, in no small part thanks to the diplomatic skill of Maedhros.\n For the greater part of the First Age, the oath kept the sons of\nFëanor united in one cause: to defeat Morgoth and retrieve the\nSilmarils, for so long as the jewels remained in the hands of the Dark\nLord, they were irretrievable by force. And so the oath slumbered, as by\nfighting Morgoth, even hopelessly, the brothers were still technically\nattempting to fulfill it.\n\nHowever, the terrible dangers of the oath became apparent when Beren and\nLúthien managed to recover one of the jewels from Morgoth. Now that\nthe jewel was no longer in Morgoth's hands, it became possible for the\nbrothers to retrieve it and genuinely fulfill the oath. Beren gave the\nSilmaril to King Thingol of Doriath who had demanded it as a bride-price\nfor his daughter, believing that Beren could not possibly retrieve one.\nWhen the sons of Fëanor learned of this, they demanded its surrender.\nHowever, Thingol was insulted by the demand and had begun to lust for\nthe Silmaril. He refused their request, and Curufin and Celegorm openly\nthreatened to destroy Doriath. This threat was the cause of considerable\nturmoil and resulted in much grief, for Maedhros was attempting at the\ntime to forge a coalition between the various Elven kingdoms to engage\nin a final, decisive strike against Morgoth's power. The threat caused\nThingol to close his borders and send no aid to the military alliance.\nThough the Elves would not have had the power in any circumstance to\noverthrow Morgoth, the loss of Thingol's aid proved detrimental to the\nalliance. After the Elven defeat during Nírnaeth Arnoediad, a series of\nunfortunate events led to the death of King Thingol and the\ndisappearance of Queen Melian, who returned to Valinor in grief. With\nher departure, the Girdle of Melian, which had protected Doriath from\nattack, faded. Beren and Lúthien's son, Dior, was crowned King of\nDoriath. He likewise refused to surrender the jewel, and the brothers\nattacked Doriath and sacked the halls of the Sindar, committing the\nsecond kin-slaying. However, the Silmaril escaped the destruction of\nDoriath and the oath drove the sons onwards. Eventually, they learned\nthat it it had come into the possession of Elwing, who dwelt near the\nmouths of Sirion. They attacked the and slaughtered the defenseless\nexiles of Gondolin and Doriath, committing the third and most terrible\nkin-slaying.\n\nBut the Silmaril escaped them again and was borne by Eärendil into the\nWest. That Silmaril was forever lost to the sons of Fëanor but two more\nremained in the crown of Morgoth. With the complete destruction of the\nElven kingdoms of Beleriand, it seemed impossible that these would ever\nsee the light of day again. However, Eärendil convinced the Valar to\ntake pity on the Elves and Edain under Morgoth's power, and initiated\nthe War of Wrath. This war saw Morgoth's power utterly overthrown, and\nthe two remaining Silmarils were wrested from him. However, most of the\nsons of Fëanor had been slain in battle, and no few of them during the\nkinslayings by their victims. The only brothers to survive the third and\nfinal kinslaying were Maedhros and Maglor. They demanded the Silmarils\nfrom Eönwë, the standard bearer of Manwë, but because of the wicked\ndeeds they had committed in the name of retrieving it, they were denied.\nBy now sick at heart of keeping the dreadful oath, neither particularly\nwanted anything more to do with the Silmarils, and Maglor openly opposed\nattempting to retrieve them. However, Maedhros convinced him to help him\nlay hands upon the jewels, claiming that because of the oath, they\nsimply had no choice. They snuck in to the camp of the victorious Host\nof the West, slew the guard around the jewels, and retrieved them. The\ncamp was roused against them, and they prepared themselves to die\ndefending their claim. But Eönwë simply permitted them to leave\nunharmed. However, due to the terrible deeds committed by the brothers\nin their retrieval of the Silmarils they found they could not handle the\nSilmarils without enduring searing pain. The two brothers parted and in\nhis anguish Maedhros threw himself and his Silmaril into a fiery chasm.\nMaglor on the other hand tossed his Silmaril into the sea and was said\nto wander the coast forever after lamenting his loss and pain.\n\n\nThe Oath\n\nThe Oath itself, as given in _Morgoth's Ring_, is as follows:\n\n “Be he foe or friend, be he foul or clean Brood of Morgoth or bright\nVala, Elda or Maia or Aftercomer, Man yet unborn upon Middle-earth,\nNeither law, nor love, nor league of swords, Dread nor danger, not Doom\nitself Shall defend him from Fëanáro, and Fëanáro’s kin, Whoso hideth or\nhoardeth, or in hand taketh, Finding keepeth or afar casteth A Silmaril.\nThis swear we all… Death we will deal him ere Day’s ending, Woe unto\nworld’s end! Our word hear thou, Eru Allfather! To the everlasting\nDarkness doom us if our deed faileth… On the holy mountain hear in\nwitness and our vow remember, Manwë and Varda!\""

    "page_id": "4885",
    "text": "ECTHELION, or ECTHELION OF THE FOUNTAIN, was a mighty lord of Gondolin\nduring the First Age of Middle-earth, and one of its greatest heroes.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nMost of Ecthelion's early life is unknown but he might have lived in\nAman in Tirion and might have been one of the followers of Fingolfin.He\npassed through the dangerous Helcaraxe and lived. After he survived the\ngrinding ice, he settled in Vinyamar in Nevrast before moving to\nGondolin in FA 116. He later became lord of the house of the fountain.\n\nAredhel's Escort\n\nTwo hundred years after Gondolin was wrought, Ecthelion, Glorfindel and\nEgalmoth, along with the White Lady of the Ñoldor left the Hidden City\ndue to Aredhel's yearning for the freedom she once had in Valinor. Their\norders were to lead her towards Hithlum, where she would meet her elder\nbrother Fingon. When coming upon the Ford of Brithiach, Aredhel ordered\nthem to turn south, for she desired to see the Sons of Fëanor. Thus,\nEcthelion and his companions sought admittance to Doriath, but the\nwardens refused them entrance inside the Girdle of Melian. Having no\nother choice, they took the dangerous road between the haunted valleys\nof Ered Gorgoroth. Near Nan Dungortheb, the Valley of Dreadful Death,\nthe riders were caught in a mesh of shadows and they were lost from\nAredhel. In vain, they sought her afterwards, but the fell offspring of\nUngoliant that dwelt in that place pursued them. Barely escaping alive,\nthe three lords returned to Gondolin without the princess, where they\nwere received in sorrow.\n\nA Lord of Gondolin\n\nIn the year, FA 473 Ecthelion fought alongside Turgon in the battle\nNirnaeth Arnoediad, leading a wing of Gondolin's forces. Upon the defeat\nof the Ñoldor, he defended a flank as Turgon retreated.\n\nTwenty-three years after Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Tuor and Voronwë of\nGondolin traveled towards the Hidden City. After being led by Elemmakil\nthrough the Seven Gates, Ecthelion appeared before them as Warden of the\nGreat Gate.\n\nEcthelion initially denied passage for Tuor but when Tuor made a\nreference towards Ulmo, the Lord of the Waters, Ecthelion eventually\nallowed him entry.\n\n\n\nHe was the leader of the House of the Fountain, one of the Twelve Houses\nof the Gondolindrim. His people were fond of diamonds and silver, their\narray was most beautiful to the sight. In FA 510 during the Fall of\nGondolin, Ecthelion led his house into battle accompanied by the music\nof their flutes and great were the damages caused to the enemy by their\nlong, bright swords.\n\nWarcry of the Eldar\n\nIn the battle over Gondolin, Ecthelion and his forces made their\nentrance from the South part of the city, after previously being held in\nreserve. So terrible was his voice when commanding the drawing of the\nswords and the killings, which followed, that his name became a terror\namong the enemy and a Warcry to the Eldar. Valiantly fighting side by\nside with Tuor and his House of the Wing, they drove away the orcs until\nalmost the Gate was regained. As Dragons reinforced Morgoth's army,\nEcthelion killed three Balrogs and his sword did “hurt to their fire”.\nOutnumbered, they had to retreat. When doing so, Ecthelion's left arm\nwas wounded and his shield fell to earth. Tuor carried him away as they\njoined the remaining leaders in the Square of the King.\n\nIn that place, the great Fountain of the King stood and Ecthelion\nregained his strength by drinking from it. As seven dragons lead the\nenemy's forces towards the Square, the remaining army of Gondolin began\nretreat. All but Ecthelion, who remained near the fountain in a stand,\nwhich was remembered as the most valiant “in all the songs or in any\ntale”. It was there that he faced Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs.\n\nBane of Gothmog\n\n\n\nTuor tried to stand in the way of Gothmog, but he was thrown aside. Then\nEcthelion, fairest of the Ñoldor, but whose face now had the pallor of\ngrey steel, dueled him. Losing his sword due to a wound received he was\nunable to protect himself. Just as Gothmog was about to deliver the\nfinishing blow, Ecthelion jumped and wrapped his legs around the demon,\ndriving the spike of his helmet into Gothmog's body. This caused Gothmog\nto lose his balance, and he, along with Ecthelion, fell into the\nFountain of the King. Gothmog's fire was thus quenched, but Ecthelion\nalso drowned with him and found his death in cool waters, whose lord he\nwas.\n\nLater, a young Eärendil asked about him, saying that he wished Ecthelion\nwere there, “to play to me on his flute, or make me willow whistles!\nPerchance has he gone on ahead?” After he was informed of Ecthelion's\ndeath, he “wept bitterly” and said that he cared no more to see the\nstreets of Gondolin.\n\n\nWeapons\n\nAlthough it was never confirmed, it is largely believed that Ecthelion\nis the original owner of Orcrist. If so, it is interesting due to the\nfact that Orcrist and its mate Glamdring killed the two most famous\nBalrogs of all time - Glamdring later killing Durin's Bane, and Orcrist\nGothmog. If this is true, then it is also curious that all combatants\ndied during the Balrog battle.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThere are three different sources that offer a translation of ECTHELION\nand they all differ substantially.\n\n-   In _The Book of Lost Tales 2_ Appendix, it is said that the name\n    derives from the Quenya _ehtelë_ (“issue of water, spring”), a\n    reference to his title as Lord for the House of the Fountain.\n-   In the etymologies of _The Lost Road and Other Writings_, his name\n    is composed from _ehtë_, (“spear”) and _thela_, (“point”) (of\n    spear). Put together they would translate as “Spear-point” or\n    “Spear-head”.\n-   In _The War of the Jewels_, which seems to be the last matter J.R.R.\n    Tolkien wrote on it, the name is derived from _aeg_, (“sharp”) and\n    _thel_, (“intent, resolve”). This would translate “one of sharp\n    resolve”.\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\n\n\nPerhaps the earliest J.R.R. Tolkien writing, _The Fall of Gondolin_ was\nwritten during a leave of absence from the World War I, in the year\n1916. It is in that story, published posthumously by Christopher Tolkien\nin the volume _The Book of Lost Tales 2_ that Ecthelion first appears.\nThus, he is one of the first characters Tolkien ever created.\n\nHowever, from a chronological point of view, the first account of his\npresence is the chapter _Of Maeglin_ from _The Silmarillion_. The events\ndescribed here took place more than one hundred and fifty years before\nthose of Gondolin's fall. Along with Glorfindel of Gondolin and\nEgalmoth, he was assigned by Turgon as Aredhel's escort on her ill-fated\njourney. Though no name is mentioned, only that “Turgon appointed three\nlords of his household”, an explanatory note in the volume _The War of\nthe Jewels_, chapter called Maeglin, sheds light on the escorts'\nidentities.\n\n\nGallery"

    "text": "The GUARDS OF THE CITADEL, sometimes referred to as the GUARDS OF THE\nTOWER OF GONDOR, were the warriors responsible for guarding the upmost\nlevel of Minas Tirith, especially the courtyard that held the fountain\nand the White Tree of Gondor, and gave way the thronehall.\n\nThey served as personal bodyguards to the Kings of Gondor, and later to\nthe Stewards of Gondor until King Aragorn II Elessar's coronation.\n\nThey were mainly a stationary guard unit, rather than a mobile force,\nthough were sometimes seen acting as a mobile guard when travelling with\nthe Steward. They were headed by a Captain of the Citadel, who was\nchosen by the Steward from nobility or high military ranks. As a whole,\nthey were considered to be the best soldiers in the realm of Gondor.\nKnown for their bravery, fighting skills, and unshakable loyalty, they\nswear an oath against their own lives to serve their lord.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Tower Guards saw little combat during the War of the Ring. Though\nthe city burned around them and the air swarmed with Fell Beasts at the\nSiege of Gondor, they remained at their posts, guarding their Steward\nand the White Tree all throughout the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.\n\nWhen Peregrin Took arrived with Gandalf the White in Minas Tirith, he\noffered his services as payment for Boromir's sacrifice to save his\nlife. He was outfitted in the garb of the Tower, and was instructed by\nBeregond of the Third Company, though did not join the normal ranks, and\nacted as personal esquire to the Steward Denethor. Peregrin was the only\nGuard to leave the Citadel during the Battle of Pelennor Fields, fleeing\nto the city gates to fetch Gandalf to save Faramir from Denethor's\nmadness. Beregond as well left his post and killed a fellow, breaking\nhis oath and losing his position as a member of the Guard, in order to\nkeep the fires from Faramir until Gandalf's arrival.\n\nAfter the battle, at least some of the Tower Guards left the city,\njoining the company of King Elessar as he journeyed to the Black Gate of\nMordor.\n\nKnown members\n\n-   Beregond\n-   Boromir (Captain during the War of the Ring until death at Amon Hen)\n-   Peregrin Took (Under service of the steward Denethor II)\n\n\nEquipment\n\nThe Citadel Guards wore similar armor to that of ordinary knights of\nGondor, though finer crafted – believed by some to be a gift of the\nDwarves to Gondor in an earlier time.\n\nIn the book they are described as wearing a uniform of black robes and\nblack surcoats, embroidered in white with a tree in blossom under a\nsilver crown and many-pointed stars. Their helms were high-crowned and\npointed, with long cheek-guards fitting to the face, and above these\nwere set the white wings of sea-birds to honor their seafaring\nNúmenórean heritage; the helms were Mithril and heirlooms from ancient\ntimes. They carried swords for close combat.\n\nAs an esquire, Peregrin Took wore mail forged of black steel, a helm\nwith raven-wings and a silver star in the center above the forehead, and\na black surcoat with the device of the White Tree sewn in silver. He\nbore a short sword from the Barrow-downs.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film trilogy\n\nIn and only in Peter Jackson's 3rd film _The Return of the King_, there\nare two different Guard variations. Guards of the Fountain shown guard\nthe White Tree, and there are only four of them shown at any given time.\nThe actual 'Citadel Guards' appear occasionally in the background, in\nFaramir's Osgiliath flashback guarding Denethor, and when Denethor\nattempts to burn Faramir.\n\nAppearance\n\nIn the film adaptation, the Fountain Guards stationed in the Fountain\nCourt itself wore black capes that concealed most of their armor, and\nblack cloths over the lower halves of their faces. The Citadel guards\nwore normal Gondor armor, but with small wings attached flush to the\nhelmet.\n\nVideo games\n\n-   They appear in the game _The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for\n    Middle-earth_ as Gondor's spear-carrying class.\n-   They return in _The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth\n    II_ as the Men of the West faction's pikemen class, and in _The Rise\n    of the Witch-king_ expansion-pack, the elite pikemen for Men of the\n    West. They can only be created from a rank 2 Gondor Barracks and\n    cost more to recruit than normal soldiers. Their formation is\n    interchangeable between their default line formation and a dense\n    “shield wall” formation, where they gain 80% armor but lose 75%\n    speed. See Citadel Guards.\n\n    Berethor is a member of the Citadel Guards in both ''The Lord of the\n    Rings: The Third Age ''and _Battle for Middle-Earth_ series.\n\n-   The _Order of the Tower Guard_ is a lore-based kinship in _Lord of\n    the Rings: Online_ on the Landroval server; the Guard of the Citadel\n    form the kernal of lore for the guild, who function as a mobile\n    entity of the Guard.  Lore focuses on the mysteries of the White\n    Trees of Gondor and the transition of the Third Age to the Fourth\n    Age, and has its roots in the Elven stewardship of Celeborn at Tol\n    Eressëa."

    "title": "Dagor Dagorath",
    "page_id": "5728",
    "text": "The DAGOR DAGORATH or “FINAL BATTLE” is the end-times event described\nand alluded to in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. The published\n_Silmarillion_ ends with the recounting of the voyage of Eärendil the\nMariner, but this is due to an editorial decision by Christopher\nTolkien. The _Silmarillion_ as Tolkien originally wrote it ends with a\nprophecy by Mandos about the Dagor Dagorath, often referred to as “THE\nEND”. The remaining clue to this prophecy is found at the end of\nAkallabêth, where \"Ar-Pharazôn and his mortal warriors who had set foot\nin Aman were buried by falling hills, imprisoned in the Caves of the\nForgotten until the “LAST BATTLE AND DAY OF DOOM”. The account is\nclearly inspired by and bears many similarities to the Norse legend of\nRagnarök, but also that of the Biblical Armageddon. It is important to\nnote that the final, published version of the ''Silmarillion ''contains\nno direct references to this prophecy (though there are still indirect\nreferences including the 'Last Battle', 'Day of Doom' and 'end of\ndays'.\n\nTom Bombadil once referred to this future time as when “the world is\nmended”, in a song.\n\nDoom of Melkor\n\nIn later writings of Tolkien's, it becomes apparent that Melkor was not\nmerely bound, but unhoused, after his final capture, being “beheaded”\nand thus “killed”; that is, the body to which he had become so bound\ntowards was destroyed, after which execution his spirit, still bound\nwith the enchanted chain Angainor, was cast out through the Door of\nNight. His “will” is spoken of as an active force in the world, tempting\nand urging in thought, and sometimes in phantom manifestation.\n\nThe Second Prophecy of Mandos\n\n“Thus spoke Mandos in prophecy, when the Valar sat in judgement in\nValinor and the rumour of his word was whispered among all the Elves of\nthe West. When the world is old and the Powers have grown weary,\nMorgoth, the Black Foe of the World, seeing that the guard sleepeth,\nshall come back through the Door of the Night out of the Timeless Void;\nand all shall be darkness, for the sun he will turn to black, and the\nmoon will no longer shed his light.. But the Host of Valinor shall\ndescend upon him as a searing flame, white and terrible. Then shall the\nLast Battle be gathered on the fields of Valinor. In that day, Tulkas\nshall strive with Morgoth, and on his right hand shall be Eönwë, and on\nhis left Túrin Turambar, son of Húrin, returning from the Doom of Men at\nthe ending of the world; and the black sword of Túrin shall deal unto\nMorgoth his death and final end; and so shall the Children of Húrin and\nall fallen Men be avenged.”\n\n“Thereafter shall the Earth be broken and remade, and the Silmarils\nshall be recovered out of Air and Earth and Sea; for Feanor shall\nsurrender them willingly Yavanna will rekindle the Two Trees, and a\ngreat light shall come forth. And the mountains of Valinor shall be\nlevelled, so that the light shall go out over all the world. In that\nlight the Valar will grow young again, and the Elves awake and all their\ndead arise, and the purpose of Ilúvatar be fulfilled concerning them.\nBut of Men in that day the prophecy of Mandos doth not speak, and no Man\nit names, save Túrin only, and to him a place is given among the sons of\nthe Valar.” - The Later Quenta Silmarillion (History of Middle-earth,\nvolume 11).\n\nBattle\n\nAccording to the prophecy, Morgoth will discover how to break the Door\nof Night, and will blacken the Sun and the Moon. For the love of these,\nEärendil will return from the sky and shall meet Tulkas, Manwë, Eönwë\n(with the old version of his name Fionwe) and Túrin Turambar on the\nplains of Valinor.  There the\nforces of the Valar shall fight against Melkor and The Dark Powers.\nTulkas will wrestle with Morgoth, but it will be by the hand of Túrin\nthat finally death and destruction will be dealt to Melkor. Túrin will\nrun his black sword Gurthang (Iron of Death) through Melkor's heart,\nthus avenging the Children of Húrin (Sindarin: _Hîn Húrin_) and all the\nfallen (In the end of _The Hiding of Valinor_ Eönwë, and not Turin,\nkills Morgoth). Then the three Silmarils will be recovered from the\nEarth, sea, and sky, then Fëanor taking them and will break, and with\ntheir fire Yavanna will rekindle the Two Trees, and a great light shall\ncome forth, and Pelóri Mountains will be leveled. The battle will end\nand renew Arda's existence: all the Elves will awaken and the Powers\nwill be young again.\n\nFollowing this, there will be a Second Music of the Ainur. This song\nwill sing into being a new world. Men and Elves will sing it with the\nAinur. It is unknown what the fate of the old races, or of the old\nworld, will be in the new one. However, It is worth noting that the\nDwarves believe that after the greatest battle of all time, they will\nhelp the Vala, Mahal, rebuild Arda. For though Mandos prophesied it,\neven the Ainur do not know anything of the second world or the Second\nMusic. All the Ainur know is that the Second Music will be greater than\nthe First Music.\n\n\nNotes\n\nChristopher Tolkien removed the prophecy from _The Silmarillion_ based\non a 1958 version of the Valaquenta, wherein his father wrote that none\nof Mandos' dooms had declared whether the Marring of Arda would ever be\nrepaired (Christopher Tolkien adopted this passage and used it to close\nthe Quenta Silmarillion). Given this removal of the prophecy Christopher\napparently assumed that the Dagor Dagorath had been removed as well.\n\nThe published _Silmarillion_ contradicts the Second Prophecy in places.\nWhereas the Second Prophecy explicitly states that the Elves and Valar\nshall be renewed after Dagor Dagorath and that the fate of Men is\nunknown, _The Silmarillion_ states that Men will participate in singing\nthe Second Music, and that it is the fate of the Elves that is unknown.\n\nIn all of this the Creator, Eru, will retain His sovereignty and nothing\nMorgoth nor any evil force could do will be able to threaten his plan in\nany way. As Eru said, “And thou, Melkor, shalt see that no theme may be\nplayed that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the\nmusic in my despite. For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine\ninstrument in the devising of things more wonderful, which he himself\nhath not imagined.”\n\n\nEtymology\n\n_Dagor Dagorath_ was Sindarin for “Battle of Battles”."

    "title": "Goblins",
    "page_id": "6015",
    "text": "“GOBLINS” are what Tolkien called the ORCS whom Thorin and Company\nencountered in _The Hobbit._ They lived deep under the Misty Mountains\nin many strongholds, ever since the War of Wrath in the First Age.\nTolkien described them as big, ugly creatures, “cruel, wicked, and\nbad-hearted.” Tolkien explained in a note at the start of _The Hobbit_\nthat he was using English to represent the languages used by the\ncharacters, and that _goblin_ (or _hobgoblin_ for the larger kind) was\nthe English translation he was using for the word _Orc,_ which (he\nwrote) is the hobbits' form of the name for them. Tolkien used the term\n_goblin_ extensively in _The Hobbit_, and also occasionally in _The Lord\nof the Rings,_ as when the Uruk-hai of Isengard are first described:\n“four goblin-soldiers of greater stature”.\n\nA clear illustration that Tolkien considered goblins and orcs to be the\nsame thing, the former word merely being the English translation of the\nlatter, is that in _The Hobbit_ (the only one of Tolkien's works in\nwhich he usually refers to orcs as _goblins_) Gandalf asks Thorin if he\nremembers Azog the goblin who killed his grandfather Thror , while in\nall his other writings Tolkien describes Azog as a “great Orc”.\n\n\nHistory and Description\n\n\n\nWhen Melkor was taken in chains to Valinor, the Orcs and other foul\ncreatures were forced to flee from Angband. Their kingdoms spread\nthroughout many mountains of Middle-earth; notable cities include\nGoblin-town near the High Pass above Rivendell, the Goblin-capital at\nMount Gundabad, and the former Dwarf-kingdom of Moria, as well as those\nin the service of Isengard and Mordor.\n\n\nTechnology\n\nEven though goblins are portrayed as a very barbaric and tribal race\ntheir technology seems to be more advanced than other races in middle\nearth. In _The Hobbit_, Tolkien describes goblins as having dark\ntechnology. In the chapter “Over Hill and Under Hill” Tolkien states,\n“It is not unlikely that they invented some of the machines that have\nsince troubled the world, especially the ingenious devices for killing\nlarge numbers of people at once, for wheels and engines and explosives\nalways delighted them.”\n\n\nWeapons and armor\n\n\n\nGoblin weapons include scimitars, axes, and spears, as well as bows. The\ngreat goblin-soldiers of Isengard, the “fighting Uruk-hai”, are\ndistinguished by their use of short, straight swords and long bows of\nyew.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nIn popular parlance, perhaps because the word _goblins_ was used in _The\nHobbit_ (which was in many ways essentially a children's book) whereas\norcs came across as more fearsome in Tolkien's later works, it has\nbecome common for many to distinguish goblins as different from orcs:\nsmaller and less fearsome, and less socially evolved. This idea has\ngained currency through its widespread adoption in various adaptations\nof Tolkien's stories, as well as in many derivative fantasy worlds,\nincluding novels, movies, and games such as _Dungeons & Dragons_.\n\nThe Hobbit (1977 film)\n\n\n\nThe animated Goblins appearing in this film are large, putrid green,\nbestial creatures. They are far bulkier than what one normally expects\nfor a Goblin, being either hugely muscular or fat. They also had bulbous\ntoad-like heads featuring tusks, lupine ears, canine-like noses, and\neven horns.\n\nThe Return of the King (1980 film)\n\nThis 1980 animated adaptation attempted to explain to viewers the\nidentification of _goblins_ with _orcs_. Early in the movie, Sam is\nheard thinking, “Orcs in the tower. Old Bilbo called them goblins.\nWhatever the name, I loathe the vile creatures.” The Goblins/Orcs in\nthis film use much the same design as those seen in The Hobbit, but with\nmore variations in shape and size, and a more bluish skin tone.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film trilogy\n\n\n\nIn the Peter Jackson movie _The Fellowship of the Ring_ (2001), the\nGoblins have overrun the dwarven colony in Moria long before the events\nof the movie. When the Fellowship passes through the abandoned Dwarf\ncity of Dwarrowdelf, Pippin accidentally alerts the Goblins to their\npresence, causing a fight to break out in Balin's Tomb. In this\ninstance, their main weapon appears to be a Cave Troll, which has to be\nbrought down by the whole Fellowship, but the entire force is wiped out\nby the end of the battle.\n\nHowever, the skirmish allows a much larger force of Goblins to close in\non the Fellowship, who flee to the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. Unfortunately\nfor them, even more Goblins intercept them in one of Dwarrowdelf's great\nhalls, emerging from cracks in the floor and holes in the ceiling to aid\ntheir comrades. Trapped in a sea of Goblins, the Fellowship could only\nprepare for death, but the evil creatures suddenly paused as a menacing\nroar echoed in the distance. As a distant hall lit with a fiery orange\nglow, the Goblins inexplicably fled in all directions, leaving the\nFellowship to wonder at their fortune — as well as at what was coming\nnext: Durin's Bane. In the book, Orcs are more effective fighters than\nin the film adaptation. It was an Orc chieftain who stabbed Frodo in the\noriginal story, rather than the Cave Troll shown in the movie, and Sam\nwas also injured by another Orc. Haldir tells the Fellowship that Orcs\nwill pursue enemies for long distances, even during the day, to avenge\nthe death of a chieftain.\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\n\n\nThe Moria Orcs seen in the film seem to be larger and bulkier, towering\nover dwarves butt smaller than men. The Goblins of the High Pass seen in\nPeter Jackson's first installment of the Hobbit trilogy are quite\ndifferent compared to the Orcs of Moria, having flesh-toned skin and\nriddled with various skin diseases and deformations like harelips,\nmismatched or skewed eyes, and crooked-growing fingernails. They are\noverall much more grotesque than Goblins seen in the _Lord of the Rings_\ntrilogy, being as tall as any Dwarf or Hobbit or some reaching to almost\nhuman height or even greater. These types of goblins later appear in\n_The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_ as “goblin mercenaries”\nadorned in armor and some riding Great Guldur War Trolls.\n\n\nAppearance\n\n In the Hobbit, Tolkien describes\norcs as a large variety of goblins, leading to the idea that goblins\nwere of smaller build than orcs, although “The Great Goblin” and “Azog\nthe Goblin” (as they were called in _The Hobbit_) were massive in size.\n\nIn Peter Jackson's films, being of the same stature as dwarves and\nhobbits, the goblins are depicted in appearing to lead a much more\ntribal life compared to the orcs, often having a chief among smaller\ngroups. Compared to orcs, goblins are less organized and use a vast\nrange of scavenged items of clothing, armour and weaponry. They also\nhave a fear of light and the sun and will not step out in daylight most\nof the time.  There are two varieties of goblins: The\ngoblins of the Misty Mountain and the goblins of Moria. The goblins of\nthe Misty Mountain have flesh-colored skin and seem to be afflicted with\nvarious skin diseases and deformations that include hairlips and stunted\ngrowth. The goblins of Moria have a very green-colored skin tone\ncompared to their Misty Mountain cousins with larger pointier ears and\nhuge bulbous eyes that reflect their nature as cave creatures."

    "page_id": "6074",
    "text": "TOM BOMBADIL'S SONGS are in the index of The Lord of the Rings, all\nlisted as one continuous song. The first part is what Frodo Baggins and\nSam Gamgee hear while Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took are stuck in\nOld Man Willow in the Old Forest:\n\n    _Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo!_\n    _Ring a dong! hop along! Fal lal the willow!_\n    _Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo!_\n\n1. The hobbits then hear a string of apparently nonsense-words followed\nby:\n\n    _Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My darling!_\n    _Light goes the weather-wind and the feathered starling._\n    _Down along under Hill, shining in the sunlight,_\n    _Waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight,_\n    _There my pretty lady is, River-woman's daughter,_\n    _Slender as the willow-wand, clearer than the water._\n    _Old Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringing_\n    _Comes hopping home again. Can you hear him singing?_\n    _Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! and merry-o!_\n    _Goldberry__, Goldberry, merry yellow berry-o!_\n    _Poor old Willow-man, you tuck your roots away!_\n    _Tom's in a hurry now. Evening will follow day._\n    _Tom's going home again water-lilies bringing._\n    _Hey! Come derry dol! Can you hear me singing?_\n\n2. After Tom has freed Merry and Pippin, he goes on ahead to his house,\noutdistancing the hobbits. He sings this back to them:\n\n    _Hop along, my little friends, up the Withywindle!_\n    _Tom's going on ahead candles for to kindle._\n    _Down west sinks the Sun: soon you will be groping._\n    _When the night-shadows fall, then the door will open,_\n    _Out of the window-panes light will twinkle yellow._\n    _Fear no alder black! Heed no hoary willow!_\n    _Fear neighter root nor bough! Tom goes on before you._\n    _Hey now! merry dol! We'll be waiting for you!_\n\n3. Once the hobbits can see the house, they hear:\n\n    _Hey! Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties!_\n    _Hobbits! Ponies all! We are fond of parties._\n    _Now let the fun begin! Let us sing together!_\n\n4. At this point, Goldberry joins in with:\n\n    _Now let the song begin! Let us sing together!_\n    _Of sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather,_\n    _Light on the budding leaf, dew on the feather,_\n    _Wind on the open hill, bells on the heather,_\n    _Reeds by the shady pool, lilies on the water:_\n    _Old  Tom Bombadil and the River-daughter!_\n\n5. While Tom is taking care of the ponies, he sings:\n\n    _Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow;_\n    _Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow._\n\n6. After supper, Tom explains why he was down by Old Man Willow:\n\n    _I had an errand there: gathering water-lilies,_\n    _green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady,_\n    _the last ere the year's end to keep them from the winter,_\n    _to flower by her pretty feet till the snows are melted._\n    _Each year at summer's end I go to find them for her,_\n    _in a wide pool, deep and clear, far down the Withywindle;_\n    _there they open first in spring and there they linger latest._\n    _By that pool long ago I found the River-daughter,_\n    _fair young Goldberry sitting in the rushes._\n    _Sweet was her singing then, and her heart was beating!_\n    _And that proved well for you-- for now I shall no longer_\n    _go down deep again along the forest-water,_\n    _not while the year is old. Nor shall I be passing_\n    _Old Man Willow's house this side of spring-time,_\n    _not till the merry spring, when the River-daughter_\n    _dances down the withy-path to bathe in the water._\n\n7. Tom teaches the hobbits what to sing if they get into trouble:\n\n    _Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!_\n    _By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,_\n    _By fire, sun and moon, hearken now and hear us!_\n    _Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!_\n\n8. After Frodo calls out the lines above, he hears Tom Bombadil singing\nthe following:\n\n    _Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow,_\n    _Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow._\n    _None has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is the master:_\n    _His songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster._\n\n9. Tom sings a sort of exorcism to banish the Barrow-wight:\n\n    _Get out, you old wight! Vanish in the sunlight!_\n    _Shrivel like the cold mist, like the winds go wailing,_\n    _Out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains!_\n    _Come never here again! Leave your barrow empty!_\n    _Lost and forgotten be, darker than the darkness,_\n    _Where gates stand for ever shut, till the world is mended._\n\n10. In order to revive Merry, Pippin, and Sam after getting them out of\nthe barrow, Tom chants:\n\n    _Wake now my merry lads! Wake and hear me calling!_\n    _Warm now be heart and limb! The cold stone is fallen;_\n    _Dark door is standing wide; dead hand is broken._\n    _Night under Night is flown, and the Gate is open!_\n\n11. Tom Bombadil then goes looking for the hobbits' ponies, calling:\n\n    _Hey! now! Come hoy now! Wither do you wander?_\n    _Up, down, near or far, here, there or yonder?_\n    _Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail and Bumpkin,_\n    _White-socks my little lad, and old Fatty Lumpkin!_\n\n12. Once Tom has led the hobbits to the Road, he declines to accompany\nthem further, saying:\n\n    _Tom's country ends here: he will not pass the borders._\n    _Tom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting!_\n\nit:Aiuto Tom Bombadil!"

    "title": "Finn and Hengest",
    "page_id": "6902",
    "text": "FINN AND HENGEST is a study by J.R.R Tolkien, edited by Alan Bliss and\npublished posthumously in book form in\n1982.\n\nIt is not a work of Middle-earth canon.\n\n\nAbout\n\nFinn and Hengest are two Anglo-Saxon heroes appearing in the Old English\nepic poem _Beowulf_ and in the fragment of “The Fight at Finnsburg”.\nHengest has sometimes been identified with the Jutish king of Kent. He\nand his brother Horsa (the names meaning “stallion” and “horse”) were\nthe legendary leaders of the first Anglo-Saxon immigrants to Britain as\nmercenaries in the 5th century).\n\nThe book is based on an edited series of lectures Tolkien made before\nand after World War II. In his lectures, Tolkien argued that the Hengest\nof “The Fight at Finnsburg” and of _Beowulf_ was an historical rather\nthan a legendary figure and that these works record episodes from an\norally composed and transmitted history of the Hengest named in the\n“Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.” This view has gained acceptance from a number\nof medieval historian and Anglo-Saxon scholars both since Tolkien's\ninitial lectures and since the publication of this posthumous\ncollection.\n\nTolkien's lectures describe what he called the “Jutes-on-both-sides\ntheory”, which was his explanation for the puzzling occurrence of the\nword ēotenas in the episode in _Beowulf_. Tolkien read the word as\nJutes, and theorized that the fight was a purely Jutish feud, and Finn\nand Hnæf were simply caught up by circumstance. Tolkien explained both\ntheir presence and their ambiguous loyalty with his following\ninterpretation of the story.\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nHnæf, son of Hoc Half-Dane, is the lord of a Danish people who have\nconquered part of Jutland (probably the northern part of the Cimbrian\npeninsula) and exiled its former Jutish rulers. Finn, king of Frys-Land\n(modern-day Friesland in the Netherlands) has allowed dispossessed Jutes\nto settle in his lands and enter his service. Finn marries Hnæf's older\nsister Hildeburh, and sends their son (whose name was probably\nFriðuwulf) to be fostered in Hnæf's household.\n\nAround the year AD 450, Hnæf sails to Frys-Land in the autumn; his\npurpose is to return Finn's now-grown son and spend the winter in Finn's\ncitadel, celebrating Yule. He brings a retinue of some sixty thanes.\nChief among these thanes is a Jute named Hengest, leader of a band of\nJutes who have taken service under Hnæf. Unfortunately, and foreseen by\nno one, when they arrive at Finn's stronghold they find that many of\nFinn's thanes are also Jutes, particularly one Garulf, who seems to be\nthe rightful heir to the kingdom conquered by Hnæf's people; and these\nFrisian Jutes are at blood feud with Hengest and his band, because\nHengest supports the conquering Danes, if for no other reason. This\nwould explain why Hildeburh “had no cause to praise the fealty of the\nJutes,” since that fealty led to the re-awakening of the feud, which\nkilled her brother, husband, and son.\n\nFinn (who seems guiltless in Tolkien's interpretation) tries to prevent\ntrouble by separating the parties, and allowing Hnæf and his thanes to\noccupy the royal hall, while he removes his own thanes to a different\nbuilding. However, the Frisian Jutes make a pre-dawn attack, hoping to\ntake Hengest and his band by surprise. But the Danes have been expecting\ntrouble, and a watchman sees the light of their approaching torches. He\nasks rhetorically, “What is this light? Is it the dawn in the East, or\nis it the flight of a dragon, or are the gables burning?” Hnæf answers,\n“Neither is this the dawn in the East, nor is it the flight of a dragon,\nnor are the gables of this hall burning,” it is an attack. Prepared, the\nDanes and Hengest's Jutes barricade the two doors of the hall against\nattack. Garulf is warned by one Guðhere not to risk his “precious life”\nin the assault, but he attacks and is the first to fall. Finn's Frisian\nthanes, who have ties of marriage and friendship to Finn's Jutish\nthanes, join in the fight against the Danes. The Danes hold the hall for\nfive days without losing a man. On the morning of the fifth day the\nFrisians force their way into the hall, and in the battle, both Hnæf and\nFriðiwulf are killed. (It is not clear which side Friðiwulf was fighting\non, but Tolkien thinks it likely he was staying in the hall with Hnæf,\nhis foster-father and uncle; this would explain why Beowulf emphasizes\nthat Friðiwulf was laid on the funeral pyre at Hnæf's side.) The\nsurviving Danes and Hengest's Jutes drive the Frisians and Jutes out of\nthe hall and re-barricade the door.\n\nAt this point Finn (who may not have joined in the fight personally)\nintervenes and offers to make a bargain with the survivors. As Tolkien\npoints out, the Danes had several advantages:\n\n1) Finn had lost so many men that he could not force his way into the\nhall again. 2) The Danes were occupying his royal hall, and he was\nunwilling to burn it to get them out. 3) Finn must have felt both guilty\nand ashamed that his feuding thanes had killed Hnæf, who was his\nbrother-in-law and guest. Inside the hall, the survivors are in two\ngroups: Danes, led by a chief thane who is described as Hunlafing (“the\nson of Hunlaf”) and Jutes, led by Hengest. The Jutes are Hengest's own\nband, and owed loyalty to Hnæf only because Hengest followed him. Finn\nat first tries to make peace with the Danes only, but the Danes loyally\ninsist that any peace agreement must include Hengest and his men. Finn\nagrees, and swears an oath of peace: the Danes and Hengest's men will\nlay down their arms, and since they cannot leave Frys-Land until the\nwinter ends, they will sit at Finn's table and technically accept him as\ntheir protector (since he was now their only possible source of food and\nmaintenance, and they had intended to be his guests throughout the\nwinter anyway.) Finn gives the Danes a separate hall to dwell in for the\nwinter, specifying that they shall share it with the sons of the Jutes\n(meaning Hengest and his band.) He also swears that any one of his own\nthanes who tries to renew the feud (by taunting the Danes that they now\nfollow the slayer of their lord) will be punished, possibly with death,\nby Finn himself. The bodies of Hnæf and Friðiwulf are honorably burned.\n\nOver the winter, the Danes and their Jutish allies brood over the fall\nof Hnæf. Hengest is faced with a conflict of duty: whether to honor the\npeace-treaty with Finn, or to honor his duty to avenge his fallen lord.\nFinally the son of Hunlaf takes a sword Hildeleoma (“Battleflame”) which\nwas probably Hnæf's sword, and lays it in Hengest's lap. Hengest “does\nnot refuse the world's counsel” (that is, he goes along with what\neveryone agrees is right) and decides that his loyalty to Hnæf must\noutweigh his obligation to Finn. (In any case, Tolkien points out that\nwe do not see Hengest swearing any oath to Finn; we only see Finn\nswearing oaths to Hengest and the Danes.) When the spring comes, the\nDanes sail home and tell the story of the downfall of Hnæf. They return\nto Finn's stronghold in force. Hengest, having remained in Frys-Land\nunder the guise of upholding the terms of the peace-treaty, opens the\ngates to the invaders and the Danes sack Finn's stronghold, kill Finn\nand all his men, loot and burn the city and return home, taking\nHildeburh with them."

    "title": "Lake-town",
    "page_id": "7514",
    "text": "_'Lake-town, OR Esgaroth_', known fully as “ESGAROTH UPON THE LONG\nLAKE”, was a small settlement and community of Men in the north-western\npart of the Long Lake in the Rhovanion. The town was constructed\nentirely of wood and stands upon wooden pillars sunk into the bed of the\nLong Lake, south of the Lonely Mountain and east of Mirkwood. It seems\nthat the town's prosperity was built on trade between the Men, Elves and\nDwarves of northern Middle-earth.\n\nIt was also known as the final resting place of the Dragon Smaug, whose\nbones ended up at the bottom of the lake, and by whom it was destroyed.\n\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nLake-town may have been separate settlements established on the same\nsite, one predating Smaug's destruction of Dale and the Lonely Mountain\nin TA 2770 and the other built afterwards. Uniquely, of all of the\ntowns, settlements, fortresses, and cities of Middle-earth, Lake-town\nutilized water as its defense. The Long Lake was also surrounded by\ntowering cliffs and high mountains, all helpful natural barriers that\nhad the potential to aid its defenders in a siege (such as the\nEasterling invasion of the North in TA 3018). While these defenses\nslowed and diverted Lake-town's human enemies, it did nothing to prepare\nits inhabitants against Smaug. The villagers would be harassed on a\nregular basis by Smaug. Smaug would steal an occasional maiden or just\nburn down their homes.\n\nLake-town was founded sometime during the Third Age and its inhabitants\ntraded extensively with the Elves of Thranduil's Woodland Realm, the\nDwarves of the Lonely Mountain and the Iron Hills, their kin in Dale and\nDorwinion to the south, and possibly with the Easterlings (in times of\npeace, of course). The Men of Lake-town traded with Dorwinion (a human\nrealm on the fertile coastal plain on the west shore of the Sea of Rhûn)\nin a unique way; wine barrels were floated down from Thranduil's caverns\nin Mirkwood (the Elves were known as copious wine drinkers, as found in\nthe Hobbit) along the Celduin down to Lake-town, where they were\nredirected to Dorwinion. The wine was then paid for and filled with the\nnecessary goods before being shipped back north, and the cycle of trade\nresumed once more. These barrels were also quite large, for they could\nfit a Hobbit or Dwarf (even the extremely fat Bombur).\n\n\n\nIt is also where Bilbo and the Dwarves travelled in their adventure to\nreclaim the Lonely Mountain. In the year TA 2941 of the Third Age the\ntown was attacked by the dragon, but Bard the Bowman, who had indirectly\nlearned of a weakness in Smaug's armor that had first been noticed by\nBilbo Baggins, slew the dragon. Smaug, livid\nwith bestial fury, had winged his way to the town in the dead of night\nand promptly began to immolate the wooden matchwood structures there,\nmaterials that burst into flame at the slightest provocation. Its\ninhabitants realized all too late their predicament and while some,\nincluding most of the women and children, got away safely on boats, many\nperished in the maelstrom of fire that ensued. A brave company of\nspearmen and archers attempted, in vain, to shoot down the dragon, but\nwere mostly immolated themselves. It wasn't until Bard managed to kill\nthe dragon, that the destruction finally ended. The town was wrecked by\nthe dragon, but afterwards it was rebuilt using some of the treasure\nthat Smaug had stolen, though the town's Master ran off with some of the\nGold. Part of the town's population followed Bard to resettle the\nKingdom of Dale.\n\nAs trading people, the Men of Lake-town knew the Common Speech, Westron.\nHowever, amongst themselves they spoke an ancient form of it, which was\nloosely related to but distinct from the also ancient language of the\nRohirrim. Tolkien “translated” Westron into English in his text, so to\nrepresent its ancient relative that the Rohirrim spoke he substituted\nOld English. Thus, Tolkien substituted Old Norse for the language of the\nMen of Esgaroth (in person and place names, etc.) because it is an\nancient relative of English that is related to Old English.\n\nAfter the town's near destruction following Smaug's rage, its\ninhabitants rebuilt it with more splendor and grandeur further down the\nlake. LAKE-TOWN is used to refer to the pre-Smaug town upon the Long\nLake, while the rebuilt, larger cousin further down the waterway is\nreferred to as ESGAROTH. The inhabitants also learned a crucially\nimportant, but painful, lesson bought with the blood of loved ones: the\ntown was built to be less susceptible to flame and its military was\nexpanded. These lessons greatly aided it during the War of the Ring.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\nIn Peter Jackson's _The Hobbit_ movie trilogy, the clear Eastern design\nand culture of Lake-town and its inhabitants (including, the military\nand political leaders) are primarily derived from medieval Russian\ninfluences - i.e., the early Rus' states of Kievan Rus' and its\nsuccessors. Indeed, Lake-town is reminiscent of the old northern Rus'\ntrading city of Novgorod - itself, like Lake-town, also situated on a\nlake.\n\nAlso, as presented in the movies, per the complex nature of Russian\nethno-cultural history, Lake-town itself and its people are also infused\nwith Finnic, Baltic, and Turkic influences. In the movies, Peter Jackson\nclearly defines the culture of Lake-town and Dale as a part of the East.\nDue to the location of Lake-town in the North-East of Middle-earth,\nthese elements are highly appropriate.\n\n\nGallery"

    "title": "Gift of Men",
    "page_id": "7687",
    "text": "The GIFT OF MEN refers to a gift of Ilúvatar to his Younger Children,\nwhich remains a source of some confusion for Tolkien enthusiasts. The\nconcept includes both mortality, leading to death of old age, and free\nwill. Below are two interpretations of the nature and extent of the Gift\nof Men as articulated by Tolkien.\n\n\nA spiritual/theological view of the Gift of Men\n\nThe _Gift of Men_ was an act of the Supreme Being Ilúvatar that set the\nrace of Men apart from the Elves. While the race of Elves would know the\nmost bliss and contentment and would conceive more beauty than any\nothers of the Children of Ilúvatar, it was decreed by this gift that Men\nwould be the prime instruments of Ilúvatar within Arda.\n\nIlúvatar willed that the spirits/hearts of Men are not content within\nArda, and find no rest therein, and therefore seek beyond the world and\nits confines. They are not bound to the Circles of the World, as the\nElves and all other creatures of Arda are bound to the Earth. The\nspirits of Men truly leave the physical world, and do not return. Thus\ntheir fates are completely sundered from that of the Elves, who do not\ndie until the world dies, unless slain by violence or ill chance, or by\nwearying at the last of the passage of centuries. But as the years grow\nlong and Time wears, even the Valar will come to envy the gift of\nIlúvatar to the race of Men, that of liberation from the physical world,\nand the inevitability of loss and sorrows that must come with this\nexistence within Arda.\n\nMoreover, it is also a consequence of this true spiritual freedom of not\nbeing bound to either the ordinance of Fate, or the confines of the\nWorld that the spirits of Men do not dwell long in Arda, and after what\nseems to be a very short time to the immortal Elves, men age, grow\nweary, and die.\n\nHowever, a key aspect of this gift of living within Arda for a short\ntime was a virtue instilled into the race of Men to be motivated to\ncreate destinies for themselves amidst the powers and chances of the\nworld. Men were able to shape their lives _beyond_ the Music of the\nAinur, which rules the fates of all other things in Arda. Men may choose\nto live in tune with the themes of the Music that created Arda, or be\nindifferent to it, or live in defiance of it.\n\nIlúvatar understood that Men would not always use this gift of freedom\nin harmony with the world, and would stray often. But he knew that in\ntheir time, men would continue to order their lives within Arda and by\ntheir _“operation everything should be, in form and deed, completed, and\nthe world fulfilled unto the last and the smallest”_ (_The\nSilmarillion_). Thus Men would become the implements by which Ilúvatar's\nplans for Arda will be realized in the ages to come.\n\nThe Gift, as originally bequeathed, was not something that Men feared.\nThough they loved their lives within Arda, they relinquished their\nspirits gracefully, almost gladly, and seemed to pass into a peaceful\nsleep, never to wake again in this life. But their souls go to a place\nunknown to the wisest of Elves or even the Valar.\n\nHowever it is written that when the Second Music of the Ainur is played,\nafter the Dagor Dagorath, the spirits of Men shall be included in this\neven greater theme, when all of the players will know and understand\ntheir part and its relation to the whole, and be tributary to its beauty\nand glory.\n\n\nAvoidance of the Gift of Men\n\nThe shadow of the first Dark Lord brought with it a perversion of the\noriginal intent of the Gift of Ilúvatar, and brought fear out of hope,\nand tainted the Gift. Men began to fear and despise the gift, and began\nto view it not as liberation, but as damnation. It brought about in the\nrace of Men a kind of self-loathing and a denial of the basic nature of\ntheir being as the children of the All-Father Eru Ilúvatar. Instead they\nviewed themselves as flawed in some way and sought to resist this very\nintrinsic nature of their creation. The result of such actions brought\nabout much anguish on the race of Men through the centuries of the\nhistory of Arda.\n\nAt least four characters in _The Lord of the Rings_ are examples of the\ndangers of either deliberately or unintentionally trying to avoid the\nGift of Men. Three of them are transformed into “monsters” by being\ndenied the Gift of Men by sins that they have committed: the Lord of the\nNazgûl (and all of the Nazgûl), the King of the Dead, and Sméagol.\n(Since Sméagol is a Hobbit-like creature, he is numbered among the\nYounger Children of Ilúvatar, and as such is entitled to the strange\nGift of Men.) The Nazgûl are made immortal, but also doomed, by the Nine\nRings. The King of the Dead is transformed into a ghost or monster by\nthe curse of Isildur, because he and his subjects break an oath to fight\nagainst Sauron. Long after his natural death, he fulfils his oath, and\nis released from his condition by Aragorn. (This presumably also applies\nto the other Dead.) Sméagol is consumed by the Ring; over the years, its\ninfluence transforms him from a Hobbit into the freakish Gollum.\n\nBilbo Baggins, like Sméagol, is a Hobbit rather than a Man, but Hobbits\nare also among the Younger Children of Ilúvatar, and are therefore\nrecipients of the Gift of Men. Bilbo encounters Gollum in his cave and\nescapes with the Ring. Being a Hobbit of much better character than\nSméagol, Bilbo better resists the negative effects of possessing the One\nRing. He does not appear to age considerably, but has a sense of\nbecoming “thin and stretched.” Toward the end of his possession of the\nRing, Bilbo begins to show some of the obsessive tendencies of Gollum —\ncalling the Ring “my precious,” and showing flashes of dark hostility\nwhen asked by Gandalf to give the Ring to his heir, Frodo. After the\nRings destruction, Bilbo's appearance begins to show signs of age and\nweariness.\n\nThose Men with the greatest understanding treated death as the Gift it\nwas originally intended to be, and when their time came gladly gave\nthemselves up to it. We see this, for example, in the earlier Kings of\nNúmenor, and Aragorn also accepted the Gift at the natural end of his\nlife. For most Men, though, the Gift was tainted by Morgoth, and they\ncame to fear it rather than embrace it. This fear reached its peak in\nthe later years of Númenor, where even the long life given to the\nNúmenóreans was not enough, and wise men did all they could to try to\nescape death altogether. In the end, this desperation led to Númenor's\ndestruction when Ar-Pharazôn led a battle fleet to the Undying Lands,\nhaving been convinced by Sauron's lies that they held the key to the\nimmortality of the Elves. This deception and treachery eventually saw\nthe lifespans of Men return to more normal times. Even after millennia,\nthe descendants of Numenor still possessed some extended lifespans\nbeyond typical Men; these men became known as the Dúnedain. de:Gabe der\nMenschen it:Fato degli Uomini"

    "text": "TOM, BERT, AND WILLIAM (“Bill”) Huggins were three Stone trolls that\nBilbo Baggins encountered in the Trollshaws, in Eriador, while with\nThorin and Company on their quest to regain the Lonely Mountain\n(Erebor). Like most of their kind outside of Mordor, they were vagabonds\nwho robbed, stole, and killed for what they needed or wanted. Their age\nis unknown. They were destroyed by sunlight which turned them to stone\nwith the aid of Gandalf's trickery.\n\n\nBiography\n\nQuest to the Lonely Mountain\n\nWhen Bilbo tried to pick William's pocket to test his skill as a\nburglar, William's purse squealed, alerting him. The trio of Trolls\ncaptured Bilbo who, almost revealing himself as a burglar, identified\nhimself as a “bur—a hobbit”, which they mistook for a “burrahobbit”.\nEventually all of the dwarves in Thorin's company came looking for\nBilbo, and were waylaid by the trolls and put into sacks. The trolls\nthen discussed ways to kill and eat the dwarves, until Gandalf came and\nmimicked the Trolls' voices, starting a fight amongst them. He kept them\narguing about how to cook the dwarves until dawn came, and the Sun\nturned them into stone before they could get to cover. Afterward, Thorin\nand Company found and explored Tom, Bert, and William's cave.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring\n\n\n\nOn the way to Rivendell, Aragorn and the four hobbits Frodo Baggins,\nSamwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took encountered the\nthree trolls that had been turned to stone seventy-seven years\npreviously, and the hobbits momentarily thought them to be alive.\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nThere is some confusion as to what breed of Troll they were, some saying\nStone Trolls—this confusion being easily illustrated by the fact that\nseveral different pages of this wiki detailing breeds of Troll list\nthese three as members of that particular breed.\n\n\nAppearances\n\nBooks\n\n-   _The Hobbit_ (First appearance)\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring_ (statues only)\n\nFilms\n\n-   _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_\n-   _The Hobbit (1977 animated film)_\n-   _The Fellowship of the Ring (film)_ (statues only)\n\nVideo games\n\n-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age_ (statues only)\n-   _The Lord of the Rings Online_ (statues only)\n-   _LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game_ (statues only)\n-   _LEGO The Hobbit: The Video Game_\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nIn the ZX Spectrum adaptation of _The Hobbit_, which was probably the\nfirst full licensed adaptation (Wikipedia link, World Of Spectrum link),\nthere were only two trolls featured (probably due to the memory\nlimitations of 8-bit computers), and it is not known which two these\nwere. (Likewise, the game reduced the band of dwarves to just Thorin.)\n\nThe Hobbit film trilogy\n\nIn _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_, the three trolls are encountered\nby Bilbo, Fíli and Kíli after having stolen several of the dwarves'\nponies. Fíli and Kíli stay back, while Bilbo tries to steal a blade from\nthe trolls to cut the ponies free. When Bilbo is caught accidentally by\nthe trolls, the dwarves charge them and a small skirmish ensuses as\nBilbo tries to free the ponies. However, Bilbo is caught, and when the\ntrolls threaten to tear Bilbo apart, the dwarves surrender and are put\ninto sacks. Half of the dwarves are put onto the spit to be cooked over\nthe fire, while the others, including Thorin, along with Bilbo, are left\non the ground in their sacks. Bilbo spots Gandalf sneaking around, and\nbegins to discuss with the trolls ways of cooking dwarf in order to buy\ntime. As this plan starts to fail as Tom attempts to eat Bombur raw,\nBilbo quickly states the dwarves are infested with intestinal parasites\nto try to stop the trolls from eating them, but they do not get easily\nfooled, especially William. Then Gandalf appears, and as the trolls\ncuriously wonder who he is (and if he can be eaten), the wizard using\nhis staff splits a rock that was shielding the trolls from the sun's\nlight as it rises, turning them to stone. After the company was set\nfree, Thorin and Gandalf believe that the trolls never ventured this far\nsouth from the Ettenmoors since the Second Age, when a darker power\nruled the lands.\n\nThe Trolls also make an appearance in the Battle of Middle Earth games\nin the Weather Top skirmish/multiplayer map. On the far right side by a\nsmall stream stand the three petrified trolls.\n\nThey were portrayed by William Kircher, Peter Hambleton, and Mark Hadlow\n(who also played the dwarves Bifur, Gloin and Dori in the film series)\nby motion capture in the first part of the film.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film trilogy\n\nIn Peter Jackson's first film of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, _The\nFellowship of the Ring (2001)_, Bilbo recounts the story of his\nencounter with the trolls to several hobbit-children at his 111th\nbirthday party.\n\nIn the Extended Version, after Frodo had been stabbed on Weathertop by\nthe Nazgûl Lord and before Arwen arrives to take him to Rivendell, the\ntrolls are seen, still turned to stone and Sam indicates them to Frodo,\nsaying, “Look, Mr. Frodo. Mr. Bilbo's trolls”.\n\nIt is unknown why Bilbo doesn't mention how Gandalf caused the trolls to\nbe turned into stone by exposing them to the sunlight and saving Bilbo\nand the dwarves, while telling about his encounter to the children\nduring his birthday party. He only mentions the sunlight turning the\ntrolls into stone.\n\nGene Deitch (1966)\n\nTrolls in Gene Deitch's film were greenish, wet, and are dressed with\nmore filthiness than in the Peter Jackson's work.\n\nVideo games\n\n-   The three petrified trolls can also be found in the Trollshaws both\n    in _The Lord of the Rings Online_ game, and in ''LEGO The Lord of\n    the Rings: The Video Game. They can also be seen scattered\n    throughout Eregion in _The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age_. They\n    make an appearance in _LEGO The Hobbit: The Video Game_.''"

    "page_id": "8048",
    "text": "Description\n\nA phalanx was a formation of soldiers that formed multiple ranks of\nwarriors supporting each other with spears, pikes, and/or halberds. The\nphalanx is an extremely formidable formation on the offensive and\ndefensive. This fighting formation led the Greeks to many victories.\n\nA phalanx is a tightly-packed group of soldiers (depending on the\nterrain and formation, usually 250-500+ soldiers per phalanx) that is\narmed with polearms. The first few rows protrude their spears on a\nhorizontal level, while the second, third, and so forth rows point their\npolearms in upward intervals until the very last rows have their weapons\npointed completely upward. They are not to be confused with the similar\n''tercios, ''a 16th-century Spanish fighting formation.\n\n\n\nThe phalanx did have its uses. Cavalry did not dare stride anywhere\nclose to the bristling hedgehog of steel weapon-heads, knowing full well\nthat they and their horses would be impaled on the advancing pikes.\nThus, it was a cheap and effective anti-cavalry formation that could\nenable a breakthrough by infantrymen that would otherwise be run down\nlike wheat in the field by horsemen. The only known cavalry in\nMiddle-earth that could possibly negate or minimize the effect of the\nphalanx were the Kataphrakts of Rhûn, who were thickly-clad in sumptuous\nand supremely expensive plate armor.\n\nInterestingly enough, the phalanx could also be used to negate or\ncompletely nullify the effect or enemy arrowheads. The vast forest of\nspears facing upward can cause arrows to break, deflect from their\ntargets, or fracture. This would prove a severe disadvantage to\ncivilizations which heavily depended on ranged weaponry (i.e. the\nGaladhrim, Thranduil's woodland Elves).\n\n\nTypes of Phalanxes\n\nDefensive\n\nThis is the most basic form of a phalanx, quite commonly a defensive\nphalanx would consist of, the first rank would kneel with their spears\nor pikes held out at about the height of their shoulders, the next rank\nwould also kneel and hold their spears slightly higher, followed by the\nnext row standing with their spears angled slightly above the row before\nthem. On occasion the phalanx would consist of a few additional rows but\nthey commonly consisted of only three rows of troops.\n\nIn the great battles of Middle-earth, almost every army of every faction\nutilized the phalanx, due to its supreme lethality and effectiveness\nagainst cavalry and infantry alike.\n\nThe First Age\n\nThe War of the Great Jewels\n\nDuring the Nirnaeth Arnoediad (Battle of Unnumbered Tears) of the First\nAge, the 10,000-strong army of Pikemen sent out by Turgon, the King of\nGondolin, would have most certainly utilized this formation in open\nbattle. Although we have no specific mention of it in Tolkien's\nlegendarium, this formation is probably the only thing that stood\nbetween the fleeing forces of the Eldarand the Edain and certain\ndestruction at the hands of Orcs and Balrogs. The hitherto-invincible\ncamouflaged cavalry of Morgoth were stayed and broken upon the pikes of\nGondolin, while Orcs died by the boatload upon the cold steel of the\nElves. Their delaying action kept the flame of resistance going against\nMorgoth, and the valor of the Elves of Gondolin led to his eventual\ndownfall.\n\nThe Second Age\n\nThe army of the Númenóreans also used these formations, as evidenced in\nthe Battle of Dagorlad, during the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. It\nwas supremely effective at halting significant Orcish advances and the\nindomitable reach of the infantrymen in the phalanx gave the archers\nample protection to continue the round-the-clock slaughter of Sauron's\narmy.\n\nThe Third Age and Beyond\n\nDuring the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the army of Orcs vainly\nutilized a crude and sloppy phalanx formation of even cruder polearms to\nstop the deluge of Rohirrim. It failed miserably, stating that even the\nbest tactics will be futile while used by a lacking army.\n\n\nOffensive\n\nThis form of phalanx is far more aggressive form of a phalanx in which\nall the troops participating in the phalanx remain standing at all times\nand march towards the enemy lines. This form of attack usually consists\nof only two rows of troops as this makes the formation just that much\nmore maneuverable, and allows for a quick transit from offensive to\ndefensive formation.\n\n\nVariations\n\nThe most common variation of a standard phalanx was known as a\n“shield-wall phalanx”, (employed by the Easterlings) in which all ranks\nof soldiers would be equipped with shields and would form a wall of\nshields that would extend across the entire front row and along both of\nthe sides of the formation to protect all troops contained within the\nphalanx, it also allowed for the troops on the inside to shift\nthemselves to support any side that was pressed by enemies and to easily\nfill any gaps that were caused by casualties as the battles wore on.\nThis variation also allowed for the rear rows to about face and to\nprotect the rear of the column far more effectively than a standard\nphalanx. Another clever pike formation invented by the Easterlings (but\nwas used by all spearmen of Middle-earth) was the porcupine formation,\nit combined the sheer impenetrability of a phalanx with the highly\neffective Shiltron that protected the flanks. (Featured in battle for\nmiddle earth game) It was mainly used as a last stand formation or as an\nanti-outflanking formation that could defend those in formation from all\nangles of attack. The way it was used was that the officer would shout\n“porcupine!” and the spearmen would put their polearms forward and form\na circle, hence the name porcupine.\n\nAnother common variation of a phalanx was employed by the Guard of the\nFountain Court crudely referred to as a “mini phalanx” in which the\nsoldiers would form the phalanx in the same way as stated above, but it\nwould only consist of two rows of troops and they would only be\npositioned to defend forwards instead of defending their flanks."

    "text": "This is an overview of the COSMOLOGY of J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth\nlegendarium. Each entry is followed by any alternate names, any roughly\ncorresponding primary world name in parentheses, and a brief\ndescription. A question mark after the primary world name indicates that\nthe identification may be partially speculative or disputed.\n\n-   TIMELESS HALLS, (Heaven) - The home of Eru (God) outside of Time.\n    They are similar to Heaven in that they exist outside the boundaries\n    of the universe and in that they do not have a physical form. It is\n    unknown whether they are the final destination of the souls of Men.\n    This is a distinct possibility, however. In fact, it is confirmed in\n    the tale of Adanel that Men return to Eru, but it is questionable\n    that this tale can be considered canon, although Christopher Tolkien\n    once considered putting it in the appendices of the Silmarillion.\n\n-   THE VOID, Avakúma, Kúma, the Outer Dark, the Eldest Dark, the\n    Everlasting Dark - An abstract, uninhabited region of nothingness\n    described as existing outside the Timeless Halls, Arda, and all of\n    Eä. It is possible that the Void outside of Eä and the one\n    surrounding Arda were different, but this is not clearly defined. No\n    being in the Void can use any power they possess within the Void.\n    Melkor was cast into THE VOID after the War of Wrath, but legend\n    predicts his return to the world before the end, in Dagor Dagorath.\n\n-   EÄ, (the Universe) - EÄ is the Quenya name for the universe, as a\n    realization of the vision of the Ainur. The word comes from the\n    Quenya word for _to be_. Thus, Eä is _the World that Is_, as\n    distinguished from _the World that Is Not_. It may thus be assumed\n    that everything outside Eä, including the Timeless Halls of\n    Ilúvatar, has no material form. The Ainur, angelic beings from the\n    Timeless Halls beyond Eä, refer to it as “the Little Kingdom”. This\n    refers to the fact that within the mind of Eru Ilúvatar (God), all\n    creation that humans can see is really just a tiny thing in\n    comparison. _Eä_ was the word spoken by Eru Ilúvatar by which he\n    brought the universe into actuality.\n\n    -   ARDA, Ilu - See Arda. The world, including everything in the\n        skies around it.\n\n        -   VAIYA, Ekkaia, the Enfolding Ocean, the Encircling Sea,\n            (Outer space) - A dark sea that surrounds the world before\n            the cataclysm at the end of the Second Age. Vaiya flows\n            completely around the world, forming a sea below it and a\n            form of air above it. Arda is described as floating on\n            Vaiya, like a ship on a sea. Ulmo, the Lord of Waters,\n            dwells in Vaiya, below the roots of Arda. Vaiya is described\n            as extremely cold. Where its waters meet the waters of\n            Belegaer in the northwest of Middle-earth, a chasm of ice is\n            formed, the Helcaraxë. Vaiya cannot support any ships except\n            the boats of Ulmo; the ships of the Númenóreans that tried\n            to sail on it sank, drowning the sailors. After Arda was\n            made round, Vaiya apparently disappeared, although it may\n            have been changed into the upper atmosphere of the world.\n\n            -   ILMEN, (the Solar system) - A region of clean air\n                pervaded by light before the cataclysm at the end of the\n                Second Age. The stars and other celestial bodies are\n                found in this region. Tolkien likely derived its name\n                from _ilma_, the Finnish word for air. The Moon passes\n                through Ilmen on its way around the world, plunging down\n                the Chasm of Ilmen on its way back.\n\n                -   ALCARINQUE, Morwen, Silindo, (Jupiter?)\n\n                -   ANARRIMA\n\n                -   ANOR, Ur, (the Sun) See Sun.\n\n                -   BORGIL, (Aldebaran?)\n\n                -   CARNIL, (Mars?)\n\n                -   EARENDIL’S STAR, Gil-Amdir, Gil-Estel,\n                    Gil-Oresetel, Gil-Orrain, (Venus)\n\n                -   EKSIQILTA, Ekta-, (Orion’s Belt)\n\n                -   ELEMMÍRË, (Mercury?)\n\n                -   HELLUIN, Gil, Nielluin, Nierninwa, (Sirius)\n\n                -   ITHIL, Silmo, (the Moon) See Moon.\n\n                -   LUINIL, (Uranus?)\n\n                -   LUMBAR, (Saturn?)\n\n                -   MENELVAGOR, Daimord, Menelmacar, Mordo,\n                    Swordsman of the Sky, Taimavar, Taimondo,\n                    Telimbektar, Telimektar, Telumehtar, (Orion) - A\n                    constellation meant to represent Túrin Turambar and\n                    his eventual return to defeat Melkor in The Last\n                    Battle. Menelmacar superseded the older form,\n                    Telumehtar (which nonetheless continued in use), and\n                    was itself adopted into Sindarin as Menelvagor.\n\n                -   MORWINYON, (Arcturus)\n\n                -   NENAR, (Neptune?)\n\n                -   REMMIRATH, Itselokte, Sithaloth,\n                    (Pleiades)\n\n                -   SORONUME\n\n                -   TELUMENDIL\n\n                -   TIL\n\n                -   VALACIRCA, Burning Briar, Durin’s Crown,\n                    Edegil, Otselen, the Plough, Sickle of the\n                    Valar, Seven Stars, Seven Butterflies,\n                    Silver Sickle, Timbridhil, (Ursa Major / Big\n                    Dipper) - An important constellation of seven\n                    stars set in the sky by Varda as an enduring warning\n                    to Melkor and his servants, and which precipitated\n                    the Awakening of the Elves. It also formed the\n                    symbol of Durin, seen on the doors of Moria, and\n                    inspired a song of defiance from Beren. According to\n                    the _Silmarillion_, it was set in the Northern Sky\n                    as a sign of doom for Melkor and a sign of hope for\n                    the Elves. The Valacirca is one of the few\n                    constellations named in the book, another\n                    significant one being Menelvagor.\n\n                -   WILWARIN, (Cassiopeia?)\n\n                -   VISTA, Air, (the Atmosphere) - Vista is the\n                    breathable air.\n\n                    -   FANYAMAR, Cloudhome - The upper air where clouds\n                        form.\n\n                    -   AIWENÓRË, Bird-land - The lower air where the\n                        paths of birds are found.\n\n                        -   AMBAR, Imbar, (Earth) - The actual solid\n                            land mass of the world. Middle-earth is one\n                            continent of Ambar.\n\n                        -   ËAR, (Oceans) - The seas of the world."

Opinion is divided on this as Boromir wants to\npass through Gondor, the land of his people, which he thinks will be the\nsafer option. Also, not understanding the power of the Ring, he thinks\nthat Gondor would be able to use it and so have the power to overthrow\nSauron. However, Aragorn is reluctant to lead the ring anywhere near\nMinas Tirith, as he does not trust Denethor and his men. While they are\nresting, Frodo walks off alone to sit beside the river and the Falls of\nRauros. He is soon joined by Boromir, who talks to Frodo, giving him\nadvice, although Frodo has already been warned by Galadriel that his\nfriends will turn against him. Boromir's words become more and more\naggressive, saying that the Ring should not be destroyed, but used\nagainst Sauron, and he asks Frodo to lend him the Ring. When Frodo\nrefuses, he becomes angry and tries to take it by force, causing Frodo\nto put on the Ring, disappear and run away. After a minute he realizes\nwhat he has done and weeps, begging Frodo to come back, but Frodo is\nalready far away.\n\nFrodo then realizes the effect that the Ring is having on his\ncompanions, and that slowly it will destroy them all. He decides to\ncontinue the Quest on his own and from there journeys to Mordor alone,\nso that his friends will not have to suffer on his behalf. As he is\nabout to leave in the boat, Sam comes running out and insists on going\nwith Frodo. When Frodo tells him to go back, Sam wades out into the\nwater towards the boat even though he cannot swim, and begins to drown,\nprompting Frodo to rescue him. Although originally annoyed, Frodo\nrealizes that Sam will be useful for the journey ahead, and that he\nneeds a good friend to help him along. The Fellowship of the Ring ends\nwith Frodo and Sam beginning their journey together towards Mordor.\n\nThe Two Towers opens with the rest of the fellowship searching for\nFrodo, until they hear Boromir's horn, signalling that he was in need,\nalong with Orc voices. Aragorn arrives to find Boromir lying by a tree\nsurrounded by dead Orcs, and pierced with many arrows. With Boromir's\nlast words he tells Aragorn not to let Minas Tirith fall. He also tells\nhim that the Orcs (later known to be Uruk-hai) have taken the Hobbits.\nReturning to the boats and finding one gone, along with Frodo and Sam's\npacks, Aragorn concludes that Frodo and Sam have gone on alone to\nMordor. The Three Hunters (Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli) then have to\ndecide whether to follow Frodo and Sam or to go after the Uruk-hai to\nrescue Merry and Pippin. Aragorn eventually decides that the fate of the\nRingbearer was no longer in his hands, and refusing to abandon Merry and\nPippin to torment and death, decides to go after them.\n\n\nPortrayal in Adaptions\n\nFilms\n\nIn Ralph Bakshi's version, Boromir confronts Frodo in his thinking place\nand Frodo talks of his fears. Boromir offers his advice to Frodo and\nFrodo already knows of what he wants him to do and that was to take the\nRing to Gondor to defend Minas Tirith. Boromir becomes irritated with\nthe decision to destroy the Ring and Frodo tries to tell him that all\nthat touches the Ring turns to evil, but Boromir doesn't listen and asks\nFrodo to lend him the Ring. Frodo refuses and Boromir tries to seize him\nand take the Ring by force. He jumps forward but Frodo gets away.\nBoromir curses him and accuses him of being a traitor. He then comes to\nhis senses and begs Frodo to come back but to no avail as Frodo has\nalready gone. Boromir returns to Aragorn and the others and is asked\nwhere he has been he confesses what he had done to Frodo. Sam becomes\nconcerned and runs away to search for Frodo. Aragorn tries to maintain\ncontrol and asks Legolas and Gimli to stop them. He grabs Boromir and\norders him to protect Merry and Pippin.\n\nThe Orcs band appears and try to seize the Halflings. Boromir reappears\nand fights them killing several by to no avail as he was pierced by many\narrows, and the hobbits are taken. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli arrive,\nbut they are too late. Boromir tells Aragorn that he tried to take the\nRing and begs Aragorn to go to Minas Tirith to save his people. Aragorn\nagrees and then Boromir dies. They set Boromir in one of their boats\nwith his helmet and weapons and then talk. Aragorn speaks of the\nbreaking of the Fellowship and that the fate of the Ring being out of\ntheir hands and makes the decision to follow the orcs that took Merry\nand Pippin.\n\nIn the Peter Jackson's film version, The Fellowship is ambushed by a\ngroup of Uruk-Hai Scouts lead by Lurtz. The Fellowship then do battle\nwith the scouts around different points, Frodo escaping, Boromir, Merry,\nand Pippin fighting their way downwards and Gimli, Legolas, and Aragorn\ndefending themselves. Boromir, starting to be overwhelmed, begins to\ncall for help by sounding his horn, to which, Aragorn hears and begins\nto run to him. Before Aragorn can get there however, Lurtz appears and\nmanages to shoot Boromir three times with an Uruk Hai Bow. Aragorn\narrives just as Lurtz is going to shoot Boromir for the fourth time.\nStopping him, the two duel, resulting in Lurtz's arm being chopped off,\nimpaled through the chest, and then beheaded, finally killing him.  \n\n\nTranslation around the World\n\n  Foreign Language   Translated name\n  ------------------ ----------------------------\n  Polish             Rozpad Drużyny Pierścienia"

    "text": "The WOODLAND REALM, later known as MIRKWOOD, was a kingdom of Silvan\nElves located deep in the Forest of the Wilderland beginning in the\nSecond Age. King Thranduil of the Sindar rules over the Silvan Elves.\nThe Elves of the Woodland Realm, unlike many Elves, were known to be\nless wise and more dangerous, but were nevertheless one of the most\npowerful and legendary of the Elves of Middle-earth.\n\nLegolas, a key member of the Fellowship of the Ring in the Third Age,\nhailed from here.\n\n\nHistory\n\nEarly\n\nDuring the latter half of the Years of the Trees and the First Age, the\nNandorin and Avarin Elves populated the forest between the Misty\nMountains and the Far East lands, mixing themselves together becoming\nSilvan Elves or Wood-elves. It is not known how they lived but it is\npossible they lived in small tribal groups wandering the forest.\n\nSecond Age\n\nAfter the War of Wrath and the destruction of the Beleriand, Oropher, a\nSindarin prince formerly of Doriath who chose to stay in Middle-earth,\ncame to the forest known as Greenwood the Great. He and his company were\nwell received and well accepted as they had once lived with King\nThingol, whom they regarded as distant kin. The Sindarin company\nintended to live like the Wood-elves: natural and undisturbed. This\nnotion was appealing to the Wood-elves and Oropher was soon named their\nking, adopting their language and way of life.\n\nAfter being named King of the Woodland Realm, Oropher established his\ncapital on Amon Lanc in the southern part of the forest. The Woodland\nrealm flourished in peace with its boundaries unchanged and way of life\nundisturbed for over a millennium. Sometime after SA 1000, Oropher had\nhis capital moved further north in around the Mountains of Mirkwood. The\nmain reason for this was the growing threat of Sauron in the East.\nOropher and his people also felt threatened by the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm\nand by the presence of Celeborn and Galadriel in the forest. Despite\nthese problems, the Elves of the Woodland Realm still continued to roam\nthe south of the forest westward down the Anduin.\n\nOver one hundred years after the Downfall of Númenor, the threat of\nSauron once again grew into a very real threat to Middle-earth. Oropher\nand the Elves of Lórien under Amdír both agreed that peace could not be\nresorted until Sauron was completely defeated. A large army was created\nand a combined force of Wood-elves and Galadhrim marched to support the\nLast Alliance of Elves and Men. Though they were as determined to defeat\nSauron as the others, Oropher and Amdír's army was lightly armed and\nless experienced in major warfare. They also refused to submit to the\nsupreme authority of Gil-galad due to past disputes with Ñoldor, and so\nfought independently. They suffered heavy losses and Oropher and Amdír\nwere both killed. Oropher's son survived the war and took his father's\nplace as King of the Woodland Realm.\n\nThird Age\n\nDespite the heavy losses their people had suffered during the War of the\nLast Alliance, the Elves of the Woodland Realm survived and continued\nliving peacefully in the forest for the next millennium. The peace was\nbroken in TA 1050 when a mysterious being known as the Necromancer began\nliving in the abandoned halls of Amon Lanc. Afterwards, the forest\nbecame dark and tainted, infested with Orcs, Great Spiders, and other\nmysterious and savage beings. The elves were then forced to remove\nthemselves to the northernmost part of the forest. All settlements in\nthe Mountains of Mirkwood were withdrawn and the capital and realm's\npeople relocated to a cave settlement under a wooded hill, in the\nnortheastern border of the forest. From then on, the Woodland Realm\nremained confined to the north. It was at this time that the Elves\nrenamed the forest to Mirkwood along other with other places they\nformerly occupied.\n\nThe Elves of the Woodland Realm survived but lived more cautiously\nconsidering the increased danger. They traded with the neighboring\nrealms of the Lonely Mountain and Dale. This however was not to last as\nthe Elves, Rhovanion and much of Middle-earth was affected by bad\nweather culminating in the Long Winter of TA 2758 and TA 2759 and the\nFell Winter of TA 2911 - TA 2912, during which extreme cold and large\nblankets of snow plagued the lands. However, the most devastating blow\nto the Woodland Realm until the War of the Ring came in TA 2770 when the\ndragon Smaug came down from the North and destroyed both the Dwarves of\nthe Lonely Mountain and the Mannish town of Dale. Afterwards, the elves\nmoved about the forest in secret and were very distrustful of any\nstrangers and their only contact with the outside world was trade and\noccasional visitation with the refugees of Dale living in Laketown on\nthe Long Lake. It was probably during this time that the Elves made the\nForest Path which ran across the northern forest as the only safe\npassage, as the main road that ran through was no longer safe.\n\nIn TA 2941, Thorin and Company came through the Woodland Realm on their\nway to the Lonely Mountain on The Quest of Erebor. Thranduil considered\nthem trespassers and had them imprisoned save for Bilbo, who remained\ninvisible with the use of his Magic Ring, who later released them.\nAfter the death of Smaug, Thranduil offered relief to the Men of\nLaketown for Bard’s valiant slaying of the dragon and assembled an army\nto claim part of the treasure, but Thorin refused to share it and so\nboth parties prepared for war. Bilbo tried to help the situation by\ndelivering the ancient artifact known as the Arkenstone to the Elves and\nMen.\n\nThe situation did not improve and with arrival of a Dwarven army of\nfive-hundred under Dáin II Ironfoot, and it seemed as if the Elves and\nMen would fight the Dwarves, but the timely arrival of Gandalf with a\nwarning of an army of Goblins and Wargs coming to do battle for the\ntreasure changed everything. The Elves, Men, and Dwarves were forced to\njoin forces and fight a common enemy. The Wood-elves and their allies,\nincluding the late-arriving Eagles, defeated the orcs and many lay dead,\nbut peace finally returned to the region with the Orcs defeated and news\nof the White Council having driven the Necromancer out of Dol Guldur.\n\nPeace for the Elves of the Woodland Realm reigned for decades until Dol\nGuldur once again was inhabited by evil creatures and Mordor grew in\npower and influence. The Woodland Realm became involved directly in the\nWar of the Ring when the creature Gollum was captured by Aragorn and\nimprisoned there, but an orc raid allowed him to escape. Afterwards,\nThranduil sent his son Legolas to Rivendell as a representative of the\nWoodland Realm and to inform the Council of Gollum’s escape.\n\nThe Woodland Realm was attacked on March 15, 3019 by forces from Dol\nGuldur, becoming part of the Battles of the North. Thranduil and the\nWood-elves were victorious and the forest was eventually cleansed of all\nits enemies and as Galadriel had thrown down the walls Dol Guldur, there\nwas no longer any threat from there and the shadow was permanently\nremoved from the forest. On April 6, 3019, Thranduil met with Celeborn\nand both agreed to rename the forest Eryn Lasgalen (Wood of\nGreenleaves). Soon after the war, the forest was divided with Thranduil\nleft to rule most of the northern part.\n\nFourth Age\n\nThe Woodland Realm people played an important role during the early\nyears when a group of Elves from the Woodland Realm led by Legolas\ntraveled to Gondor and helped rebuild the city of Minas Tirith and\nreplenished and beautified the war-ravaged lands of Ithilien. It is\npresumed that the realm prospered but like the other non-mannish realms\nit most likely became isolated and unto itself. Its fate is unknown but\nas some Elves left Middle-earth during the Fourth Age and the dominion\nof Man was at hand, the Wood-elves of the Woodland Realm may have\neventually become hidden and ultimately invisible to the eyes of Men."

    "title": "Ravenhill",
    "page_id": "9334",
    "text": "RAVENHILL was an outlying hill beneath the Lonely Mountain. It is ruled\nand inhabited by Ravens.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Ravenhill extended southward from the mountain, looking over River\nRunning and the valley of Dale. The Dwarves built a guard-post there,\nabove which the Ravens resided, led by Roäc. In the time that the\nDwarves were driven from Lonely Mountain by Smaug, Roäc's father Carc\nwas the chief of the ravens. It was for the ravens that the hill was\nnamed.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nThe Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\n\nIn _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_, Ravenhill is portrayed\nas a snow covered plateau half hidden in the mist on the slopes of the\nLonely Mountain.\n\nIt is a ruined exposed fortress lying on the rock. The fortress has a\ntower that looms over exposed tunnels and stairways. Next to the\nfortress is the running river, Celduin, that is frozen in the winter.\nUnderneath the frozen pool is a waterfall that cascades down the cliff\nface. This too, is frozen solid. Above all this, is a crumbling rock\ntower were Azog places his command post on, during the battle. It is\nhere where Azog uses makeshift totems to command the legions below.\n\nAzog seizes Ravenhill as his command post from which he coordinates his\nforces against the allied Dwarves, Elves and Men. Using a series of\nbanners and a horn to communicate battle strategies, he sends signals to\nthe two different armies under his charge, initiating a war on two\nfronts (at the gates of the Lonely Mountain and within Dale). The Pale\nOrc shouts out commands to his fellow Orcs. One Orc blows the horn,\nwhile others use the huge banner-totems to command the legions down\nbelow.\n\nWhen Thorin and the Dwarves emerge from Lonely Mountain, they rally the\nDwarves under Dáin II Ironfoot to break the Orc lines. Thorin sees Azog\non the broken tower of Ravenhill and he decides to “cut the head off the\nsnake”.\n\nThorin, along with Dwalin, Fíli and Kíli ride upon the backs of rams to\ncharge the hill and confront Azog. It is there that they are ambushed by\nAzog as his army from Gundabad approached from the north, Azog's Orcs\novercame Fíli, executing him in front of Thorin from across the River\nRunning, beginning the climactic confrontation. It is at Ravenhill that\nFíli, Kíli and Thorin fall in battle, as well as Azog and Bolg.\n\nAzog's command post\n\nAt the start of the battle, Ravenhill is continuously shown when Azog\ncommands his armies from above. Standing on the edge of the ruined tower\nthat overlooks The Valley Of Dale, Azog and several Orcs observe the\nbattle. At the start of it all. Azog commands his armies to attack. The\nhorn is blown and the banners are operated. Gandalf observes Azog's\nmaneuvers with the legions. As he does, Azog unleashes War Beasts and\ncommands his armies to “attack the city”, to cut the men and Elves off\nfrom Dale. After a while, The Pale Orc prepares a final assault to\nfinish the armies off. This fails when Thorin and The Company burst out\nand attack.\n\nSoon, Thorin spots the signal-post on top of Ravenhill, and he, Dwalin,\nFíli and Kíli ride on Rams up the mountainside to kill Azog, in hope\nthat the Orcs will be sent into confusion, without any commands.\n\nAzog then spots the commando team and makes himself scarce to lure the\nDwarves into a trap.\n\nA Death Trap\n\nThorin and his companions arrive at Ravenhill, only to find the misty\nareas deserted. Thorin refuses to believe Azog has fled, and sends Fíli\nand Kíli to search the interior of the fortress, while he and Dwalin\nguard the frozen lagoons. Suddenly a group of Goblins attack. Thorin and\nDwalin kill them, while Fíli and Kíli enter the towers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the valley below, Legolas warns Gandalf of the approaching\nlegions from Gundabad, arriving at Ravenhill. Bilbo realises that Thorin\nand the others are up there, and, to Gandalf's protest, he puts on The\nOne Ring, and heads up to warn Thorin of the approaching danger.\n\nIn the underground passages of Ravenhill, Fíli and Kíli split up, and\nhead in different directions. Bilbo arrives at this time and warns\nThorin and Dwalin of the approaching armies. Thorin puts two and two\ntogether and realizes they have been pulled into a death trap.\n\nMeanwhile, in the underground passages, Fíli is cornered by Orc\nsoldiers. Thorin and Bilbo then attempt to depart, but Azog suddenly\nemerges dragging Fíli, much to everyone's shock. In a damming speech\ndeclaring the end of the line of Durin at Ravenhill, Azog impales Fíli\nthrough the chest with his blade arm. Kíli races up to avenge him and\nThorin races over to rescue him. He is then attacked by Azog, and the\ntwo duel while Kíli subsequently fights the orcs. Bolg then arrives with\nan advance guard and attacks Bilbo and Dwalin. Legolas hitches a ride on\na War Bat, while Tauriel races up to find Kíli. Meanwhile, Thorin\nbriefly stops Azog, but is attacked by more orcs. Meanwhile, Bilbo is\nknocked unconscious by Bolg. Thorin finishes off the orcs, but Azog\nemerges, disarming Thorin. Thorin is knocked into a frozen lake, where\nhe fends off a swarm of Goblin Mercenaries with a dagger. Tauriel finds\nKíli, but is attacked by Bolg. She is almost killed when Kíli intervenes\nand is subsequently killed by Bolg. Tauriel then throws Bolg down the\nmountain, but is almost killed by Bolg again when Legolas intervenes,\ndrawing Orcrist. The two battle, while Thorin throws an Orc at Bolg\nunbalancing the bridge. Thorin, now defenseless, is almost killed, but\nLegolas hurls Orcrist killing the Orc and enabling Thorin to retrieve\nhis sword. Bolg subsequently re-merges and attacks Legolas who duels him\nwith two daggers. Thorin then battles Azog, now with a stone attached to\na chain."

    "title": "Realms in Exile",
    "page_id": "9887",
    "text": "'REALMS IN EXILE' was the collective name for the kingdoms, Arnor and\nGondor, established by the Dunedain in Middle-earth after they escaped\nthe Downfall of Númenor. For much of the Third Age, they were the\ndominant powers in the north-west of Middle-earth, and had an enduring\npolitical, economic and cultural significance. Initially politically\nunited, they soon became separate kingdoms, but retained much of their\ncommon culture, and later entered into an alliance. Arnor broke apart\ninto petty kingdoms, the last of which fell in TA 1974. Gondor survived\nand, though becoming ever weaker, it remained the most powerful state\namong the so-called “Free Peoples”. After the War of the Ring, Gondor\nand the former territories of Arnor were merged into the Reunited\nKingdom.\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\nBoth Arnor and Gondor were feudal absolute monarchies. Their first High\nKing was Elendil the Tall, the leader of the fugitives who escaped\nduring the Akallabêth and a member of the old Númenórean nobility. He\nruled Arnor directly, while Gondor was ruled jointly by his sons,\nIsildur and Anárion, who acted as his vassals. As a result of the War of\nthe Last Alliance (see below), the two kingdoms were politically\nseparated; Arnor was ruled by Isildur's descendants, and Gondor by those\nof Anárion. In a departure from Númenórean practice, equal primogeniture\nwas abolished in favour of an exclusively male succession, perhaps\nbecause of the role the King had in both realms as supreme army\ncommander and the frequent wars in which the realms were embroiled.\n\nWhile Arnor and Gondor are called “the realms of the Dúnedain”, in fact\nthe Dúnedain made up only a small part of their population. The bulk of\nthe human population in the north-west of Middle-earth consisted of\nnative Men and descendants of earlier Númenórean colonists, the two\ngroups having intermingled to varying degrees. The Dúnedain who arrived\nwith Elendil and his sons, being of pure Númenórean blood and culture,\nwere more gifted and powerful than the local inhabitants. Furthermore,\nthe House of Elendil commanded particular respect and loyalty on account\nof his descent from Elros and his ancestors' leadership of the Faithful\nin Númenor itself. The Dúnedain therefore quickly established themselves\nas a sort of hereditary aristocracy, and provided many of the realms'\nleading statesmen, administrators and military commanders. However,\nlocal tribes and lordships, many held by families not of Númenórean\ndescent, persisted, especially away from the great cities. Unlike the\nearlier colonists, the Dúnedain came to discourage intermarriage with\nthose they termed “lesser Men,” fearing perhaps that their gifts would\nbe bred out; this policy eventually had disastrous consequences for\nGondor.\n\nAmong themselves, the Dúnedain spoke a dialect of Sindarin, in token of\ntheir ancient friendship with the Elves, and to set themselves apart\nfrom the hostile “Black Númenóreans” who had established lordships in\nthe more southerly regions of Middle-earth. But in dealings with their\nsubject peoples and the surrounding nations, they used Westron, a\ndescendant of the Adûnaic language of Númenor, closely related to many\nof the Mannish dialects that already prevailed in their territories. In\nthis way, Westron (which also became known as the Common Speech) became\nthe everyday language of most of the inhabitants of the realms,\nincluding later immigrants such as the Shire-folk; and even other nearby\nindependent kingdoms and peoples, who had languages of their own, chose\nWestron for their dealings with foreigners, so that it became the\nlanguage of trade and diplomacy throughout the West. The Westron was\narguably the most enduring cultural legacy of the Realms in Exile.\n\n\nHistory\n\nSecond Age\n\nArnor and Gondor were founded in SA 3320, the year after the Akallabêth.\nHowever, Sauron, who hated Elendil and his family on account of their\nfriendship with the Elves and their opposition to his policies in\nNúmenor, had survived Númenor's downfall, in which he played a leading\npart. He returned to Middle-earth, and discovered that the power of the\nElves under Gil-galad had increased in his absence, and that the Realms\nin Exile, whose territory extended even to the borders of Mordor, were\ninclined to side with the Elves in the event of war. Thus, after a\nmostly peaceful century in which Elendil ruled in the north and Isildur\nand Anárion in the south, Sauron suddenly attacked Gondor (SA 3429),\ncapturing Minas Ithil and destroying its White Tree. Isildur fled to\nArnor, while Anárion defended Osgiliath and Minas Anor. In 3430,\nGil-galad and Elendil formed the Last Alliance, initially consisting of\nthe Realms in Exile and the Elf-kingdoms of Lindon and Imladris. The\nAlliance was soon joined by the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm and the Silvan\nElves of Mirkwood and Lórien. The Allies overthrew Sauron's forces at\nthe Battle of Dagorlad, and besieged Barad-dûr for seven years; Anárion,\nalong with many others, was killed during the siege. At last, seeing no\nother way to break the siege, Sauron himself came forth, and wrestled\nwith Elendil and Gil-galad on the slopes of Mount Doom; they defeated\nhim, but both perished. Isildur cut Sauron's ring of power from his hand\nand took it for his own. Sauron passed away into the shadows and the\nSecond Age ended.\n\nThird Age\n\nWith both Elendil and Anárion dead, the organisation of the Realms in\nExile became murky. Isildur became sole King of both Gondor and Arnor,\nbut instead of seeking to rule both Kingdoms personally, he instructed\nhis nephew Meneldil, the oldest surviving son of Anárion, before making\nhim responsible for ruling Gondor. Isildur, along with his three eldest\nsons (Elendur, Aratan and Ciryon), then journeyed north, Isildur\nintending to take up the high kingship of his father in Arnor. Some two\nthousand years later, Arvedui (Isildur's remote descendant in the north)\nand the Dúnedain of Gondor disagreed as to whether Isildur relinquished\nhis rights in Gondor, or whether he merely made Meneldil responsible for\nruling Gondor under his suzerainty.\n\nWhatever Isildur's plans, they were put to a sudden end when he and his\nthree eldest sons were killed in the Disaster of the Gladden Fields. In\nthat unexpected attack by Orcs, most of Isildur's followers were killed;\nhe himself escaped, taking advantage of the Ring's power of\ninvisibility, but the Orcs tracked him to the Anduin. When he tried to\nswim across the river, the Ring slipped from his finger, and the Orcs\nsaw him and killed him with arrows. Of his entire army and entourage as\nhe journeyed north, only three eventually reached Arnor; among these was\nhis esquire, who had kept the shards of Elendil's famous sword Narsil.\nThat sword then became an heirloom of the Kingdom of Arnor.\n\nThe sceptre of Arnor now came to Valandil, the youngest of Isildur's\nfour sons, who had remained in Rivendell during the war, being still a\nchild when the Last Alliance attacked Sauron; but not until TA 10 did he\nactually assume his responsibilities. By this time, whatever Isildur's\noriginal intentions were, Meneldil in Gondor was a thoroughly\nindependent monarch, and Valandil and his successors in Arnor, badly\nweakened by Arnor's losses in the war, were in no position to exert\nauthority over Gondor, even if they had wished to do so. So it was that,\nin place of the unified entity of Elendil's day, two independent\nkingdoms arose.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that Arnor, despite its notional superiority,\nwas by now the weaker of the two realms. Although its territory\nencompassed almost all of vast Eriador, its population was severely\ndiminished and it never really recovered. In TA 861, Arnor was divided\ninto the three petty kingdoms of Arthedain, Rhudaur and Cardolan, which\nfrequently fought amongst themselves, weakening the northern Dúnedain\nstill further. About TA 1300, an evil power known as the Witch-king\nestablished the kingdom of Angmar in the mountainous wastes north of\nArthedain and Rhudaur, and proceeded to conquer the realms of the\nnorthern Dúnedain one by one. In Rhudaur, power was seized from the\nDúnedain in the 14th century by the native Hillmen, who allied\nthemselves with Angmar before eventually being annexed early in the 15th\ncentury. Cardolan was fatally weakened by a defeat at the hands of the\ncombined forces of Angmar and Rhudaur in TA 1409, and its few surviving\nDúnedain, along with most of its other inhabitants, were eventually\nwiped out in the Great Plague of TA 1636. Arthedain, the most powerful\nof the northern kingdoms and the only one in which the line of Isildur\nwas preserved, survived the longest, eventually falling to an all-out\ninvasion from Angmar in TA 1974. After the collapse of Arthedain, the\nsurviving Dúnedain became a wandering people, and secretly guarded\nEriador's few surviving settled communities, such as the Shire and Bree,\nagainst evil and wild creatures.\n\nIn the south, Gondor grew and flourished for a thousand years, gaining\nterritory to the north-east (southern Rhovanion), the north-west\n(Enedwaith) and the south (Umbar). It seems Gondor never sought to\nexpand further northwest than the Greyflood, and no records survive of\nconflict between Gondor and unified Arnor, or between Gondor and\nCardolan. But nor are there any records of alliance or friendly\ncommunication; Gondor seems rather to have been preoccupied with the\npeoples to its east and south, and with the threat of Mordor, which\nGondor guarded with a series of fortresses. Thus Gondor came to control\na vast territory by the time of Hyarmendacil I, but like Arnor it slowly\ndecayed through a combination of internal weaknesses and external\nthreats. Its Dúnedain population slowly shrank, the southern Dúnedain\ntending to marry late and have few children, so that Gondor gradually\nlost its main source of strength compared to the surrounding nations.\nDuring the second millennium of the Third Age, Gondor was hit by three\ngreat calamities. The first was the Kin-strife, a civil war brought\nabout by the marriage of King Valacar to a foreign woman and the\naccession of their son; during the Kin-strife, the Dúnedain aristocracy\nwas decimated, the great _palantír_ of Osgiliath lost, and Umbar was\nwrested from Gondor by the survivors of the rebel faction. The second,\nthe Great Plague that wreaked havoc in Cardolan (see above), had earlier\nkilled great numbers of the people of Gondor. The third calamity, a\ncentury-long war with the Wainriders, cost Gondor its eastern\nterritories and nearly exterminated the royal family.\n\nIn light of the threats of Angmar and the Wainriders, Gondor and\nArthedain made an alliance in TA 1940, the first such alliance for many\ncenturies, and cemented it by the marriage of Arvedui, heir to the\nthrone of Arthedain, and Fíriel, daughter of Ondoher of Gondor. When\nOndoher and his two sons were killed in battle with the Wainriders four\nyears later, Arvedui claimed the now vacant throne of Gondor, by virtue\nof his descent from Isildur and secondarily in right of his wife. Had\nhis claim been accepted, it seems likely that a Reunited Kingdom would\nhave emerged far earlier, and to the advantage of both North and South.\nBut the Council of Gondor, perhaps offended by his assertion of the\nrights of Isildur's descendants in Gondor, and certainly seeing the\nnorthern prince as a weak candidate, instead offered the crown to\nEärnil, the general responsible for victory over the Wainriders and a\ndistant cousin of Gondor's late King. Despite the obvious snub the\nCouncil thus offered to the northern Dúnedain, Eärnil II maintained\nGondor's alliance with Arthedain, going so far as to send an\nexpeditionary force north to help Arvedui (who had by then succeeded his\nfather) against Angmar; but that fleet arrived too late to save\nArthedain, instead providing the bulk of the forces that would smash\nAngmar at Fornost. In that encounter, Eärnur, Eärnil's son and eventual\nsuccessor, was personally humiliated by the Witch-king. When therefore\nthe Nazgûl had conquered Minas Ithil (TA 2002), and Eärnur succeeded his\nfather, the Witch-king, appealing to his pride, challenged him to single\ncombat; he rode to the gates of Minas Morgul (as Minas Ithil had been\nrenamed) with a small retinue and was never seen or heard from again.\n\nThus, within two generations of the Dúnedain, both Arnor and Gondor lost\ntheir kings. The northern Dúnedain were too weak to maintain a kingdom,\nand so their leaders, the successors of Isildur, took the humble title,\n“Chieftain of the Dúnedain”. In the south, by contrast, Gondor was still\na viable state, but the male-line descendants of Anárion were all but\nextinct. Unlike Rhudaur and Cardolan in the north, the Dúnedain of\nGondor refused to look for a king outside the royal family, so power was\nexercised in the name of the king by 26 successive Ruling Stewards, the\nfirst of whom was Mardil the Steadfast. By the time of the later\nStewards, Sauron's forces were constantly encroaching on Gondor's\nborders, and several more territories were ceded to allies or conquered\nby enemies: Calenardhon in the 26th century, and Ithilien, Gondor's sole\nremaining province east of the Anduin, in the 30th. In the War of the\nRing, Sauron sought to smash Gondor, his strongest opponent, but forces\nfrom Gondor and other nations beat his armies back in the Battle of the\nPelennor Fields. During that battle, Aragorn II, the Chieftain of the\nDúnedain of the North, and thus a descendant of both Isildur and\nAnárion, distinguished himself by arriving with a strong relief army at\nthe critical moment, and was acclaimed by the people of Gondor as King;\nhis only notable opponent within Gondor's ruling classes, Ruling Steward\nDenethor II, was driven mad and committed suicide on the day of the\nbattle. Thus, after Sauron was defeated by the destruction of his Ring,\nAragorn was crowned King of Gondor and received the sceptre of the Kings\nof Arnor, becoming the first King of the Reunited Kingdom."

    "page_id": "9906",
    "text": "THORIN AND COMPANY were a group of thirteen Dwarves, the Wizard Gandalf,\nand the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, led by Thorin Oakenshield in TA 2941.\nTheir main purpose was to regain the lost Dwarven kingdom of the Lonely\nMountain from the Dragon Smaug.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nThe formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin\nin Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost\nfamily inheritance. Remembering that he had once known an adventurous\nHobbit on his travels in The Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to\ntheir company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable\nto force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the\nsometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The\nsuperstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number,\nand as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a\nfourteenth to fill in to their party.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nFormation of Thorin and Company\n\nOn the April 26, 2941, Gandalf and the Dwarves arrived at Bag End. After\nbig tea and supper with Bilbo, they explained themselves and their\nintentions. Bilbo was at first reluctant to join the group but Gandalf\nrushed him out of the door.\n\nTravels and Encounters\n\nAfter traveling for some time and crossing the river Hoarwell, the\ncompany were caught and nearly killed and eaten by three hungry trolls.\nGandalf returned in time to keep the monsters occupied until dawn, when\nthe light of the Sun turned them to stone. Recovering themselves, the\nDwarves found that these Trolls had a cave nearby filled with stolen\nweapons, food, and a small treasure. Amongst the many weapons were Sting\n(which Bilbo armed himself with, and which he named after a battle with\na giant spider), Orcrist (claimed by Thorin), and Glamdring (taken by\nGandalf). Strangely, all were ancient Elvish blades that had been forged\nseveral millennia earlier, in the First Age, in Gondolin.\n\n\n\nReaching Rivendell in June, the company held talks with Elrond and\nlearned about the secret Moon-letters on Thorin’s old map of the Lonely\nMountain. Elrond also read the runes on Orcrist and Glamdring, thus\nidentifying them. After spending a short time there, the group resumed\ntheir journey through the Misty Mountains.\n\nOn their way through the High Pass, the company (minus Gandalf) were\ncaptured by goblins. Taken before the Great Goblin, they were in mortal\ndanger. Gandalf suddenly appeared and killed the Great Goblin, creating\nenough disarray for them to escape. Unfortunately, Bilbo fell down a\nhole and was left behind during their hasty retreat. Wandering lost and\nalone in the depths of the mountain, he found the One Ring and met\nGollum, described in _The Hobbit_ as “a small slimy creature … as dark\nas darkness, except for two big round pale eyes in his thin face.”\n\nAfter a hazardous game of Riddles with the creature, Bilbo fortuitously\ndiscovered the ring he had found could make him invisible. Wearing the\nring, Bilbo escaped Gollum and a group of goblins guarding the eastern\ndoor out of the caverns, and soon reunited with his companions.\nCollecting themselves, the company made their way down the mountainside,\nwhere they were attacked by Wargs and forced to seek refuge in the\ntrees. Goblins soon arrived and tried to kill the company by getting\nthem down on the ground by tampering down the trees. With all hope\nnearly gone, the hapless company were rescued by a group of giant\nEagles.\n\nAfter thanking the Eagles, Thorin and Company made for Beorn's house\nwhere they managed to impress the wary shape-changer. Fully stocked and\nprepared the Company, they left Beorn's home and made for Mirkwood. When\nthey reached the edge of the perilous wood, Gandalf announced that he\nhad pressing business elsewhere and would not be coming with them\nthrough the forest. Grumbling, they went on ahead, taking the Forest\nPath into the darkness of Mirkwood. After a few days they reached a dark\nstream which Beorn had warned them not to drink or bathe in, for it was\nenchanted and caused great drowsiness and forgetfulness. They were able\nto cross it, but Bombur fell in. By the time they fished him out he was\nalready asleep and had to be carried by the rest of the company.\n\nEventually they reached a point where they were practically out of food\nand tried to beg from a group of feasting Wood-elves. Thorin was\ncaptured by these Elves, while the remaining company, with the exception\nof Bilbo, were snared by Giant Spiders. Bilbo rescued them with the help\nof his magic ring, but they were soon captured by the angry Elves and\nimprisoned by their king.\n\nWith the aid of the ring, Bilbo eluded the Dwarves' captors. Weeks\nlater, he found a way to free them. Hiding in empty wine barrels, the\ncompany made their way down the river to Lake-town. There they were fed\nand clothed with the hope that they would defeat Smaug and regain\nprosperity for the region.\n\nThey reached the mountain after a few days and tried to locate the\nSecret door described on the map. They found it with the help of a\nThrush. Thorin decided to have Bilbo enter the mountain and “burgle”\nsomething. This the hobbit did, and even had a conversation with the\nmighty Smaug (while wearing the Ring, so that he could not be seen). But\nthe enraged Dragon soon emerged and attacked Lake-town, leaving Thorin\nand Company free to enter the mountain. Meanwhile the dragon was slain\nby Bard of Lake-town, but the town suffered great loss and destruction.\nThe Dwarves remained inside the mountain until an army of Lake-men, and\nlater Wood-elves, led by the Elven-king, arrived seeking a share of the\ntreasure to compensate them for their losses. Thorin refused, and the\nDwarves were besieged within the mountain. They called for aid from\ntheir kin in the Iron Hills (a range to the east of The Lonely\nMountain).\n\nThe Battle of Five Armies and the Dissolving of the Company\n\n\n\nJust before they were about to fight the Elves, the company were joined\nby an army of Dwarves from the Iron Hills. Then Gandalf arrived, just in\ntime to inform them that an army of goblins and Wargs were coming to\nattack. The battle began and Thorin and Company went to war. Bilbo\nstayed out of the battle with the aid of the Ring. The enemy had the\nupper hand until the arrival of the eagles and Beorn. The company and\ntheir allies won but Fíli and Kíli had been killed and Thorin was\nmortally wounded. Bilbo bade farewell to Thorin as he lay dying, and\nthen left with Gandalf and a modest share of the treasure.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe deeds of Thorin and Company led to the restoration of the Dwarven\nKingdom of the Lonely Mountain and the Dwarven dynasty in the Lonely\nMountain, the Kingdom of Dale, the rebuilding of Lake-town, and\nrestoration of peace and prosperity in the immediate area for many\nyears. In the long term, the journey of Thorin and Company and the\nsituations it created led to the Council of Elrond and the formation of\nthe Fellowship of the Ring many years later and played a major part in\nthe starting of The War of the Ring.\n\nIt also depleted the forces of evil so that later Sauron would have less\nto call upon during the War of the Ring. Gloin's son, Gimli, would later\nbe a member of the Fellowship as well, contributing his axe to their\nultimate victory. Additionally, Bilbo's finding of the ring would bring\nit into the care of Frodo, who would one day bring it to its\ndestruction.\n\n\nMembers\n\n-   Thorin II Oakenshield (leader) \n-   Fíli\n-   Kíli\n-   Óin\n-   Glóin\n-   Balin\n-   Dwalin\n-   Ori\n-   Dori\n-   Nori\n-   Bifur\n-   Bofur\n-   Bombur\n-   Bilbo Baggins\n-   Gandalf\n\n  Name      Age (TA 2941)\n  --------- ------------------------\n  Thorin    195\n  Fili      82\n  Kili      77\n  Oín       167\n  Glóin     158\n  Balin     178 (book) 216 (movie)\n  Dwalin    169\n  Ori       76 (movie)\n  Dori      114\n  Nori      104\n  Bifur     127\n  Bofur     98\n  Bombur    107\n  Bilbo     50\n  Gandalf   5000+\n\n  : Age of the Members of the Company\n\n\nAppearances\n\nBook Appearances\n\n-   _The Hobbit_\n\nFilm Appearances\n\n-   _The Hobbit_ (1977)\n-   _The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_ (2012)\n-   _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_ (2013)\n-   _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_ (2014)"

They were sent from Valinor to Middle-earth to keep an eye on\nthe exiled Ñoldor, and also upon their foe the evil Vala Morgoth, and\nlater yet upon Morgoth's lieutenant and future Dark Lord, Sauron.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFirst Age\n\n\n\nThe Great Eagles were the messengers and spies of the King of Arda, and\npossessed the ability to see through all physical matter except for the\nblackness of Morgoth's evil pits. Morgoth first discovered the limits\nof their sight prior to the fall of the great stronghold of Utumno.\n\nFor a time the King of the Eagles, Thorondor, kept his eyries at the top\nof Thangorodrim, the three mighty peaks that Morgoth raised from the\nIron Mountains above the gates of Angband. While they lived there,\nThorondor helped Fingon rescue Maedhros. Thorondor's folk later\nremoved their eyries to the Crissaegrim, part of the Echoriath about\nGondolin. There they were friends of Turgon, and kept spies off the\nmountains.\n\nThorondor wounded Morgoth in the face after Morgoth's battle with\nFingolfin, and carried Fingolfin's corpse to the Echoriath, where Turgon\nburied him.\n\nThe Great Eagles fought alongside the army of the Valar, Elves and Edain\nduring the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age.\n\nSecond Age\n\nIn the Second Age, a pair of Eagles had an eyrie in the King's House in\nArmenelos, the capital of Númenor, until the Kings became hostile to the\nValar. The Eagles also watched the peak of Mount Meneltarma, and three\nEagles would always appear when someone climbed to the summit.\n\nTowards the end of Númenor, the Valar sent storm clouds in the shape of\nGreat Eagles in an attempt to warn them of their folly and impending\ndoom.\n\nThird Age\n\n\n\nIn the Third Age, Thorondor's descendants Gwaihir and Landroval lived in\nan eyrie to the east of the Misty Mountains in Wilderland.\n\nThese Eagles helped the Elves of Rivendell and Radagast in watching the\nland and in gathering news about the Orcs.\n\nIn _The Hobbit_, no eagles were identified by name. Only the title Lord\nof the Eagles distinguished the eagle leader from other eagles in this\nstory. Many readers assume that it was Gwaihir and Landroval who\nrescued Thorin Oakenshield and Company from a band of Wargs and Goblins,\nflying them to the river Anduin, and later assisting in the Battle of\nthe Five Armies fought near Lonely Mountain. However, in Return of\nthe King Gandalf says that Gwaihir has carried him twice before, while\nthe proper count would be three times if Gwaihir and the _Lord of the\nEagle_s were the same individual.\n\n\n\nBefore and during the War of the Ring, Gwaihir rescued Gandalf the Grey\nfrom the top of Isengard—having been dispatched by Radagast—and again\nfrom Zirak-Zigil. The Eagles aided troops of King Elessar at the\nBattle of the Morannon at the Black Gate. The Eagles arrived in time to\noverthrow some Nazgûl, including Khamûl. Gwaihir, with others of his\npeople, rescued Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee from Mount Doom in\nMordor after the One Ring had been destroyed.\n\n\nNotable Great Eagles\n\n-   Thorondor\n-   Gwaihir\n-   Landroval\n-   Meneldor\n\n\nNames\n\nThe Elves have various names for the Eagles, including the Sindarin\n_thoron_ or _thorn_ and the Quenya _soron_.\n\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nTolkien's painting of an eagle on a crag appears in some editions of\n_The Hobbit_. According to Christopher Tolkien, the author based this\npicture on a painting by Archibald Thorburn of an immature Golden Eagle,\nwhich Christopher found for him in _The Birds of the British Isles_ by\nT. A. Coward. However, Tolkien's use of this model does not necessarily\nmean that his birds were ordinary Golden Eagles. In some of his texts\nTolkien speculated that these great Eagles were actually Maiar in\nbird-shape, as he felt it unlikely Ilúvatar would grant feär to animals.\nIf this was true, then Roäc the Raven and the Thrush, who appear in _The\nHobbit_, might also be Maiar or other spirits in animal form (and\npossibly even Beorn, who sometimes takes the form of a bear).\n\n\nOther versions of the legendarium\n\nIn earlier texts, Tolkien once envisioned the Great Eagles as\nbird-shaped Maiar. However, he had remembered that he abandoned the\nconcept of the Children of the Valar, and that Gwaihir and Landroval\nwere descendants of Thorondor during the events of _The Lord of the\nRings_. Eventually, Tolkien decided that the Great Eagles were animals\nthat had been “taught language by the Valar, and raised to a higher\nlevel — but they still had no _fëar_.”\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nPeter Jackson's film trilogies\n\nIn Peter Jackson's film trilogies (those of _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord\nof the Rings_), the Eagles are much smaller than depicted in the book.\nThey have been noted to been around 6m (20ft) tall, and have a wingspan\nof no more than 23m (75ft). Also, in the film adaptations, unlike in the\nbooks, the birds are not shown to be capable of speech. During the\ntitular events of _The Battle of the Five Armies_, the Eagles carry\nRadagast and Beorn into battle against Azog's army; otherwise their role\nin the films is identical to that of the books, though the Eagle that\ncarries Gandalf from Orthanc is summoned by Gandalf and not sent by\nRadagast.\n\nVideo games\n\n-   In _The Lord of the Rings: War in the North_, an eagle named Beleram\n    acts as a supporting character, aiding the players in battle by\n    attacking enemies like Trolls and Uruk-hai."

    "page_id": "12484",
    "text": "LORD OF THE RINGS STRATEGO- TRILOGY EDITION is a two player board game\nbased on the original Stratego game. It was developed in 2004 by Hasbro\nand Milton Bradley with a Lord of the Rings theme and three different\ntypes of gameplay: {“classic” (original Stratego), “special powers”\n(certain characters have powers based on special abilities they\npossessed in the movie), and “Destroy the Ring” (if Frodo Baggins gets\nto a certain square, most of the pieces on the gray side die). (See\nalso: _Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation_.)\n\n\nObject of the game\n\nThe object of the game is to attack the other side's flag, or to kill\nall of the other side's movable pieces. Pieces are faced inward, so that\nthe opposing player cannot see the opponent's pieces. These pieces are\nranked with different numbers, and the higher numbers kill the lower\nnumbers with a few exceptions. These include the Spy (Éowyn or Gríma\nWormtongue) which can be killed by any piece except the ten (Gandalf or\nthe Witch-king). If the Spy attacks the ten, the Spy wins or if the ten\nattacks the Spy, the Spy dies. Also, pieces called Strongholds, which\ncannot move, can kill any piece except 3's (Soldiers of Gondor or Orcs).\nIf a three attacks a Stronghold, then the Stronghold dies. The pieces\nranked 2 (Riders of Rohan or Wrag Riders) can move unlimited spaces\nuntil meeting an opponent and attack.\n\n\nGameboard\n\nThe board in which the game is played is a 10x10 board, containing a\ntotal of 100 squares. Forty beige (good side) pieces go on one side of\nthe board and forty gray (bad side) pieces go on the other side of the\nboard. In between, there are two 4x4 forbidden zones in which no piece\nis allowed to go. Also, the board is depicted as a map of Middle-earth,\nwith a mug and candle covering the forbidden zones.\n\n\nPieces\n\nWhite Pieces\n\nThe white pieces consist of the good characters in the Lord of the Rings\nand include the following:\n\n-   Gandalf (ranked 10)\n-   Aragorn (ranked 9)\n-   Legolas (ranked 8)\n-   Gimli (ranked 8)\n-   Théoden (ranked 7)\n-   Éomer (ranked 7)\n-   Faramir (ranked 7)\n-   Boromir (ranked 6)\n-   Arwen (ranked 6)\n-   Treebeard (ranked 6)\n-   Haldir (ranked 6)\n-   Elf (group of four pieces ranked 5)\n-   Frodo (ranked 4)\n-   Sam (ranked 4)\n-   Merry (ranked 4)\n-   Pippin (ranked 4)\n-   Soldier of Gondor (group of five pieces ranked 3)\n-   Rider of Rohan (group of eight pieces ranked 2)\n-   Stronghold (group of six non-movable pieces that can kill every\n    piece except 3's)\n-   Éowyn (ranked Spy, meaning that she can kill the 10 on the other\n    side, but any piece can kill her, also called rank 1)\n-   Flag (a non-movable piece depicted as a flag with the White Tree of\n    Gondor on a blue background which, if attacked, wins the game for\n    the gray side)\n\nGray Pieces\n\nThe Gray Pieces consist of the bad characters in the Lord of the Rings\nand include the following:\n\n-   The Witch-king of Angmar (ranked 10)\n-   Saruman (ranked 9)\n-   Ringwraith (group of two pieces ranked 8)\n-   Gothmog (ranked 7)\n-   Lurtz (ranked 7)\n-   Sharku (ranked 7)\n-   Uruk-hai (group of four pieces ranked 6)\n-   Berserker (group of four pieces ranked 5)\n-   Haradrim (group of four pieces ranked 4)\n-   Orc (group of five pieces ranked 3)\n-   Warg Rider (group of eight pieces ranked 2)\n-   Stronghold (group of six non-movable pieces that can kill any piece\n    except 3's)\n-   Gríma Wormtongue (ranked Spy, meaning that he can kill the ten on\n    the other side, but he can be killed by any piece)\n-   Flag (a non-movable piece depicted as a flag with the eye of Mordor\n    on a black background, which, if attacked, wins the game for the\n    white side)\n\n\nTypes of Gameplay\n\nClassic\n\nThe classic mode of playing is that each piece moves one space to attack\na piece of a different colour. Higher pieces kill lower pieces, with\ncertain exceptions stated above.\n\nSpecial Powers\n\nIn the Special Powers mode of playing, certain pieces can perform\nspecial moves.\n\nBeige Side\n\nOn the beige side, pieces that have special powers include the\nfollowing:\n\n-   Gandalf (10)- Flight (with the help of the Great Eagles, Gandalf can\n    go over other pieces and forbidden zones and land on an empty space)\n-   Aragorn (9)- Detect Enemy (with his Ranger skills, Aragorn can look\n    at pieces up to two spaces away)\n-   Legolas (8)- Longbow and Detect Enemy (with his elven skills,\n    Legolas can shoot and look at pieces up to two spaces away)\n-   Gimli (8)- Dwarven Axe (with his dwarven skills and axe, Gimli can\n    attack three adjacent pieces at once)\n-   Faramir (7)- Longbow (with his Gondorian bow, Faramir can kill\n    pieces up to two spaces away)\n-   Théoden (7)- Swift Speed (with his horse from Rohan, King Théoden\n    can go two spaces at once)\n-   Elf (5)- Longbow (with their elven skills, the (elves can kill enemy\n    pieces up to two spaces away)\n\nGray Side\n\nOn the gray side, pieces that have special powers include the following:\n\n-   Witch-king (10)- Flight (with his Fell Beast, the Witch-king can go\n    over other pieces and forbidden zones and land on an empty space)\n-   Saruman (9)- Detect Enemy (with his wizardry skills, Saruman can\n    look at pieces up to two spaces away)\n-   Uruk-Hai (6)- Repeat Attack (with their advanced training in\n    warfare, the Uruk-Hai can attack one piece after another until they\n    die)\n-   Berserker (5)- Rampage (with their fierce techniques in fighting,\n    Berserkers can kill all adjacent pieces next to them , but die in the process) Berserkers are also immune to\n    Longbow attacks.\n-   Haradrim (4)- Longbow (with their bows, Haradrim can kill pieces up\n    to two spaces away)\n\nDestroy the Ring\n\nIn the Destroy the Ring mode of playing, Frodo must go to the top-left\ncorner of the forbidden zone, from the good side's point of view. When\nhe gets there, all pieces ranked 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 on the bad side\ndie. However, flag must still be reached after the Ring is destroyed,\nthough. In Destroy the Ring mode, Frodo has one special power:\nRing-bearer. Ring-bearer makes Frodo impossible to kill except by the\nWitch-king (10) or the Ringwraiths (8)."

    "page_id": "14079",
    "text": "The ANGMAR WAR was a centuries-long struggle between the Northern\nDúnedain kingdom of Arnor (mainly Arthedain) and the forces of Angmar,\nled by the Witch-king of Angmar.\n\n\nHistory\n\nAfter 1000 years of peace that followed the Battle of the Last Alliance,\nevil once more began to spread across Middle-earth. In the year 1300 of\nthe Third Age, evil things started to stir in Middle-earth again, and\nthe Nazgûl re-appeared. The Witch-king settled in Angmar with its\ncapital city at Carn Dûm, and after having built an army there, invades\nArnor in the year TA 1409, and wages a war lasting nearly 500 years\nagainst the Kingdom of Arnor, the Northern-Kingdom of Men. The tower of\nAmon-Sûl is destroyed, but the great fortress of Fornost is defended,\nand war continues. After the Great Plague in TA 1636 which devastates\nGondor and desolates many parts of Eriador, the southern part of Arnor,\nthe Witch-King finally destroys Fornost TA 1974, and takes it as his own\nfortress.\n\nKing Eärnur of Gondor, after receiving a message from Arnor from help\nfinally arrived with a formidable force and defeated the forces the\nWitch-king at the Battle of Fornost. Despite the victory of the allies\non the field, the already divided Kingdom of Arnor fell but its remnants\ncontinues under the leadership of the Chieftain of the Dúnedain.\n\n\nPortrayal in adaptations\n\nVideo games\n\n_The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the\nWitch-king_ tells a zoomed-in and thorough story of the evil\nWitch-king's rise to power, domination of Angmar and invasion of the\ngreat Kingdom of Arnor. In the campaign, the player must dominate the\nland of Angmar, gather a huge army, and then launch a massive invasion\nthat will span half a millennium in Middle-earth's history.\n\nCampaign Storyline\n\nThese battles were seen in the campaign of _The Rise of the Witch-king_.\n\nFoundations of Angmar\n\nThe Witch-king and Morgomir arrive at a barren land to the North near\nthe Ettenmoors. They immediately notice a relatively intelligent\nwarrior-troll, Rogash, and recruit him on the promise that they will\nreunite the Snow and Hill-Trolls. These three Angmar Champions rush to\nthe fighting Trolls, and the Witch-king fulfills his promise to Rogash\nand unites them. The Witch-king orders the foundation of three mighty\nAngmar fortresses while his armies eliminate the Black Númenóreans in\nthe area, freeing other trolls in the process. Soon after, a great army\nof Black Númenóreans arrive to eliminate the intruders, but the\nWitch-king and his troll army easily overcome them. The Witch-king\nforces the allegiance of the Black Númenóreans, and Angmar is\nsuccessfully founded.\n\nFall of Rhudaur\n\nA group of Hill-men of Rhudaur begin to rebel against Arnor, led by\nHwaldar. Hwaldar is seized and arrested, but Morgomir recognizes a\nvaluable ally to control the Hill-men of Rhudaur. The Witch-king and his\narmy eliminate the Loyalists and recruit the rebels. Soon after, they\ndestroy the Dúnedain guarding Hwaldar and free him. They then proceed to\nattack the mighty Arnor fortresses in Rhudaur, but the attack (while\nsuccessful on one fortress) weakens the Angmar forces badly and King\nArgeleb I soon arrives to finish them off. Morgomir brilliantly trains\nthe Thrall Masters to replenish the Angmar army and wipe out King\nArgeleb and his army. They then destroy the other fortress, claiming\ntotal control over Rhudaur.\n\nInvasion of Amon Sûl\n\nFurther invasions from Angmar are thwarted by King Arveleg I, who uses\nthe Palantír of Amon Sul to foresee attacks. To proceed in Arnor's\ndestruction, the Witch-king must destroy Amon Sûl and claim the\nPalantír.\n\nRogash, Hwaldar, Morgomir, and the Witch-king are all involved in this\nbattle. The forces of darkness start off by destroying five Mallorn\ntrees that power various defenses of Amon Sûl. After they are destroyed,\nthey proceed in destroying the main fortress. Reinforcements of Arnor\nlater arrive, but the enemy wipes them out completely. The Angmar forces\nturn back towards Amon Sûl and begin destroying the structures in the\nfortress despite heavy resistance. Angmar eventually summons two\nMountain Giants and proceeds to attack the watchtower, destroying it\nonce and for all.\n\nThough Angmar has destroyed Amon Sûl, Arveleg has escaped with the\nPalantír. The Witch-King sends Morgomir to retrieve it.\n\nDark Lord's Eye\n\nA small Angmar scout party sent by Morgomir pursues Arveleg. The Dire\nwolves make a mad rush for King Arveleg, while the Thrall Masters summon\nGundabad Orcs to attack the Tower Guards. The combined forces\nsuccessfully wear down Arveleg, but before he is killed he smashes the\nPalantír, causing a huge explosion killing everything nearby.\n\nMorgomir and more powerful forces later arrive and notice a shard of the\nPalantír, which is still filled with power. Arnor also notices it and\nsends orders to retrieve it. Angmar and Arnor compete and race for\nmastery of the shards, partially since both of their powers have been\nnullified by the blast and are regenerated with the Palantír shards.\nAngmar gets most of them, but when Arnor brings some to their outpost\nMorgomir and his forces destroy the outpost. After the Arnor outpost is\ndestroyed, Morgomir easily gathers the seven shards and gains victory\nfor Angmar.\n\nBarrow Downs\n\nCardolan wasn't affected by the destruction of Amon Sûl so the\nWitch-king attacks the Barrow Downs, planning to draw out Cardolan's\nforces into a foolish and self-destructive charge. He sends Hwaldar to\nclaim the royal barrow. To assist the conquest, Hwaldar destroys the\nattacking forces and kills some Dúnedain rangers that planned attack the\nreinforcements of Angmar. With him are some Thrall Masters and Sorcerers\nthat have gained power from the Palantír shards. When Hwaldar reaches\nthe Royal Barrow, Cardolan becomes enraged and sends its forces to\ndestroy him. But, the Rhudaur Warriors hold back each attack and the\nSorcerers cripple and destroy Arnor's soldiers, turning some of them\ninto corrupted Wights. As time passes, more Sorcerers, Thrall Masters,\nand Trolls arrive; at one point, Morgomir joins the battle. In the end,\nthe Prince of Cardolan himself arrives to answer the challenge, but so\ndoes the Witch-king and Rogash at the same time. The Prince is\neventually killed by the Witch-King and his forces, and Cardolan is laid\nbare to the enemy.\n\nCarn Dûm\n\nGlorfindel, Elrond and the Elves prepare to lead a charge on the capital\nof Carn Dûm, in an attempt to destroy Angmar and give Arnor time to\nrecover. The Witch-king lights a beacon to call Rogash, and some\nbuilders and Hwaldar begin setting up defenses. By the time the Elves\nattack, Carn Dûm is ready. Despite this, the battle originally goes ill\nfor Angmar as more and more trebuchets and Elves pound on the assault.\nJust as Carn Dûm appears to be taken, Rogash and Morgomir arrive with\narmies of Trolls. With these powerful new reinforcements, Carn Dûm is\nsaved from the Elves. Glorfindel is defeated, but before he can be\nkilled he is rescued by the Elves (later to launch a more successful\ninvasion of Angmar. He is also one of the heroes in the good campaign on\nBattle For Middle Earth 2). In the meantime, however, Angmar is weakened\nbut not destroyed, and the Witch-king continues to plan the next assault\neven as both Angmar and Arnor recuperate.\n\nPlague Bearer\n\nAfter an unsuccessful attack by Men and Elves on the fortress of Carn\nDûm, the Witch-king contemplates his next move. The audacity of his\nenemies angered him greatly, and an example should be made. However,\nAngmar has been significantly weakened, and his next attack needs to be\nplanned in order to prevent failure.\n\nWith the help of Morgomir, he decides to unleash a terrible plague upon\nthe unsuspecting Arnor, created by his Black Númenórean sorcerers. These\nwicked men, already deeply immersed in the Dark Arts, have become even\nmore powerful due to acquiring the shards of the Palantír; their powers\nhave already been demonstrated in the Battle for Cardolan. However, the\nWitch-king needs a ground zero from which his diabolical plague will\nspread. With utter malice, he chooses the most sacred ground in all of\nArnor: the Barrow downs. These quiet and dignified monuments of the\nDúnedain are essential to the morale of Cardolan, which Angmar is\nperfectly aware of.\n\nMorgomir is to lead the attack on the Barrow downs. Cardolan's forces,\noutraged at this desecration, sends its own armies (led by Captain\nCarthaen) to destroy Angmar's forces even as the Sorcerers begin\ncorrupting souls. Morgomir, however, instructs his Sorcerers to cast\ntheir own terrible spells on the Cardolan army, weakening it\nsignificantly. To finalize victory, Morgomir summons a tortured, evil\nice werewolf to crush the opposition. The Sorcerers complete the plague,\nand the Barrow-wights are fully created. Captain Carthaen is soon\ntrapped by the Sorcerers, and Morgomir stabs him with a Morgul-blade.\nAnd so, Karsh the Whisperer is created.\n\nFornost and the Fall of Arnor\n\nAngmar has almost completely dominated Arnor, but Fornost still remains\nto be taken. The Dúnedain and their allies all gather for this final\nassault. In order to prevent a foolish advance (and subsequent\ndestruction), the Witch-king prepares a base and gathers his forces\nfirst. After all the preparations, they begin the assault. Angmar starts\nby destroying the front gate and some of the outer defenses. Combining\nthe fury of the Angmar army and deadly Angmar ice powers, the Witch-King\nslowly wears down the fortress one building at a time. Casualties are\nboth sides are high as the Dúnedain desperately battle for their lives\nand Angmar's army fights in a berserk rage. In the end, the citadel of\nFornost is destroyed and the structure falls. Angmar has achieved\ncomplete victory over Arnor, and has now opened the opportunity for\ncomplete domination of the North."

    "text": "ERADAN son of Baranor was one of the Rangers of the North during the\nlate Third Age.\n\n\nBiography\n\nEradan was one of the Rangers of the North, secret protectors of the\nlands once ruled by their ancestors. The life of a Ranger is a hard one\nand to survive Eradan had to master many techniques and skills. Always\noutnumbered, he learned evasion tactics, allowing him to take enemies by\nsurprise or to escape from a tight spot. He was also a master archer,\nable to bring down foes from afar, and when stealth and archery were of\nno avail, he was more than capable with his weapons and shields. Eradan\nfought alongside Andriel, Farin and Beleram during the War of the\nRing.\n\n\nAppearance in adaptations\n\nEradan was created for _The Lord of the Rings: War in the North,_ and\nwas presumably named after the canonical Eradan.\n\nHistory\n\nIn _War in the North_ Eradan and his two companions: Andriel and Farin\nare the three heroes that battle Sauron's forces massing in the North,\nunder Agandaur.\n\nEradan and his companions are first seen arriving in the town of Bree,\nwhere they meet up with Aragorn at the Prancing Pony Inn. They tell him\nthat they had come from the Dúnedain encampment of Sarn Ford, where they\nand their fellow rangers led by Halbarad, are attacked by nine Black\nRiders. After they had slaughtered the rangers, it was then that\nAgandaur had arrived and met with the Witch King, telling him that he\nhas gathered his army of orcs at the old city of Fornost. Aragorn tells\nthem to head straight for Fornost, telling them that the host gathered\nthere could be perilous to his mission (the mission to meet with the\nHobbit, Frodo Baggins, and bring him to Rivendell).\n\nAt Fornost, Eradan, Andriel and Farin are attacked by hordes of goblins\nand orcs. They also free a Great Eagle named Beleram, and join with\nElladan and Elrohir, the twin sons of Lord Elrond. Eventually, the group\narrives at the citadel in the center of the city, where Agandaur is\nbased. Before Eradan and his companions can confront Agandaur, they are\nattacked by the orc chieftain Tharzog and his guards. They eventually\nkill Tharzog, and confront Agandaur at the top of the citadel, who has\noverpowered the elf twins, but he escapes on a Fell beast. Despite\npursuit from Beleram, Agandaur still evades them by calling upon a storm\nwith his power of sorcery.\n\nEradan, Andriel and Farin return to the encampment at Sarn Ford, where\nthey tell Halbarad what had transpired at Fornost. As Eradan and his\ncompanions make ready to leave for Rivendell, at the elf twins' behest,\nHalbarad asks them if they could search for two of his missing rangers:\nLuin and Kilaran, who ended up lost in the Barrow-downs. Eradan politely\nagrees. Once there, however, they are attacked by the Barrow-wights, the\nundead spirits that haunt the tombs of the Downs. As they venture\nthrough the tombs, they eventually find Luin, who tells them that the\nwights have taken Kilaran. They eventually find Kilaran, who is\npossessed by a Barrow-wight Lord. Despite Eradan's protests of killing a\nfellow ranger, he eventually kills him, thereby killing the Wight Lord,\nas well. Eradan and the others offer to help Luin bring Kilaran's body\nback to Sarn Ford and bury him, but Luin says he will take care of\nhimself. And so, Eradan and his companions can continue on their way.\n\nThey eventually arrive at Rivendell, where they meet Lord Elrond and\nAragorn, as well as Gandalf the Grey. They tell Eradan and his friends\nabout Aragorn's quest, which was to bring four Hobbits from the\nShire here to Rivendell, one of them carrying Isildur's Bane (the One\nRing). To that end, they told them that they had a plan to form a\nfellowship of Nine Walkers who would journey to Mordor and destroy the\nRing; Gandalf and Aragorn are already members. Eradan and his friends\nwish to join as well, but Elrond tells them that the choices have\nalready been made. Elrond does, however, tell them that they could help\nhim with a problem arising in the Ettenmoors, to which Eradan and his\nfriends gladly accept.\n\nBefore leaving for the Ettenmoors, Eradan meets Frodo Baggins, the\nHobbit who carries the One Ring. He also meets Legolas, one of the\nwood-elves; Gimli the dwarf and his father Gloin; Bilbo Baggins, Frodo's\nuncle; and lady Arwen Evenstar, Lord Elrond's daughter, who has promised\nherself to Lord Aragorn. Eradan and his companions also bring to Elrond\na scroll they found in Fornost made by a group of dark sorcerers called\nThe Cult of the Lidless Eye, which contain writings of the Black Speech.\nThey also give him a tome, which is revealed to belong to Malbeth, the\nseer of Arthedain.\n\nAs they soon arrive at the Ettenmoors, they are in no time at all\nattacked by orcs and mountain-trolls. They soon are met once again by\nBeleram, who tells them he has come to the Ettenmoors to help his kin\ntrack down a renegade stone giant named Bargrisar. After killing off\nmany orcs, Eradan and his companions eventually find Bargrisar and, with\nBeleram's aid, defeat him. After the giant is killed, Beleram's master,\nLord Gwaihir, arrives. He thanks the heroes for their help, and agrees\nto let Beleram journey with them, along with two other eagles Baranthor\nand Armenel.\n\nWhen they return to Rivendell, Eradan and his friends bring to him war\ngear they had taken from their fallen enemies, which bare Agandaur's\nblack raven emblem. They also tell Elrond that Agandaur is marshalling\nan army, to which Elrond believes that if he were to build an army, he\nwould have gone to Mount Gundabad."

    "page_id": "20269",
    "text": "_MORDIRITH, THE FALSE KING, STEWARD OF CARN DUM_ is a character created\nspecifically for The Lord of the Rings Online. He served as the Steward\nof Angmar during the War of the Ring, as well as his emissary after the\nFall of Fornost. He is the final boss when raiding the Carn Dûm\ninstance. A Wraith, he used to be a Man before the Witch-king of Angmar\ntransformed him into an evil being.\n\n\nOrigins\n\nMordirith was not always evil. He started as Eärnur, the Witch-king's\ngreatest foe. A powerful captain and last king of Gondor before its\ndecline, Eärnur led armies against nearly impossible odds, but in the\nend defeated Angmar though too late to save Arthedain and Arvedui.\nSeveral years after the battle the Witch-king sent him a challenge to a\npersonal duel, which he refused, but seven years later it was sent\nagain, calling him a coward. Eärnur had not forgotten the Witch-king's\ntaunting during the Battle of Fornost, and he rode with a small company\nto Minas Morgul.\n\nHe and his company were never seen again. In The Lord of the Rings\nOnline he was turned into a Wraith, presumably by the Witch-king's\nMorgul-blade. He was sent to a rebuilt Angmar to rule as the\nWitch-king's right hand and steward.\n\n\nMagic\n\nMordirith was bound by a dark magic, making him a Wraith of darkness,\npersonally answerable to the Witch-king. This Wraith-state meant he was,\nlike the Nazgûl, suspended between life and death. On defeat he would\nalways reshape in Minas Morgul and be reclothed to return. His powers\nwere much like his master's from whom he claimed to receive his\nstrength: He could summon and quench flames, create wraiths of his own,\ninspire debilitating terror, see far with his mind, repel any magic that\ncame against him, weave powerful illusions, dominate lesser minds and\nbecome invisible (though as the steward of Angmar he rarely did the\nlatter). He was also adept at politics, strategical warfare and\ninfluencing susceptible minds.\n\nHis presence and efforts were a great hindrance to the warriors of\nMiddle-earth as they fought him during the War of the Ring.\n\n\nPart in the War\n\nMordirith's part in the War was extremely straightforward: Raise an army\nto devastate Eriador, and then march on Gondor to meet with his dark\nmaster at the Battle of Minas Tirith, overwhelming the White Tower. At\nfirst, he did his part well, making alliances with many groups such the\nBlackwolds, Southrons, Ongburz orcs, and Wights of all kinds. He was not\nwithout foes, however, the greatest among these being, Lorniel, Laerdan,\nand the game's protagonist, the Player.\n\nThe Player first came into direct conflict with him when he entered\nAngmar just before the Fellowship left Rivendell. There he met up with\nLorniel and Laerdan, who were chiefs of a hidden group of rangers in\nthat kingdom. Lorniel and the Player attacked Mordirith at Carn Dûm via\na secret route, but were defeated by his power. The Player escaped with\nthe prisoner Golodir, whose mind was broken and would weigh down the\nrangers, but Lorniel (who was, in fact, Golodir's daughter) was killed\nat the Gate.\n\nMordirith was confident of his victory but still prepared for an attack\nby a vengeful Golodir and the Player. He did not expect, however, for\nGolodir to wield a weapon such as the Rivendell-forged sword Dunachar\nand was overcome by its mighty light, the Player's prowess, and his own\noverconfidence. Though the blade broke in the effort, it pierced\nMordirith's chestplate and delivered a fatal blow. After Mordirith's\nfirst defeat his Palantír and stewardship were claimed by Amarthiel,\nChampion of Angmar.\n\nHis spirit driven to Minas Morgul, Mordirith begged his master for\nforgiveness and a chance to exact his revenge, but was bidden to wait.\nThe Witch-king waited and watched as Amarthiel led Angmar as its new\nsteward, but she was more intent on reclaiming her lost Narchuil, one of\nthe Lesser Rings of Power, than on ruling Angmar effectively. When her\nineptitude nearly caused Angmar's downfall at the Player's hands,\nMordorith was sent back to resume his rule. Amarthiel then refused to\ngive up her new station and attempted to use Narchuil's power on\nMordirith. He defeated her and allowed his servant Mordrambor to take\nboth Narchuil and her place as Angmar's new Champion. He quickly\nrestored Angmar to its former glory and launched assaults across\nEriador, believing that without Dunachar no one could stop him.\n\nAmarthiel, who had been thrown down from her position as Stewardess of\nAngmar, repented and reclaimed her old Elven name Narmeleth, once again\njoining the Free Peoples of Middle-earth. Together with the Player she\nreceived a broken Dunachar from Golodir. The two snuck into the caverns\nbeneath Barad Gularan, and in a great fury attacked Mordirith. During\nthe battle the Steward of Carn Dûm summoned many illusions of prominent\ncasualties from her reign as Amarthiel, including her own father Laerdan\nand her caretaker Sara Oakheart. Narmeleth eventually she lost her will\nto fight. Believing his victory to be complete, Mordirith finally ceased\nhis illusions and showed his true form, throwing a fatally wounded\nNarmeleth to the floor. Mordirith gloated that no one would remember\nNarmeleth, but that the name Amarthiel would forever live on in history\nas a great Hero of Angmar, as would her father; Laerdan the Fool who\ncaused Eriador's downfall. Enraged by his words, Narmeleth used\nDunachar's broken hilt to stab Mordirith in the empty hood of his robes,\nending his second reign. Narmeleth died of her wounds shortly after.\n\n\nNotes\n\nMordirith was not in books or the films and was a character created\nsolely for _The Lord of the Rings Online_ as a boss character."

    "text": "The FIRST SACK OF DORIATH, or the SACK OF MENEGROTH, was an attack on\nDoriath by the Dwarves of Nogrod in the late First Age.\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe cause of the attack was the Dwarves' desire to possess the Silmaril,\nset in the dwarven-made jewel, the Nauglamir, for themselves. After the\ntwo treasures were brought together, Thingol sought to take it and set\nabout it his neck but the Dwarves withheld it from him, saying that he\nhadn't the right to do so as it was a dwarven heirloom taken from\nNargothrond by theft. Then in a gesture of great pride, Thingol scorned\nthe dwarves as inferiors undeserving in comparison to himself and\nproceeded to speak ill of them, deeming they should be gone out of his\nrealm forever. Insulted and ever wanting the Silmaril, the Dwarves'\nhearts kindled to rage and they fell upon him and there was a great\nbattle within the palace, Thingol was seemingly defeated, and took the\nNauglamir and the Silmaril, but were driven out of the fortress.\n\nThe Dwarves left Menegroth, but it didn't take long for the alarm to be\nraised on what had been done, and soon all of Doriath was roused. With\ngreat wrath, the dwarves were pursued to the death and all but two\nreturned home to Nogrod. When they arrived, the survivors lied about\nwhat really happened, saying that their brothers had been slain at the\ncommand of the Thingol, hoping to cheat them of their reward. The\nDwarves of Nogrod then became filled will wrath and desired revenge.\nThey tried to get the Dwarves of Belegost to help them but they refused.\n\nLater the Dwarves were allowed past the Girldle with the help of\ntreacherous elves who were under the curse of the treasure. Meanwhile\nThingol was lured out of the fortress on a hunt with only a small\ncompany of arms. The dwarves were waiting for him an ambush finally slew\nthe king, and the fortress of the THousand Caves was taken unawares and\nplundered, bringing well nigh to ruin the glory of Doriath.\n\nMelian, full of grief and pain at the loss of her husband and seeing\nthat that the doom she had so feared had finally come upon Doriath,\nwithdrew her protection of the realm. The dwarves could neither harm nor\nseize her and she went forth...\n\nHere there is a split in the accounts...\n\nIn Beren and Luthien (2017) to sought after Beren and Luthien, to warn\nhem of the Dwarves approach. Giving them a chance with help of the\nGreen Elves to stop the Dwarves at the battle of the Stony Ford. Melien\nalso tells Beren the dangers of the Mim's cursed treasure, and has\ndiscussions with her daughter Luthien. She gives the Silmaril to Beren\nfor safe keeping. In time Luthien faded, and Beren died, and their son\nDior became heir to Doriath (taking the Silmaril with him) and helped\nraise its glory anew, though Melian dwelt in that place, and she\nreturned back to and of the Gods.\n\nAlternatively another somewhat later account (closer to how it appears\nin The Silmarillion (1977)) Dior leaves later while his family was still\nalive and become the new king of Doriath. It was when Green Elves\nbrought him a coffer with the Necklace of the Dwarves, that he knew his\nparents had died. He stared at the Silmaril long with grief that death\nhad come upon his parents so soon.\n\nIn the Silmarillion (1977), the co-author Guy Kay was tasked with coming\nup with an explanation for why the girdle/veil of Melian was brought\ndown to allow dwarves back into the city to sack it. It is not clear how\nmuch of it was J.R. Tolkiens ideas and how much of it was Guy Kay's but\nUnfinished Tales and HoMe series attribute much of that chapter as a\nconstruction of Kays.\n\nIn the story as it appears in Of the Sacking of Doriath, she entrusted\nMablung to send word to Beren at Tol Galen and gave him the Silmaril for\nsafe-keeping. She then left Middle-earth and returned to Valinor leaving\nDoriath vulnerable.\n\nAs per HoMe Christopher Tolkien mentions never being fully happy with\nhaving used a construction (that was not wholly of his fathers) and in\nhindsight and with discovery of later works of his father (which\nincluded the intent to go back and incorporate much of the elements of\nthe earlier stories), he admits he could have retained much the elements\nof both accounts, with very little editorial involvement (and should\nhave included the extended parts of the story). In the 2017 Beren and\nLuthien work, he has reached that goat to a certain degree.\n\n\n\n\nThe Attack\n\nThe Dwarves of Nogrod assembled a great host and marched out of the Blue\nMountains, crossing the river Gelion, and headed westward to Doriath.\nCrossing the Aros River, the Dwarves reached Doriath with no magical\nenchantments (i.e. the Girdle of Melian) or barriers to stop them. The\nElven sentinels and their captains there were no match for them, and\nwere quickly defeated; then with few losses the Dwarves passed over the\ngreat Bridge of Menegroth, and entered the caves thus beginning the\nBattle of the Thousand Caves. After fierce fighting in which many on\nboth sides were killed, they were victorious and pillaged, plundered,\nand destroyed at their leisure and much was taken from the Great Hall of\nThingol. Then, they came to the the treasury and slew Mablung before its\ndoors and took the Nauglamir and the Silmaril.\n\n\nAfterwards\n\nThe Dwarves left Doriath but didn't live to enjoy the fruits of their\nvictory. At Sarn Athrad, they were ambushed by an army of Laiquendi led\nby Beren with his son Dior. The Dwarven host, heavily weighed-down with\nloot, were destroyed and the survivors that fled into the forest ran\ninto the Ents and were killed. The Silmaril and Nauglamir were taken by\nBeren to Tol Galen. This marked the end of the first kingdom of Doriath\nuntil Dior and his wife Nimloth came to refounded it later ruling over\nthe surviving Sindar, soon afterwards.\n\n\nReferences"

    "text": "The WAINRIDER WAR was a war between the Easterling Wainriders with their\nallies and Gondor with its Northmen allies.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nIn the more than 600 years following Minalcar's defeat of the\nEasterlings in TA 1248, the Easterling tribes of Rhûn were no longer a\nthreat as Gondor ruled the lands of the east all the way to the shores\nof the Sea of Rhûn, and Gondor now had the loyalty of the Northmen of\nRhovanion. While during this long period, Gondor switched its\nterritorial ambitions to the south and built a great naval fleet that\nruled the seas. However, the hatred of the Dúnedain and the Men of\nGondor survived in the remaining tribes apparently living further east\nbut the reasons for the unification and attack of these hostile\nEasterling tribes is not known. The only thing that is known is that it\nmust have happened before TA 1851 with no doubt great preparation and\nplanning.\n\nInvasion Begins and Gondor Defeated\n\nIn TA 1851, the Wainriders fell upon Gondor and the realm of\nRhovanion causing much destruction and leaving many dead especially\namongst the Northmen. After five years of attacks, Gondor finally\nassembled an army led by King Narmacil II himself. The battle was lost\nand King Narmacil was slain in it as was his faithful Northman ally\nMarhari. Afterwards, Gondor lost its eastern lands and the realm of\nRhovanion was occupied and enslaved.\n\nRule of the Wainriders\n\nFor forty-five long years, the Wainriders ruled in Rhovanion where they\nbuilt homes, settlements, outposts, and storehouses most likely with the\nuse of forced labor. They also no doubt had freedom of movement between\ntheir conquests in the west and Rhûn that they never had had before,\nwithout opposition from Gondor or anyone else.\n\nThe Beginnings of the Éothéod\n\nAlthough most of the Northmen of the former realm of Rhovanion fell into\nslavery, some survivors of the sack and people made into fugitives by\nthe Wainrider's takeover followed Marhwini, the son of the Marhari\nnorthwest into the Vales of Anduin where they settled. Out of these\npeople came the Éothéod, who opposed the invaders and maintained\nfriendship with Gondor. Surviving the Wainriders rule, they somehow knew\nof the Wainrider's plans and found out that they had grown hunger from\nmore conquests and that there was great hatred of the Wainriders in\nthose that they ruled. By TA 1899, they knew of their plans to attack\nthe Gondor province of Calenardhon from over the Undeeps and gave that\ninformation to the Gondor. They also planned to rouse and assist a\nrebellion in Rhovanion when such an attack begun.\n\nThe Tables Turn\n\nAs the Wainriders prepare for war, the Gondor king Calimehtar sent a\ngreat host against them from out of North Ithilien. With this, the\nWainrider's plans for Calenardhon changed and they sent all against\nGondor. This worked in Gondor's favor as it allowed for the two foes to\nmeet with all force in one place instead of many, leaving the Undeeps\nundefended. Gondor and its Éothéod allies took quick advantage of this\nand sent their own cavalry over the Undeeps, meant to attack the enemy\nfrom behind. The two armies met in Dagorlad, and the Wainriders were\ndefeated with Marhwini's _éored_'''s ''support and with Gondor's cavalry\nassailing them from behind.\n\nThe Wainrider's defeat led to an uprising in Rhovanion by the slaves but\nthe Wainriders were not completely expelled from the west, as they still\nremained in Rhovanion due to the slow progress of the slave rebellion.\nThe Éothéod also continued to harass them from the northwest as well.\nNever-the-less, it was the beginning of the end to the Wainriders hold\non the west.\n\nA New Threat\n\nFor forty-five more years, the Easterling Wainriders were still a\nproblem despite their losses in the west and plotted a new campaign.\nNeeding more support to recoup their losses and defeat Gondor, they\nformed alliances with the Men of Harad and those of Khand. Once again,\nthe Éothéod again warned Gondor of this new threat to the west. In the\nmonth of Cermië of TA 1944, war resumed with the Wainrider alliance\nthreatening Gondor from both the north and the south. Ondoher prepared\nto meet the enemy in the north while Eärnil, his most trusted captain of\narmies prepared to face them in the south.\n\nThe King marched his army out of Ithilien intending to fight the enemy\nonce again on the Dagorland, but is driven to the Black Gate by\nWainriders from Rhovanion and a combined Wainrider/Khand army from Rhûn\ntraveling along the Ash Mountains to battle. There King Ondoher was\nutterly defeated losing his life and his two sons: Artamir and Faramir.\nThere were some survivors of the defeat that scattered south but field\nwas lost.\n\nThe Wainriders occupied Northern Ithilien was no opposition setting up\ncamps. Here, the victors celebrated believing Gondor was at last\ndefeated but it was not true for Eärnil's smaller but well led Southern\nArmy defeated an army of Haradrim in Southern Ithilien, and proceeded to\nmarch north to face the Wainriders. He met up with some of the\nretreating troops of Ondoher's defeated army and fell upon the\nWainrider's camp in a surprise attack. The Wainrider's were completely\ndefeated in a great rout. Those Wainriders that didn't escape back to\nRhûn died in the Dead Marshes. The war was over.\n\nAfterwards\n\nThe Wainrider threat was over and the Northmen realm in Rhovanion was\ncompletely freed and cleared of the invaders and some of these Men\nmigrated to Gondor where they were welcome as distant brethren. In\nTA 1945, Eärnil was crowned King of Gondor. The Éothéod also\nmaintained friendship with Gondor. Gondor's policy switched to\naiding Arnor in the defeat of Angmar.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe Wainrider War led to a series of events that created the Éothéod who\nlater became the Rohirrim. Their long friendship with Gondor led to the\nlater Oath of Eorl taken by their Lord and later King Eorl the Young\nafter coming to the aid of another war against another Easterling\nthreat, and the afterwards granting of Calenardhon to his people which\nafterwards became Rohan.\n\n\nReferences"

    "text": "The DUEL IN DOL GULDUR is a battle that took place in Dol Guldur between\nSauron and Gandalf. After investigating the tombs of the Nazgûl in the\nHigh Fells of Rhudaur, Gandalf entered the old fortress of Dol Guldur\nand bring forth the evil. That was when he was ambushed by strange\nfigure who was revealed to be Thrain, son of Thrór and father of Thorin\nOakenshield. Gandalf saved him bu removing the insanity and planned to\nget him out of the fortress. However, their efforts came to late when\nthey were ambushed by Azog and group of Guldur Orcs that prevented them\nfrom escaping. Gandalf and Thrain managed to elude them, but they both\nencountered the Sauron, who killed Thrain and managed to beat Gandalf.\nAfter subduing the wizard, Sauron revealed himself, much to Gandalf's\nhorror.\n\n\nBiography\n\nPrelude\n\n In TA 2941, Gandalf was forced to abandon Company of\nThorin Oakenshield near the borders of Mirkwood and travel to the High\nFells of Rhudaur, the eastern part of Arnor. After leaving the Company,\nGandalf reaches the High Fells, revealed to be a chamber built\nprecariously into the side the a mountain and barred by an iron gate,\nwhich has been ripped open violently. As Gandalf steps inside, he slips\nand begins sliding down a slanted chute leading to a bottomless chasm,\nnearly falling to his death but managing to land on a narrow staircase\nbuilt into the wall at the base of the chute just in time. It is\nimmediately revealed that High Fells was neither meant to be found nor\nleft once entered, but Gandalf continues his descent down into the\ndarkness nonetheless. He managed to reach one of the a chamber built\ninto the wall whose iron gate has also been crudely smashed, where it is\nrevealed to hold a tomb whose massive stone lid broken has been broken\nin two from the inside and now lies empty.\n\nWhile trying to solve this alone, Gandalf was startled by the sudden\nappearance of Radagast, who questions why they have chosen to meet in\nthe High Fells. There, Gandalf went on to reveal much of the tombs and\nthat the chamber had been designed to hold a being whose name has long\nbeen forgotten, and would be known only as a “servant of evil.” Gandalf\nthen shines his staff down the chasm to reveal the presence of eight\nsimilar chambers, all similarly broken out of by their captors,\nindicating that the chamber is the prison of the Nazgûl, the nine\nservants of the Dark Lord Sauron. As they left the Fells, Gandalf and\nRadagast discuss the Nazgûl's reawakening, and Gandalf asserts that they\nhave been summoned to Don Goldur by the Necromancer. When Radagast\nasserts that no human sorcerer could possess such powerful dark magic,\nGandalf relays his growing suspicion that the Necromancer is actually\nSauron in disguise, but was still too weak to assume his true form, as\nthe Nazgûl only answer to their one true master. When Gandalf decided to\nreturn to the dwarven company and meet them at the slopes of Erebor,\nRadagast insists that they must investigate Dol Guldur at once. Gandalf\ncounters that the dwarves are in great danger without him, but Radagast\nreminds him that if Sauron has indeed returned, the entire world would\nsoon be in great danger.\n\nEncounter with Thrain\n\nReluctantly convinced by Radagast's words, the two wizards arrive near\nthe entrance of Dol Guldur. Radagast seems uncertain that the fortress\nis occupied, but Gandalf immediately recognises that a spell of\nconcealment lies on the Hill of Sorcery. Before entering the fortress\nhimself, Gandalf ordered Radagast to warn Galadriel of their discovery.\nRadagast warned him that it could be a trap, but Gandalf denied and\nenters the fortress at once. Upon entering, Gandalf began to chant\nspells in Quenya to bring forth all hidden evil and remove the shroud of\nconcealment. While Azog and his army remained hidden, Gandalf continued\nto investigate deep in the abandoned fortress, but that was not until he\nencountered a strange diminished figure who had been following the\nwizard. The figure was known to be an insane dwarf and jumped down onto\nGandalf and attacked him under his madness. The two engage in battle\nuntil the wizard managed to to restrain him and used his power to bring\nback his senses.\n\nAfter Gandalf healed the dwarf from his madness that infected him, he\nwas so surprised and relieved that the dwarf was revealed to be Thráin,\nson of Thrór. Thráin began to remember what had happened to him and\nrealized that he was in Dol Guldur for a long time. Before leaving the\nold fortress, Thráin wanted to know if the map and key (that he gave to\nGandalf) were kept safe, but when the wizard told him that he gave the\nitems to Thorin who was embarked on the Quest of Erebor, Thráin was\nshocked by this and told Gandalf that his son, nor anyone, must never\nenter the mountain due to the sickness that lied upon the treasure.\nGandalf also discovers that the last of the Seven Dwarf Rings is\nmissing, and Thrain remembers how he lost it to Azog when he brutally\ncut off his ring finger.\n\nDuel in the Fortress\n\nAt around nightfall, Thráin helped Gandalf navigate through the fortress\nand continued to explain to him that Smaug and The One were in league\nwith each other until Azog himself launched a surprise attack and was\nable to stun Gandalf and scatter his staff and sword. Gandalf however\nwas able to reclaim his staff and easily repelled Azog with a\ntelekinetic force, enraging the pale orc. Gandalf keeps Azog and his\norcs at bay with his staff and demands to know where Sauron is, to which\nAzog replies “he is everywhere”. Gravely outnumbered, Gandalf used a\nflash spell for him and Thráin to flee from the orcs; he either\nteleported or simply ran away afterwards. Gandalf and Thráin make their\nescape, but are soon pursued by a group of Warg-riders. Gandalf uses his\nstaff to strike a wall; the resulting blast crumbles an entire tower\nthat crashes down on the Warg Riders and breaks the bridge. As they soon\nreached the entrance, Gandalf and Thráin found a cloud of darkness\nbarring their way out. It was the Necromancer, who warned “there is no\nlight which can defeat the darkness”. Seeing no way out, Thráin told\nGandalf to tell Thorin that he loved him, to which Gandalf replied he\ncould tell Thorin himself once they got out of there. Despite Gandalf's\nattempts to protect him, Thráin was sucked into the black mist and\nconsumed by the Necromancer.  After Thráin's death, Gandalf and the Necromancer engage\nin a battle of light and dark as the Necromancer launches a barrage of\nshadow energy at Gandalf, who repels it with a force field of light\npowered by his staff which makes his crystal grow with great light in a\nsmall radius. The Necromancer repeatedly launches himself at Gandalf's\nmassive spherical light shield, while Gandalf struggles to maintain it.\nSauron forces the shield to dissipate, but Gandalf conjures it again to\nhold off the dark energy. When Gandalf manages to push the energy\nfurther away from him, it stacks up and breaks through the shield a\nsecond time. Exhausted, Gandalf holds up his staff as a physical shield\nagainst his foe. The Necromancer then approaches him in a flaming\nspectral form, and the flames disintegrate Gandalf's staff. The smoke\nand flames telekinetically pin him against a wall, most of which\ncollapses from the surging energy. At this point the Necromancer can be\nseen as a figure with a horned helmet, in an aura of fire resembling a\ngreat eye. Gandalf's worst suspicions are confirmed as the Necromancer\nreveals himself to indeed be Sauron. Gandalf is later imprisoned in a\ncage and watches in horror as Azog's army of Guldur Orcs march towards\nthe Lonely Mountain.\n\n\nAppearances\n\n-   _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_ (First appearances)"

    "page_id": "36398",
    "text": "SIEGE OF DALE is a battle which took place at the ruins of Dale in TA\n2941.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBeginning of the battle outside Erebor and Dale\n\nBefore the Orc army arrived, there was an initial skirmish between\nThranduil's army and Dain's forces. After exchanging insults with\nThranduil, Gandalf, and Bard, Dáin ordered his ram-riders to charge the\nElves. Thranduil ordered his archers to fire a volley of arrows at the\nDwarves mounted on goats. But the Dwarves countered with spinning\nballista shots that shredded the hail of arrows and crashed into the\nElven ranks. However, once the Dwarves got close enough to Thranduil's\narmy, many of them were shot down or speared by the Elves. Some Elves\nwere knocked down by the goats, but others held firm against the Dwarves\ndespite their casualties. The Elven ranks simply reformed and funneled\nthe Dwarves in. Dáin and his infantry soon clashed into the ranks of the\nelves, resulting in the massacre of dozens of elves and dwarves. Before\nboth sides suffer heavier casualties, they are interrupted by the\nwere-worms bursting out of the ground and leaving behind five gaping\nholes in the ground.\n\nUpon the arrival of Azog's massive orc forces, Dáin Ironfoot rallies his\ntroops and leads his surviving forces of Dwarven warriors (consisting of\nmore than 40 Dwarven goat-riders, 5 war chariots carrying more than 20\nwarriors, and 800 Dwarven infantry) to battle against the Orc armies.\nThe dwarves set up a shieldwall and stand their ground as the orcs\ncharge toward them in a massive wave. Before the orcs collide with the\ndwarves, Thranduil dispatches several hundred of his elf-warriors to\nlaunch a surprise frontal attack. The distraction is enough for the\ndwarves to break their shieldwall and charge into the ranks of the orcs\nwith lowered spears. Dain on his armored war hog and Thranduil on his\ngiant stag fight in the front ranks, slaying dozens of orc warriors in\nthe process.\n\nSeeing the first wave of his troops being cut to pieces by the elves and\ndwarves, Azog signals his war beasts to attack. Dozens of armored\nmountain trolls and Ogres pour out of the tunnels and advance upon the\ndwarves and elves. Thranduil rallies his archers who fire a barrage of\narrows at the war beasts, killing three Guldur Olog-Hai trolls and\nhundreds of orcs in the process. Dáin and Thranduil then throw the rest\nof their troops into the fray and launch a fresh attack, inflicting\nheavy casualties on the forces of Azog the Defiler.\n\nAzog notices two of the dwarven war chariots slaughtering dozens of his\nwarriors and orders his war beasts to destroy the chariots. A group of\nten ogres charge the war chariots and managed to destroy them in the\nprocess, crushing the goats pulling the chariots and striking down the\ndwarves with their clubs.\n\nBreaching the Walls of Dale\n\nKnowing that the dwarves, men, and elves could not fight on two\nbattlefronts, Azog seizes the opportunity and orders a full-scale attack\non the city of Dale. A force consisting of nearly 10,000 Guldur Orcs,\nfour armored trolls, and fifteen Ogres began their advance towards the\nwalls of Dale, while seven massive trolls, each of them carrying a\ncatapult on their backs manned by a crew of seven Goblin Mercenaries\nclimb out of the tunnels and set up their positions on a hilltop facing\nDale.\n\nAs Bard and his men, along with Gandalf and Bilbo fall back to the city,\nthe catapults were fired and inflicted heavy damage on the walls of the\ncity. A portion of the wall was breached and collapsed by a troll-ram,\nand hundreds of orcs poured into the city, killing dozens of the\nunexpected Laketown villagers inside.\n\nRescue of Bain, Sigrid, and Tilda\n\nAs the Guldur orcs pour into Dale and terrorize the villagers, Bard's\ndaughters Sigrid and Tilda become separated from their brother Bain and\nare closely pursued by two orcs. Bain soon finds them and rescues his\nsisters by killing the two orcs with a sword he took out of the city\narmory. The three children soon catch up with their father, who has led\nhis men in a full-front charge against the orcs and goblins.\n\nBard soon finds his children waiting for him at the abandoned\nmarketplace, but soon discovers a large ogre advancing upon them with\nhis club raised above his head. Mounting on an abandoned cart and riding\ndown the sloping road, Bard rides the cart over the heads of his\ndaughters and son, jumps off the cart, and drives his sword through the\nogre's chest, killing him instantly.\n\nRetreat to the Citadel\n\nAfter rescuing his children from the ogre, Bard tells them to gather the\nwomen and children and lead them to the safety of the citadel. At first,\nBain, Sigrid, and Tilda refuse to do so and want to stay with their\nfather, but Bard, with a little help from Alfrid Lickspittle, urges them\nto do what they are told. The children do not hesitate to help the\nsurviving villagers gather together and make their way through the\ndeserted buildings of the city until they arrive at the citadel.\n\nWhile Alfrid, Bain, Sigrid, Tilda, and the Laketown villagers make their\nway to the citadel, Bard gathers his men together and launches a fresh\nattack against the Guldur Orcs and armored trolls. Bowmen fire arrows at\nthe orcs and goblins, killing dozens of them in the process. Laketown\nguards and militia keep back the orcs with spears and swords, with Bard\nfighting at their head. Gandalf strikes down a few orcs with his staff\nand uses his sword Glamdring to cut down several others, while Bilbo\nslashes at the legs of a few orcs with his sword Sting.\n\nArrival of Thranduil and the Wood Elves into Dale\n\nAs more orcs and goblins, along with a small group of armored trolls,\npour through several breaches into the walls of Dale, Thranduil gathers\na company of his warriors and archers and leads a charge towards the\nmain gate. Thranduil rides ahead of his forces on his giant stag,\ntrampling down and slaying dozens of Guldur Orcs that have occupied the\nbridge leading to the gate. The stag even catches several orcs in his\nmassive antlers, to which the king of the wood elves dispatches them\nquickly by beheading them with his sword.\n\nJust as Thranduil rides through the open gates of the city, goblin\narchers shoot down his stag, forcing the Elven king to leap down from\nhis fallen mount and find himself surrounded by dozens of Guldur Orcs.\nWielding his two curved Elven swords, Thranduil furiously attacks the\norcs, slaying a large number of them before the rest of his warriors\njoin him in the fray. The wood elves fight furiously to protect their\nking, but dozens of them are slain by the pikes and scimitars of the\norcs in the process.\n\nThe Dwarves and Men are driven back\n\nBard and his men stand their ground and try to kill as many orcs as\npossible, but they are heavily outnumbered and fall one by one beneath\nthe swords and pikes of the orcs. With the villagers safely inside the\ncitadel and dozens of his men being slain by the enemy, Bard orders his\nsurviving troops to pull back to the citadel. The Guldur Orcs then\npursue the men, slaying several more as they retreat. Bilbo, Gandalf,\nThranduil, and the Silvan Elves continue to fight on, killing many of\nthe enemy as they become surrounded on all sides.\n\nOutside the city of Dale and the Lonely Mountain, the situation goes\nfrom bad to worse for Dain and his warriors. Many of the wood elves who\nhad joined them at the beginning of the battle are slain by the ferocity\nof the orcs, Ogres, and trolls, while a few hundred of the survivors\npull back to Dale to join up with their king. The orcs and trolls begin\nto overpower Dáin's own troops, crushing and slaying dozens of the\nDwarves in the process. Three orcs kill Dáin's armored hog with their\npikes and the dismounted Dwarf-lord furiously attacks them, wielding his\nwar hammer and crushing several of them. He calls out to his troops and\nwonders where his cousin Thorin was, stating that they needed him.\n\nRealizing that they would soon be overrun by the vehemence and\noverwhelming numbers of the enemy, Dáin calls for a retreat to the\nbarred gateway of Erebor. Dáin and more than 300 surviving Dwarves\nmanage to break through the ranks of the orcs and set up a defensive\nposition by the main gateway. The remaining enemy forces of Azog,\nconsisting of more than 10,000 Guldur Orcs, a dozen Trolls, a few Ogres,\nand several dozen Goblin Mercenaries also regroup and begin to advance\nupon the remaining Dwarves.\n\nThorin and Bard rally the Dwarves and Men\n\nJust as the orc forces of Azog begin to gain control of the fields\noutside Erebor and the city of Dale, inside the Lonely Mountain Thorin\nbroods for a while on his dragon-sickness. He then suffers an\nhallucination and regains his sanity, realizing the wrongs that he had\ndone and that he must now join forces with Dáin, Bard, and Thranduil\noutside Erebor. He confesses to his companions of the wrongs he had done\nbefore he asks them to follow him into battle for the final time.\n\nAs Dáin and his remaining warriors prepare to make their final stand at\nthe barred gateway of the Lonely Mountain, Azog orders his remaining\nGuldur forces to attack the Dwarves. Behind the ranks of Guldur Orcs, a\nlarge troll bearing a catapult manned by a crew of seven Goblin\nMercenaries assembles itself facing the walls of Erebor. Six Guldur\nOlog-Hai Trolls armed with spiked wooden clubs lead the advance, with\nthe Guldur Orcs following behind them. Before the Dol Guldur army\nreaches the Dwarves, Bombur sounds the great war horn of Erebor which\ncauses the advancing enemy forces to halt in surprise and confusion.\nInside the walls of Dale, Bilbo, Gandalf, Thranduil, Bard, and the elves\nand men also hear the horn being sounded and know that Thorin has joined\nthe fight. Thorin and his twelve companions break open the front gate\nwith a massive golden bell and charge out into the battlefield, donned\nin their armor and wielding axes, hammers, swords, and round shields.\nDáin and his warriors then rally to Thorin and join him in the charge,\nletting loose their war cry and advancing upon Azog's forces.\n\nThree Olog-Hai Trolls are killed from a volley of spears hurled by the\nDwarves before they reach their ranks, and the remaining three Olog-Hai\nare cut down by the axes and swords of the Dwarven warriors. Thorin,\nDáin, and their companions furiously collide against the ranks of the\norcs, slaying hundreds of them in the process. Thorin, Fili, and Kili\ncut down several orcs with their short swords and shields, Dwalin, Nori,\nBofur, and Dáin II Ironfoot strike down dozens of orcs with their war\nhammers, and Bombur wielding a flail smashes the skulls of a few orcs.\nThe catapult-bearing troll is also killed, the Goblin Mercenaries are\nslaughtered, and the catapult is quickly destroyed.\n\nUpon learning that Thorin has rallied the Dwarves and is driving back\nthe orcs outside Dale and Erebor, Bard seizes his chance and rallies his\nremaining soldiers to fight against the Orcs pouring the streets of\nDale. With renewed courage and valor, the Men of Dale and Esgaroth\ncharge the orcs in a desperate attempt to kill as many as possible.\nBilbo and Gandalf also join the men in their fight, killing several orcs\nand Goblin Mercenaries in the process.\n\nThe women of Esgaroth join the battle\n\nAs Bard and his men launch their counterattack against the Orcs, Hilda\nBianca grabs a spear and tells the women and children that they should\nstand with the men in battle. As Bain and many of the women arm\nthemselves with spears, knives, axes, and swords, Hilda and a few other\nwomen discover that Alfird has disguised himself as a woman to hide from\nthe enemy. Hilda calls him a coward and a weasel before leading the\narmed citizens out of the main hall to face the enemy forces approaching\nthe citadel. A jar tumbles off a rotting shelf and shatters on the\nstones, to which Alfrid discovers that it is filled with gold and silver\ncoins from the Lonely Mountain.\n\nOutside the citadel, a company of a hundred Guldur orcs pour out of the\nstreets of the city and advance upon the citadel with raised shields and\ndrawn scimitars. Hilda, Bain, and the women of Esgaroth charge the Orcs\nwith their weapons drawn and collide into their ranks. The Orcs fought\nviciously, but soon found themselves being cut down by the dozens by the\nferocity of the villagers. A large orc wielding an iron scimitar is\ngored in the stomach by Hilda's spear, a few others are cut down by\nBain's own sword, and the women slay a large number of others before the\nfew remaining orcs retreat in utter panic.\n\nBofur vs. the Amputated War Troll\n\nOutside Dale and Erebor, Thorin has successfully rallied the Dwarves and\ninflicted heavy casualties upon the orcs and trolls, but Thorin, his\ncousin Dáin, and their warriors are still heavily outnumbered. During\nthe battle, Bofur discovers a large amputated war troll wreaking havoc\namong the ranks of Dáin's warriors, crushing dozens of dwarves with its\nflail arms and spiked club-feet. With the help of Nori and Gloin, Bofur\nmanages to climb onto the troll's back, kills the orc driving the troll\nwith an axe, and takes control of the troll. He reins in the troll and\ndirects it into the ranks of the Guldur Orcs, crushing dozens of orcs in\nthe process.\n\nThe Dwarf-Chariot vs. Trolls, Ogres, and Wargs\n\nAfter rescuing his cousin from a few Guldur Orcs, Dáin and Thorin\nreunite with each other on the battlefield. Dáin points out that there\nare too many orcs for the dwarves to handle and tells Thorin that he\nhopes he has a plan. Thorin, upon mounting one of the few remaining\narmored goats, tells Dáin that he plans to ride to Ravenhill and kill\nAzog once and for all. Dáin then asks Thorin on how he plans to fight\nsingle-handed to Azog's command post on Ravenhill, but before Thorin can\nrespond, a dwarf-chariot drawn by a team of six rams appears. Balin\ndrives the team, while Dwalin takes control of the arrow-launcher and\nFili and Kili position themselves on either side of the chariot. As\nThorin and his companions ride towards Ravenhill, Dáin states calmly,\n“May Durin save you all.”\n\nThorin and his companions immediately charge into the front ranks of a\nlarge battalion of Guldur Orcs, slaughtering dozens of them in the\nprocess. Azog notices this and signals for his war beasts to attack. Six\naggressive ogres lumber towards the dwarf-chariot, but the goats and\nchariot spring off the top of a rock that is towering above the ogres,\nand the scythe-blades on the chariot's wheels severs the ogres' heads,\nkilling them all instantly. At the same time, a massive Troll armed with\nsickle blades attached to his arms charges straight at the dwarves, but\nBalin turns the goats sharply to the right and drives the chariot onto a\nfrozen river. The troll springs into the river, breaking the ice beneath\nhis weight, and crawls across the ice after the chariot. Kili tries\nshooting at the troll with his bow, including an arrow that pierces the\ntroll's right claw, but the troll slowly gains on the dwarves. Bofur\nimmediately comes to the rescue by having the amputated troll swing its\nflail arms into the troll's neck and skull, but the dying troll drags\nthe amputated troll into the river with him. Bofur barely manages to\nescape by falling off the troll's back and landing on the ice for\nsafety.\n\nBalin, Dwalin, Fili, and Kili immediately discover a second armored\ntroll standing in the middle of the frozen river, holding over its head\na wooden bridge with dozens of Goblin Mercenary archers and orc archers\nmounted on it and blocking the chariot. Fili and Kili with their bows\nand Dwalin with the arrow launcher immediately fire at the troll,\npiercing the troll's jaw and throat with several bolts and killing the\nbrute instantly. The goblins and orcs are killed as well, and the\nchariot safely passes over the dead troll's body.\n\nSuddenly, a pack of wargs, with a dozen or so warg-riders appear on\neither side of the chariot and attack the goats pulling the chariot and\nthe dwarves mounted on it. Despite Dwalin's, Fili's, and Kili's attempts\nto protect the goats and they manage to slay several wargs and orcs, the\nwargs managed to pull down and kill three of the goats during the chase.\nWith only three remaining goats pulling the heavy chariot and the wargs\nclosing in behind them, the dwarves know that they will never make it to\nRavenhill. Balin immediately tells his brother to cut the traces and\nride the remaining goats to Ravenhill, volunteering to stay behind and\nhold back the wargs as long as he could. Dwalin, Fili, and Kili mount on\nthe three goats, cut them free of the chariot, and ride them onward to\nRavenhill, while Balin activates the arrow launcher and kills all of the\nremaining wargs and warg-riders. Dwalin, Fili, and Kili soon catch up to\nThorin, who leads them up the slopes of Ravenhill and slay a small force\nof Guldur orcs stationed at the foot of the hill.\n\nDeath of Alfrid Lickspittle\n\nBack in the city of Dale, Alfrid gathers up a huge amount of coins into\nhis corset and attempts to escape from the battle, but he is confronted\nby a massive ogre who raises its club to kill him. Alfrid is quickly\nsaved by Bard, who kills the ogre by firing an arrow into its chest.\nBard angrily orders Alfrid to get up, but Alfrid argues that he makes\nhis own decisions. Though he calls him a coward, Bard reluctantly lets\nAlfrid go.\n\nShortly after this, Alfrid ran into trouble yet again. While Gandalf was\nattempting to ward off a troll with his new staff, Alfrid had foolishly\nhidden himself inside the net of a trebuchet. Gandalf's staff was\nmalfunctioning however, and as the troll advanced Alfrid panicked and\nsent a few coins tumbling from his corset. One coin landed on the\ntrigger, and the trebuchet launched the screaming Alfrid into the trolls\nmouth, where he was suffocated to death. In turn the troll choked on him\nand died too as Gandalf watched in surprise.\n\n\nStalemate\n\nThe counterattack by Bard and the townspeople of Esgaroth has managed to\nstabilize the situation, but Legolas and Tauriel arrive with news that\nBolg is approacing from the north with an army of Gundabad Orcs. Gandalf\ntries to persuade Thranduil to dispatch his remaining forces to\nRavenhill to warn Thorin of the unexpected attack, but Thranduil refuses\nto spill any more blood of his people and decides to depart for\nMirkwood. Thranduil and his troops reach the main gateway, but are\nhalted by Tauriel and Legolas. After a short argument and learning that\nhis son prefers to die defending the sons of Durin than saving his own\nlife, the Elven-king makes up his mind and follows Legolas and Tauriel\nto Ravenhill.\n\n\nEnding and aftermath\n\nThe arrival of the Eagles and the death of Azog ended the siege. The\nsurviving Orcs retreated to the tunnels, allowing the exhausted Elves\nand Men to claim a pyrrhic victory. An agreement was reached in the\naftermath with Bard becoming King of Dale at the end of the battle and\nhis people getting paid by Dain Ironfoot the riches that Thorin had\npromised them.\n\n\nAppearances\n\n-   _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_\n\n\nSee Also\n\n-   Battle of Five Armies\n-   Battle of Dale"

    "page_id": "44075",
    "text": "The SÁRA BASK was a vast sunburned forest located in Sirayn, that\nstretched from the junction of the Sîresha and Sîrsis rivers to the\ncoast of the Bay of Ormal.\n\nThe wood is situated on the hilly flanks of the Tûr Betark and depends\nsolely on runoff from the mountains. Hardy species of trees well adapted\nto the intense sunlight of the region, such as cork, olive, and fig, as\nwell as the date palm, flourish on the lower slopes of the foothills.\nEqually tough scrub bushes create irnpassible thickets between their\ntrunks. Mangrove thrives in depressions along the Sîresha where flood\nwaters are trapped and stagnate for several months, while magnolia and\nwillow occupy the better drained riverbanks and streambanks within the\nSára Bask. Coconut palms, marauha palms, and sakpalms grow in profusion\nalong the coast of the Mard Isauba. Plametto marks the western fringe of\nthe wood where the durable soils of Isra hold cultivated fields along\nthe Sîrsis. Needle- and broad-leaved decidous trees fill the higher\nelevations of the Sára Bask, giving way to the Sîranean and Tasab\nspruces on the crests of the foothills.\n\n\nFlora and fauna\n\nNumerous streams and small rivers, fed by rainfall on the peaks of the\nTûr Betark, water the foothills covered by the Sára Bask. Inured to\nintense sunlight moderated by little cloud cover and scant rainfall, but\nabundant ground water, the species that comprise the wood are a hardy\nand select group. Figs, olives, cork, date palms, and _torbachenna_\ntrees (bearing fruit similar to an olive, but larger, with yellow\ncoloring) thrive on the lower slopes. A large variety of scrub bushes\ncreate tangled thickets between their trunks. The eastern fringes of the\nforest, along the coast, are comprised of a variety of palms: coconut,\n_marauba_ (bearing a fruit similar to a cross between a coconut and a\npineapple), and _sak_ (fiber from the cocoons of the sakworms that eat\nits leaves can be spun into a cloth with the comfort of silk and the\ndurability of linen). The westem edge of the wood, along the Sîrsis and\nthe fields of Isra, is dominated by the palmetto. Depressions in the\nland adjacent to the Sîresha, where flood waters sometimes remain for\nmonths, harbor concentrations of mangrove, while the drier stream banks\npossess groves of magnolia and willow. Broad- and needle-leaved\ndeciduous trees such as the _muna_ and the _baranaud_ predominate at\nhigher elevations. Frequent clearings on these steeper inclines shelter\n_farain_ grass and _ketatas_ stalks. The hilltops sport stands of the\nSiranean and Tasab spruces. _Tauvezin_ moss thrives amidst their roots.\n\nThe fig, olive, cork, date plams and _torhachenna_ trees possess obvious\nvalue to merchants and traders, but the plants thriving on the forest\nfloor attract equal attention. Their pollens and spores are collected by\nskilled herbalists from _Isra_ and _Chennacatt_ for use as medicines,\ncombat enhancers, and antidotes to poisons. The Yatali-gan, dwellers\nwithin the Sára Bask, harvest an even greater portion of the wood’s\nflora to concoct healing infusions and salves. For every beneficial\nherb, there are dozens of dangerous varieties. Without the knowledge of\na naturalist, it is not advised to sample at random.\n\nA large proportion of the spices commonly utilized in the cuisines of\nSirayn are native to the forest. Gathering these condiments can be very\nhazardous. Wild animals and the Yatali-gan add to the dangers posed by\npoisonous spores and roagh terrain. Most successful spice traders\ncultivate hybrids adapted to slightly dryer soils in small plots near\ntheir homes in Isra. The favorites include musky _sinabaud_, sweet\n_nantarb_, zesty _charbis_, and subtle _rosain_.\n\n-   Eddij - This beny is highly prized in Sirayn. If its juices are\n    placed in the eyes of a deceased person within 30 days of their\n    death, the individual will be restored to life. Very rare, it grows\n    only along small streams in the deepest parts of the Sára Bask. Only\n    the fabulously wealthy can afford this herb.\n-   Copal - Copal is a brittle, aromatic, yellow-red resin collected\n    from _bîritrees_ in the Sára Bask. The resin is highly valued to\n    woodworkers who use it to make high quality vamishes.\n-   Kasia - Kasia causes slight euphoria when used in large quantities.\n    The spice is made from the ground nut of the _kasia_ tree and is\n    used in many of the dishes throughout Sirayn. It is also a favored\n    trade item.\n-   Rud Tekma - Mages throughout Sirayn seek the fruit of the tekma. The\n    fruit of this plant enhances a magician’s abilities when using\n    spells. The effects last one hour, affecting movement and melee\n    negatively, but magic positively. The fruit is relatively addictive.\n\nThe predominance of streams in the Sára Bask permits a larger animal\npopulation to thrive in the region. Numerous insects buzz from flower to\nflower when the fig, olive, and _torbachenna_ trees are in bloom. Birds,\nreptiles, and rodents eat the insects and in tum are preyed upon by\nlarger animals. Some of the wasps common to the lower slopes of the wood\npossess a venom so powerful that victims of their sting die of\nanaphylactic shock within minutes. Only the Yatali-gan have leamed how\nto create salves that consistently drive off these humming menaces. Some\nof the larger insects and grubs serve as delicacies in the feasts of the\nresourceful forest-dwellers.\n\nBaboons, small deer, squirrels, cougars, and chipmunks, number among the\nlarger species of the wood . Small birds of goldspeckled brown plumage\noccupy nests in the tree boughs or hide among the shadows of the\nthickets on the forest floor. Many are hunted by the Yatali-gan for\nfood. The _gacalac_ alone is sought for the metallic appearance of its\ngold, silver, and copper-toned plumage. A few are taken as pets. The\nbuzz of insects, broken by infrequent birdcalls, dominates the Sára Bask\nat all times. It is rumored that when the foothills are quiet even the\nspirits of the wood tremble.\n\n-   A-lori-ma-lau - The a-lori-ma-lau, also known as Large Cat, Hill Cat\n    or Kirsis, is the most feared predator of the Sára Bask. The male\n    and female of the species hunt in pairs and will stalk humans. Their\n    coat is a golden brown. Yatali-gan believe that they are the claws\n    of the spirits of the woods.\n-   Gacalac - The gacalac is an exotic bird with very bright plumage.\n    The plumage gleams like gold and silver and is used for decorations\n    and adomment. Tamed gacalac are kept for show and for their\n    beautiful voices.\n-   Kastaba - The kastaba is a small poisonous bronze toad. Just holding\n    the toad in one’s hands will cause extreme pain and precipitate a\n    weakening of the individual ’s constitution. If he or she wipes his\n    or her eyes with an infected digit, the individual may become blind.\n    The secretions of the kasataba may be used to make a paste that will\n    kill if placed on a sword edge or an arrow point. If the victim does\n    not die from the poison, he or she will faII into a coma and be\n    permanently blind upon awakening.\n-   Ru-lani-lapu - The ru-lani-lapu, also known as Red Baboon, Tangat or\n    Safataub, is a holy animal to the Yatali-gan of the Sára Bask.\n    Moderately intelligent, they make very nice pets. Some thieves in\n    Sirayn have trained these apes to pilfer small objects. The baboons\n    normally weigh less than 20 pounds and eat fruits and vegetables."

    "title": "Great Tales",
    "page_id": "45987",
    "text": "The GREAT TALES made up the most important tales of the First Age.\n\nAll of them are covered within _The History of Middle-earth_, but\nrecently, lone publications of some of them have been made, in the same\nmanner as _The Children of Húrin_ in 2007.\n\n\nPublications and chapters\n\n-   _The Children of Húrin_ (2007)\n-   _Beren and Lúthien_ (2017)\n-   _The Fall of Gondolin_ (2018)\n-   _The Tale of Eärendel_ (a chapter is included with _The Fall of\n    Gondolin_ publication, and _The Book of Lost Tales Part Two_.)\n\n\nBackground\n\n_The Fall of Gondolin_, “...together with _Beren and Lúthien_ and _The\nChildren of Húrin_, he regarded it as one of the three ‘Great Tales’ of\nthe Elder Days.”\n\nTolkien also referred to the 'four great tales' as the _Great Saga_ or\n_The Lays of the Children of Atani_.\n\nHe originally envisioned writing several stories from the entire _Quenta\nSilmarillion_ as full, standalone stories.\n\n    “I would draw some of the great tales in fullness, and leave many\n    only placed in the scheme, and sketched.”\n\nChristopher Tolkien states in the forward to _The Children of Húrin_:\n\n    It is seen from this reminiscence that from far back it was a part\n    of his conception of what came to be called _The Silmarillion_ that\n    some of the ‘Tales’ should be told in much fuller form; and indeed\n    in that same letter of 1951 he referred expressly to the three\n    stories which I have mentioned above as being much the longest in\n    _The Book of Lost Tales_. Here he called the tale of _Beren and\n    Lúthien_ ‘the chief of the stories of _The Silmarillion_’, and of it\n    he said: ‘the story is (I think a beautiful and powerful)\n    heroic-fairy-romance, receivable in itself with only a very general\n    vague knowledge of the background. But it is also a fundamental link\n    in the cycle, deprived of its full significance out of its place\n    therein.’ ‘There are other stories almost equally full in\n    treatment,’ he went on, ‘and equally independent, and yet linked to\n    the general history’: these are _The Children of Húrin_ and _The\n    Fall of Gondolin_.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n    It thus seems unquestionable, from my father’s own words, that if he\n    could achieve final and finished narratives on the scale he desired,\n    he saw the three ‘Great Tales’ of the Elder Days (_Beren and\n    Lúthien_, the _Children of Húrin_, and the _Fall of Gondolin_) as\n    works sufficiently complete in themselves as not to demand knowledge\n    of the great body of legend known as _The Silmarillion_.\n\nChristopher also stated in the _The War of the Jewels_:\n\n    The completion of the _Quenta Silmarillion_ remained an aim; but the\n    'great tales', vastly developed from their original forms, from\n    which its later chapters should be derived were never achieved.\n\n\nOther Great Tales\n\nTolkien has used the term 'great tale' to refer to other works in his\nlegendarium as well.\n\nFor example in _Letters 131_ (quote mentioned above) which Tolkien\nrefers to all of the stories in the _Quenta Silmarillion_ as 'great\ntales', he also discusses _Lord of the Rings_ as being the last 'great\nTale':\n\n    But as the earliest Tales are seen through Elvish eyes, as it were,\n    this last great Tale, coming down from myth and legend to the earth,\n    is seen mainly though the eyes of Hobbits: it thus becomes in fact\n    anthropocentric.\n\nSam makes reference to this in _The Return of the King_ when he states\n(when comparing their own story to Beren and Lúthien's tale):\n\n    “Why, to think of it, we’re in the same tale still! It’s going on.\n    Don’t the great tales never end?”\n\nOne of the earliest references to the term 'great tale' is included in\nthe “The Cottage of Lost Play” in _The Book of Lost Tales_:\n\n    Now it happened on a certain time that a traveller from far\n    countries, a man of great curiosity, was by desire of strange lands\n    and the ways and dwellings of unaccustomed folk brought in a ship as\n    far west even as the Lonely Island, Tol Eressëa in the fairy speech,\n    but which the Gnomes1 call Dor Faidwen, the Land of Release, and a\n    great tale hangs thereto.\n\nThe _Book of Lost Tales_ makes several other references to 'great tales'\nas well\n\n    \n\nThe chapter _The Hiding of Valinor_ is also called a 'great tale':\n\n    And thus ended Vairë, and the great tale fell silent in the room.\n\nIn _The Tale of Tinúviel_ Beren uses flattery towards Melko (Morgoth) by\nstating:\n\n    Many a great tale has my father made to me aforetime of thy\n    splendour and glory, wherefore, albeit I am no renegade thrall, I do\n    desire nothing so much as to serve thee in what small manner I\n    may...\n\nOne of the earliest references to the Fall of Gondolin being a 'great\ntale':\n\n    Yet now those exiles of Gondolin dwelt at the mouth of Sirion by the\n    waves of the Great Sea. There they take the name of Lothlim, the\n    people of the flower, for Gondothlim is a name too sore to their\n    hearts; and fair among the Lothlim Eärendel grows in the house of\n    his father, and the great tale of Tuor is come to its waning.\n\nFinally, the references to the unwritten _Tale of Eärendel_ in the\nchapter _The Fall of Gondolin_ which includes _Tuor and the Exiles of\nGondolin (which bringeth in the great tale of Eärendel)_:\n\n    And thus did all the fates of the fairies weave then to one strand,\n    and that strand is the great tale of Eärendel; and to that tale’s\n    true beginning are we now come.\n\n\nReferences"
