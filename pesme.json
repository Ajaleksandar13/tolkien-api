    "text": "BILBO'S LAST SONG is a poem by J. R. R. Tolkien.\n\n\nLyrics\n\n Day is ended, dim my eyes, but journey long before me lies. Farewell,\nfriends! I hear the call. The ship's beside the stony wall. Foam is\nwhite and waves are grey; beyond the sunset leads my way. Foam is salt,\nthe wind is free; I hear the rising of the Sea.\n\nFarewell, friends! The sails are set, the wind is east, the moorings\nfret. Shadows long before me lie, beneath the ever-bending sky, but\nislands lie behind the Sun that I shall raise ere all is done; lands\nthere are to west of West, where night is quiet and sleep is rest.\n\nGuided by the Lonely Star, beyond the utmost harbour-bar I'll find the\nhavens fair and free, and beaches of the Starlit Sea. Ship, my ship! I\nseek the West, and fields and mountains ever blest. Farewell to\nMiddle-earth at last. I see the Star above your mast!\n\n\nHistory\n\nBilbo's Last Song was given by Tolkien as a gift to his secretary Joy\nHill in 1966. After Tolkien's death in 1973, Hill showed the poem to\nDonald Swann, who liked the poem so much that he set it to music and\nincluded it in the second edition of The Road Goes Ever On in 1978. The\npoem was also illustrated by Pauline Baynes, and published as a poster\nin 1974. In 1990, the text was finally published in book form,\nre-illustrated by Baynes. Its original publisher was Houghton\nMifflin, then Allen & Unwin in 1992, and then by Dragonfly Books in\n1992. and a few others like Riverwood Publishing Inc.\n\nBilbo Baggins sings the poem at the harbours of the Grey Havens, as\nhe is about to set sail on the sea following the Straight Road to the\nUndying Lands. Although it was never written in _The Grey Havens_, the\nThe Lord of the Rings's last chapter, this places the reading of this\npoem by Bilbo at this point in the story."

    "text": "The SONG OF BEREN AND LÚTHIEN was sung by Aragorn at the camp at\nWeathertop to distract Frodo Baggins, Meriadoc Brandybuck, Peregrin\nTook, and Sam Gamgee from their fears. Aragorn tells the hobbits that\nthe song is in the _ann-thennath_ mode in the Elvish tongue and that the\nWestron version is nowhere near as lovely. He also says that no one,\nexcept Elrond, remembers the end of the tale correctly anymore.\n\n\nThe Song\n\n The leaves were long, the grass was green, The hemlock-umbels tall and\nfair, And in the glade a light was seen Of stars in shadow shimmering.\nTinúviel was dancing there To music of a pipe unseen, And light of stars\nwas in her hair, And in her raiment glimmering.\n\nThere Beren came from mountains cold, And lost he wandered under leaves,\nAnd where the Elven-river rolled He walked alone and sorrowing. He\npeered between the hemlock-leaves And saw in wonder flowers of gold Upon\nher mantle and her sleeves, And her hair like shadow following.\n\nEnchantment healed his weary feet That over hills were doomed to roam;\nAnd forth he hastened, strong and fleet, And grasped at moonbeams\nglistening. Through woven woods in Elvenhome She lightly fled on dancing\nfeet, And left him lonely still to roam In the silent forest listening.\n\nHe heard there oft the flying sound Of feet as light as linden-leaves,\nOr music welling underground, In hidden hollows quavering. Now withered\nlay the hemlock-sheaves, And one by one with sighing sound Whispering\nfell the beechen leaves In the wintry woodland wavering.\n\nHe sought her ever, wandering far Where leaves of years were thickly\nstrewn, By light of moon and ray of star In frosty heavens shivering.\nHer mantle glinted in the moon, As on a hilltop high and far She danced,\nand at her feet was strewn A mist of silver quivering.\n\nWhen winter passed, she came again, And her song released the sudden\nspring, Like rising lark, and falling rain, And melting water bubbling.\nHe saw the elven-flowers spring About her feet, and healed again He\nlonged by her to dance and sing Upon the grass untroubling.\n\nAgain she fled, but swift he came. Tinúviel! Tinúviel! He called her by\nher elvish name, And there she halted listening. One moment stood she,\nand a spell His voice laid on her: Beren came, And doom fell on Tinúviel\nThat in his arms lay glistening.\n\nAs Beren looked into her eyes Within the shadows of her hair, The\ntrembling starlight of the skies He saw there mirrored shimmering.\nTinúviel the elven-fair, Immortal maiden elven-wise, About him cast her\nshadowy hair And arms like silver glimmering.\n\nLong was the way that fate them bore, O'er stony mountains cold and\ngrey, Through halls of iron and darkling door, And woods of nightshade\nmorrowless. The Sundering Seas between them lay, And yet at last they\nmet once more, And long ago they passed away In the forest singing\nsorrowless.\n"

    "title": "Song of Eärendil",
    "page_id": "6248",
    "text": "SONG OF EÄRENDIL is a song written primarily by Bilbo Baggins, though\nhis friend Aragorn helps with a few lines. He sings it in Rivendell's\nHall of Fire after the feast celebrating Frodo Baggins's recovery from\nhis Weathertop wound. Apparently, Bilbo had asked his listeners to guess\nwhich parts he wrote and which were Aragorn's work; the Elves gathered\naround request a second recital of the song in order to make their\nguess, as “It is not easy for us to tell the difference between two\nmortals,” much to Bilbo's dismay. He later tells Frodo that Aragorn\nmerely insisted on putting in a green stone and that the rest was his\nown work. Aragorn also commented that “if I (Bilbo) had the cheek to\nmake verses about Eärendil in the house of Elrond, it was my (Bilbo's)\naffair.”\n\n\nThe Song\n\n Eärendil was a mariner that tarried in Arvernien; he built a boat of\ntimber felled in Nimbrethil to journey in; her sails he wove of silver\nfair, of silver were her lanterns made, her prow was fashioned like a\nswan, and light upon her banners laid.\n\nIn panoply of ancient kings, in chainéd rings he armoured him; his\nshining shield was scored with runes to ward all wounds and harm from\nhim; his bow was made of dragon-horn, his arrows shorn of ebony, of\nsilver was his habergeon, his scabbard of chalcedony; his sword of steel\nwas valiant, of adamant his helmet tall, an eagle-plume upon his crest,\nupon his breast an emerald.\n\nBeneath the Moon and under star he wandered far from northern strands,\nbewildered on enchanted ways beyond the days of mortal lands. From\ngnashing of the Narrow Ice where shadow lies on frozen hills, from\nnether heats and burning waste he turned in haste, and roving still on\nstarless waters far astray at last he came to Night of Naught, and\npassed, and never sight he saw of shining shore nor light he sought. The\nwinds of wrath came drving him, and blindly in the foam he fled from\nwest to east and errandless, unheralded he homeward sped.\n\nThere flying Elwing came to him, and flame was in the darkness lit; more\nbright than light of diamond the fire upon her carcanet. The Silmaril\nshe bound on him and crowned him with the living light and dauntless\nthen with burning brow he turned his prow; and in the night from\nOtherworld beyond the Sea there strong and free a storm arose, a wind of\npower in Tarmenel; by paths that seldom mortal goes his boat it bore\nwith biting breath as might of death across the grey and long-forsaken\nseas distressed: from east to west he passed away.\n\nThrough Evernight he back was borne on black and roaring waves that ran\no'er leagues unlit and foundered shores that drowned before the Days\nbegan, until he heard on strands of pearl where ends the world the music\nlong, where ever-foaming billows roll the yellow gold and jewels wan.\n\nHe saw the Mountain silent rise where twilight lies upon the knees of\nValinor, and Eldamar beheld afar beyond the seas. A wanderer escaped\nfrom night to haven white he came at last, to Elvenhome the green and\nfair where keen the air, where pale as glass beneath the Hill of Ilmarin\na-glimmer in a valley sheer the lamplit towers of Tirion are mirrored on\nthe Shadowmere.\n\nHe tarried there from errantry, and melodies they taught to him, and\nsages old him marvels told, and harps of gold they brought to him. They\nclothed him then in elven-white, and seven lights before him sent, as\nthrough the Calacirian to hidden land forlorn he went. He came unto the\ntimeless halls where shining fall the countless year, and endless reigns\nthe Elder King in Ilmarin on Mountain sheer; and words unheard were\nspoken then of folk of Men and Elven-kin, beyond the world were visions\nshowed forbid to those that dwell therein.\n\nA ship then new they built for him of mithril and of elven-glass with\nshining prow; no shaven oar nor sail she bore on silver mas: the\nSilmaril as lantern light and banner bright with living flame to gleam\nthereon by Elbereth herself was set, who thither came and wings immortal\nmade for him, and laid on him undying doom, to sail the shoreless skies\nand come behind the Sun and light of Moon.\n\nFrom Evereven's lofty hills where softly silver fountains fall his wings\nhim bore, a wandering light, beyond the mighty Mountain Wall. From\nWorld's End then he turned away, and yearned again to find afar his home\nthrough shadow journeying, and burning as an island star on high above\nthe mists he came, a distant flame before the Sun, a wonder ere the\nwaking dawn where grey the Norland waters run.\n\nAnd over Middle-earth he passed and heard at last the weeping sore of\nwomen and of elven-maids in Elder Days, in years of yore. But on him\nmighty doom was laid, till Moon should fade, an orbéd star to pass, and\ntarry never more on Hither Shores where mortals are; for ever still a\nherald on an errand that should never rest to bear his shining lamp\nafar, the Flammifer of Westernesse."

The song is described as _“made on the model of the\ndwarf-song that started Bilbo on his adventure long ago, and went to the\nsame tune.”_\n\nThough begun by Merry and Pippin, also Frodo, and possibly Sam, joined\nin the singing, as Frodo himself makes up the last sentence.\n\n\nWords\n\nFarewell we call to hearth and hall!\n\nThough wind may blow and rain may fall,\n\nWe must away ere break of day\n\nFar over the wood and mountain tall.\n\nTo Rivendell, where Elves yet dwell\n\nIn glades beneath the misty fell,\n\nThrough moor and waste we ride in haste,\n\nAnd whither then we cannot tell.\n\nWith foes ahead, behind us dread,\n\nBeneath the sky shall be our bed,\n\nUntil at last our toil be passed,\n\nOur journey done, our errand sped.\n\nWe must away! We must away!\n\nWe ride before the break of day!\n"

It was sung by\nGollum in _The Lord of the Rings__ ''and _The Hobbit._\n\n\nLyrics\n\n“Gollum's Song” is sung by Gollum on several occasions. Part of\n“Gollum's song”''' '''can be found in _The Hobbit_. Gollum used it as a\nriddle when he and Bilbo had a riddle contest.\n\nAlive without breath; As cold as death; Never thirsting, ever drinking;\nClad in mail never clinking. Drowns on dry land, Thinks an island Is a\nmountain; Thinks a fountain Is a puff of air. So sleek, so fair! What a\njoy to meet! We only wish To catch a fish, So juicy-sweet!\n\nThe following lines were added to the beginning, probably made up on the\nspot, as Gollum led Frodo and Sam out of the Emyn Muil:\n\nThe cold hard lands, They bites our hands, They gnaws our feet. The\nrocks and stones Are like old bones All bare of meat. But stream and\npool Is wet and cool: So nice for feet! And now we wish--\n\nIn the films, an alternate but similar version is heard when Gollum\ncatches a fish in the Forbidden Pool:\n\nThe rock and pool Is nice and cool, So juicy-sweet! Our only wish, To\ncatch a fish, So juicy-sweet!"
