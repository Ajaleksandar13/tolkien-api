  "text": "'''Stone-trolls''' are huge trolls, slightly larger than [[hill-troll]]s, who turn into stone in direct [[Sun|sunlight]].\n\n==Habits==\n\nStone trolls tend to be dumb and ill-tempered. Almost all stone-trolls have first names, and a few (like William Huggins) had last names. Stone trolls eat things such as wild fowl, wild pigs/boars, [[dwarves]], [[hobbit]]s, and fish (if they could actually catch them). They hunted simply by chasing or ambushing the animals, then hitting them withÂ a [[weapon]] such as an axe or a club.\n\n==Shelter==\n\nStone-trolls commonly lived in caves or large burrows that went many yards underground, where they could shelter themselves from sunlight during the day. They slept on beds made of grasses and leaves or animal hides.\n\n==War==\n\nStone-trolls participated in the [[War of Wrath]], but they are not known to fight in any other wars. In the War of Wrath, they were used as beasts of burden and as shock troops, using giant [[axe]]s and clubs to frighten their foes.\n\n==Confusion==\n\nIt is hard to say what the term \"stone-troll\" actually means because generally almost all trolls turn to stone when hit by sunlight. One possible meaning (as used in [[The Fellowship of the Ring (novel)|the book version of ''Fellowship of the Ring'']]) is \"any troll that has been turned to stone by the sun\". Another possible meaning is that it is intended as an antonym for [[Olog-hai]], since they do not ever turn to stone."
