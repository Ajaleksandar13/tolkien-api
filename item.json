  "text": "TELCHAR was a Dwarf of Nogrod in the Blue Mountains during the First\nAge.\n\n\nBiography\n\nTelchar was one of the greatest smiths in the First Age of Middle-earth.\nHis master and teacher was Gamil Zirak the old.[1] Telchar was commonly\nregarded amongst the greatest smiths of all times save only Fëanor and\nCelebrimbor. Among his works were the knife Angrist, the sword Narsil\n(later reforged as the sword Andúril), and the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin.\n\nIt is unknown exactly when Telchar was alive or anything about any\nfamily that he had of his own, but it is known that the Dragon Helm of\nDor-lómin was made shortly after the dragon Glaurung first appeared, in\nthe 265th year of the First Age, which gives some clue.[2]\n\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nIn earlier versions of the story such as the second version of The Lay\nof the Children of Hurin (The Lays of Beleriend) and those in the The\nShaping of Middle-earth; Telchar was originally one of the Wicked\ndwarves of Belegost (certain elements got switched around including\nwhere dwarves originated from see Indrafang). In that version Telchar\nalso made the Dragon-helm in the dark dwarfland in the deeps of time.",
