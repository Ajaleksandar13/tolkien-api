  "text": "[LEGO Shagrat]\n\nSHAGRAT was a large, long-armed Black Uruk, Captain of the Tower of\nCirith Ungol, and the commander of one of the two orc patrols that found\nFrodo Baggins after he had been poisoned by Shelob. Later his Black Uruk\ntower garrison fought over possession of Frodo's Mithril mail-shirt with\nthe orc patrol from Minas Morgul led by Gorbag and sent up the Stair of\nCirith Ungol to investigate matters. Shagrat interpreted his orders\nliterally: all captives to be searched, but left unharmed and they and\ntheir possessions taken to Barad-dûr. Gorbag coveted Frodo's pretty\ndwarven mithril mail shirt for himself. A fight soon started. Gorbag\nwounded Shagrat in the arm with a knife, but was eventually killed by\nShagrat. Their respective followers began fighting also, and slaughtered\neach other wholesale over the next several hours.\n\nLater Sam, carrying the One Ring, infiltrated the Tower of Cirith Ungol\nand soon realized that the garrison was effectively wiped out.\nUnfortunately, Shagrat managed to get past him carrying Frodo's armor\nand other personal items and escaped to take them to Lugbúrz (Barad-dûr)\nas ordered.\n\nIt is possible that Shagrat was killed by Sauron or the authorities at\nBarad-dûr for the events that occurred at the Tower of Cirith Ungol.\nAlternatively, he may have been rewarded for his loyalty by being\nallowed to march to the Black Gate alongside his fellow orcs and Uruks\nas one of their captains. If so, it's unknown whether he was killed in\nthe battle or the subsequent destruction of Mordor following Sauron's\ndownfall, or if he survived and fled.",
