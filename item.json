  "text": "TOM, BERT, AND WILLIAM'S CAVE was a cave under a hill in\nEriador used by the trolls to hide from the Sunlight.\n\nThe cave was hidden by bushes and its entrance was locked by a heavy\nstone door which could only be opened with a key.\n\n\nHistory\n\nAfter Tom, Bert, and William were turned to stone by the morning Sun,\nThorin and Company followed the trolls' tracks up a hill and found their\ncave. At first they could not open it, but then Bilbo presented Gandalf\nwith a large key that he'd found on the ground where the trolls had\ntheir fight, that had no doubt fallen out William's pocket. The key\nopened the door, and they went inside.\n\nThey found the cave's interior filthy, with bones on the floor and a\nnasty smell, but the cave was a treasure-trove that housed all the\ntrolls' plunder, from brass buttons to pots full of gold coins. They\nfound clothes of the trolls' victims, and several swords of various\nmakes. Two of them had beautiful scabbards and jewelled hilts, and these\nturned out to be blades of Gondolin make: the elven-sword Glamdring,\nmeaning “foe hammer” (called “Beater” by the orcs which once belonged to\nKing Turgon), which Gandalf took, and Orcrist, meaning “goblin cleaver”\n(called “Biter” by the orcs), which Thorin took. Bilbo took a Gondolin\nknife in a leather sheath (the elven-blade he later named Sting).\n\nMore immediately useful to the group was food they found that appeared\nstill untouched, including bread, cheese, and bacon, and a barrel of ale\nstill full. They buried the pots of gold, putting spells over them in\ncase they ever had the chance to come back to recover it them.\n",
